I've rebooted, deleted cache, deleted data, rebooted into Safe Mode -- none of those bring show me the 8 voices I saw mere days ago.

You should make sure the app name in the app drawer is labeled correctly as \"Google Home\" not just \"home\" and make sure the app icon remains normal and does not get assigned a different icon via the system or other programs that change icons unless manually done. Great app but for some reason it is not creating the app icon in my app list, and no not hidden, the app is there and I can launch it from Google Play Store and it runs fine but I don't have an app icon to put on my desktop, tried uninstalling re-installing but that didn't fix the problem.

Their workaround was to create a shortcut saying something like :Play my playlist on google play music for 30 minutes and set alarm for 8:00. But this workaround didn't work for me since I want the shortcut to : Turn off all my smart devices , tell me the time ,tell me the weather for tomorrow ,set an alarm for 7 am and play TayFM for 20 mins. Hope either somebody at google notices this (not likely) or somebody who has the same issue with their google home gets the workaround to work for them. Sorry if I wasted anyone's time."}

{"Author": "Emma T", "Date": "May 3, 2018", "Stars": "Rated 2 stars out of five stars", "Text": "I used to love the Google Home controls when I first bought my Google Home Mini. Every since a recent update, I can no longer control the volume with the volume buttons on my device. I can only do it by voice, or by opening the Home app and doing multiple taps to get to the volume control. I love the voice commands when it makes sense to use them, but for the casting volume, I should still have the option to control it with my phone's volume buttons! It's much faster and not awkward like it is to have to keep saying \"okay Google\" over and over again while the music is playing and guessing the percentage of volume to change it until I get the desired volume. This is so annoying to the point where I stopped using my mini speaker and switched to a Bluetooth speaker. Also, the option to cast is hit or miss. I've had to restart the device and sometimes just talk to it to \"wake it up\" in order for it to show up as an available device to cast to. And if I say \"Okay Google,\" the phone and the Mini both respond, but they are not synced. My phone will start a call, and the mini will do another call at the same time, but they're two different calls. I'll just use my BT speaker until this gets fixed."}

All have been working great for months, commands worked flawlessly with no issues. We have several devices hooked up. (Honeywell Thermostat, several plugs from Leviton, and all light switches are Lutron Caseta Smart Lighting).  As of a week ago, I'm having issues.  1. Honeywell Thermostat:      I say, \"Set thermostat to 73\", and I get a response of, \"I'm sorry, there was an error and I'm unable to control your home device\".  But, it still changes the settings and does what I ask of it. All other commands work and get I correct responses, \"What temp is? Turn on, Turn Off, etc............I've unlinked accounts, relinked, factor reset on google home and thermostat, if it could be reset, I've done it and still get same results.  2. Leviton Plug: I have a fire place that has been hooked up for 3 months and for 3 months we say, \"Hey google, turn on / off the fire place\", and for 3 months it has worked. As of 2 days ago, googles response, \"Sorry, I don't understand\" So again, I reset, unlinked, etc....and it still doesn't work. So I experimented and changed the nickname to that plug to several different names, (tree, window, desk) and it works, but when i change it back to THE FIRE PLACE, it doesn't understand. I even changed it to \"the fire play\" and it worked. Currently its name is, THE FIRE, and it works fine. For some reason google doesn't recognize the word \"place\" anymore. I also retrained my voice, but this is an issue with all the accounts that are linked with our google homes, so it's just not my voice. Any help from google or anyone would be greatly appreciated. Spent money on these things and for them to not work for simple things is kind of annoying. Really thinking of switching them all out with Alexa. Thanks    "}

SINGLE. TIME. if I decide I want to cast anything to the TV or sound system from my device when I'm not already connected to Wi-Fi. Please, PLEASE fix this so that saved networks with hidden SSIDs show up when the user views the Available Networks list in Android WiFi Settings, no matter how they were added to the list! and not with a system update, as your company recently announced that my Pixel C and Nexus 6P won't recieve those any more and there's nothing on the market suitable to replace them with until, well, ever and Pixel 3, respectively.

I normally use Spotify for streaming to the Chromecasts (which has worked with no problems on my old HTC One). Now Spotify works fine once I've got the Chromecasts to appear, but when I stop casting the Pixel forgets about the Chromecasts again. I have no problems at all with my Toshiba Chromebook which will always see the Chromecasts and connect to them when using Spotify.

Unable to setup voice match, app hangs on please wait. I have searched online for a solution and see it is a known bug dating back many months. Google, in case you are unaware Australian consumer Law is awesome. The failure of this app and voice match feature make the Home Mini unfit for purpose or not function as advertised. This means I can return to the retailer for a refund. I urge all users of this app and Home mini with this issue to do the same. I also suggest this is a major fault under Australian consumer Law, and all future sales of the Home mini and associated products that don't function as advertised cease until this issue is resolved. I will be lodging a complaint about this product with NSW Fair Trading as you have falsely advertised this product and features."}

When it comes to Google home playing your Google play lists it doesn't live up to its advertised function. Stops playing my list. My lists work for a while then stop working. When they stop working it ether can't find my list that is there or plays a radio station instead. After a year of calling Google support nothing has changed. Not sure if hey want to fix it since they have a paid service. Won't even try their paid service. I don't know that the paid service will work since their non paid service doesn't work well. Work around is to rename the none working list then add it to a new Playlist with the old name. This works sometimes."}

This app can only locate the G.D. Chromecast half the time, and if watching more than 2 episodes of anything via Netflix or Hulu, my phone stops recognizing the TV. I have to shut EVERYTHING down - TV, phone, Chromecast, Wi-Fi - in order to try to get casting back under control, and it only occasionally works. Plus you have to constantly update Google, which leaves you with about the same level of privacy as the KGB. Plus their \"help\" sections are a joke. Do not go this route if you're trying to ditch cable, you will regret it."}

There is always going to be a learning curve in this type of application. But the problem is they keep changing things within the app and then cannot keep up with the changes on their online help pages. Sometimes it is faster to get information about a function that has changed name or location within the app, from the public on a message board or other means. So I guess my complaints can be summed up as they keep changing the names of functions. They keep splitting functions into two different new names. They are unable to keep up with the many changes they make with their own help pages. Because Google does not put out a concise how to use this app, such an obvious and clear bullet point in development of keeping the navigation consistent, should be a given."}

It took two days to figure out where the random videos were coming from in my history. I found out by turning the chromecast on and the music was playing so I'm guessing it was on since the moment my phone connected to the wifi."}

How awesome is that? \ud83d\ude09 Oh, and the best part:Google made it, so every update makes it buggier! Woo-hoo \ud83d\ude03Best. Money. Spent. Ever.

It deserves every bit of the 5 stars. After running it through a super-sensitive improvement scan this is the only suggestion: If there were widgets - really only one would do. This would be absolutely marvelous. A simple pause/play button with a volume bar, and maybe a button you can hold to prompt Google Home to listen (like you do when you long-press the top of the Home). Easily accessible from your home-screen. Convient - simple - marvelous - yes, yes indeed."}

Home will make you connect via wifi just to do something as simple as playing a song via Bluetooth. This is from a recent update for sure."}
