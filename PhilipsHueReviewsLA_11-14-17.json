Its not the best UI and is a slow process relative flicking a switch. So it feels like a config tool for the lights and in that regard it is pretty good.   My main compliant however is the app does not or cannot adapt to the current state of bulbs. For example, say you have lights dim  out every night at 10pm.  Rather than dimming down from the lights current state such as OFF, it will start on and dim to off. The lights were already off! Stupid.   Sees like a simple concept but  not there.

And I can tell you as an iPad user location-aware works just fine on iOS.  That is, quite simply, tremendously disrespectful to Android customers and very unprofessional.  I do love the concept of this product, it's a great idea, but the way Philips had handled this issue, which is to say, basically ignoring well-paying customers who can't use their broken products the way it was advertised, leaves a bad taste in my mouth with this company.  I've seen no sort of explanation or apology from Philips about this.  Just a disgusting display of apathy given a glaringly broken significant feature that has remained that way for months and months months.  If someone can think of a legitimate excuse for that please let me know.  EDIT:  Downgraded to one star.  No excuse for them to take THIS long to fix the Geofencing.  You don't take YEARS to fix a bug if you really cared.  As a customer I'm disgusted.  EDIT 2:  The broken Geofencing fix was long overdue (and that's an understatement) but it is here and after spending some time with it I finally feel like I have the product I paid good money for and updated my rating accordingly."}

The actual usability is awful. The original version of this app was far easier to use, manage, and understand. (My review of that app is a Shakespearean soliloquy.) This one will be in modern English and hopefully easy for Philip's (if they even read these) to understand. In short, THIS APP IS TERRIBLE!!! I don't give a lot of negative reviews not do I type in all caps much, but this app however, required a more direct approach. Philip's took a wonderfully functional, not without flaws but functional, and gave us this. The new app is convoluted, with many flaws. To list a small few :  - Control of individual lights is much more difficult. I don't always want every light in a room on.   - The entire concept of the \"scenes\" is poorly executed and not useful.   - Setup and modification of add-on switches and controls is beyond bad. store I'll stop there because I have better things to do with my day than audit a horrible app. It's really telling when the gen 1 version of the app has a 3.6 rating in the store currently, while the \"upgrade\" is at 2.9. Really, consider moving the team who created this to another part of your businesses and bring back the original team to update the old app. While there are far superior pay apps out there, I shouldn't have to buy an app just to get a usable product."}

Clearly the devs are not getting the push or resources to provide us with a better app. Think about smart lights 10 years from now. What do you want it to do? Make it happen now and use it in your company's marketing. Show the world why they need smart light bulbs and why you are the best. Don't wait for someone else to do it.. because it's going to happen with or without hue bulbs."}

You are still advertising that your products have features that you have not had working for years. YEARS! (EG GPS based features) isn't that at least a bit rude? It seems like you've basically given up on it, I mean, it worked years ago, then stopped working and you keep saying: \"we are trying to fix it!\" But on all packaging and advertising and the hue website advertise it as a working feature. Why don't you just think of all the features that hue might one day have and advertise all of them?! I mean, you're already engaging in false advertising. The quality of your new app is so bad and even the most obvious features took years to think of.. (eg: the option to turn your lights on before updating, so that you aren't stuck in darkness at random times, should have been accounted for when designing the app, at the very first meeting) and it is still not as reliable as the old app. The hue hardware is pretty good though, too bad about the app. I personally don't use the official app very often, as I have everything running flawlessly through third party apps like huepro and Tasker..  but every time it updates I give it a shot for a few days and it is just so bad, so bad when it could be so good. Why are these 3rd party apps made by a couple people so reliable and awesome!? Why can one guy program a third party app to do geofencing, but a multi billion dollar Company cannot?  But yeah just keep pumping out that hue hardware.. you've sold hundreds of millions of dollars of hue systems and I'm guessing you've put about 8 bucks into the development of the app. I no longer buy hue products to add to my system, nor do I recommend them to anyone."}

I've never had any problems that other people complain about.  I like the app, like my hue bulbs, and look forward to the soon coming day when I have all my bulbs switched over.  Edit. App us still working great.  Not a hitch.  I honestly don't understand all of the low ratings.  All works fine.  Someone gave a low rating because you couldn't put a bulb in two rooms?  So control more than I room with your switch or routine.  Someone else didn't like the color choice on wake?  Umm, then create your own wake routine and your own scene and use your own colors.  I tried hue pro that someone liked.  This is SO much more straightforward.  Oh, and still haven't had a glitch or crash in the app over several months.  My biggest complaint, if there is one, is that it has cost me a very pretty penny to change the whole house over to hue, but it was worth it.  I periodically try new apps with my bulbs and some do things that this doesn't.  Most are missing functionality and most are less stable than this is.  I use another app for animations when I want a party atmosphere but for 99% of what I do with my hue bulbs, this is my go-to, and I'm very happy with it.  Maybe people just like to gripe?"}

It's fast and simple and deserves recognition for that. Given that there are many different apps, all of which seem to specialize in different areas with no one single app providing EVERYTHING that you would want, this fits into the tool set usefully.  The Philips Hue app controls adding lights, naming them, assigning them to groups with relative ease. It handles updates to firmware and addition of accessories like the motion detector and dimmer switches more easily than other apps. It does *not* do color management or preset management well. If you are listening, Philips, I would love to have better preset management and ways to set up triggers and animations, using your accessories. The motion detector desperately needs a way to set end time. Better integration with IFTTT too.  There are apps on iOS which do creative things like animations that no Android app seems to handle well. But overall, this is a fine basic app. I use it for simple things, quickly, and it is fine."}

I also consider myself a casual user, I haven't even bothered with trying to set up location aware features (and it sounds like I shouldn't bother).  One minor gripe I have, the dimming sliders should not run from screen edge to screen edge, but just shy of both instead. Having any kind of case on the phone interferes with that edge. Likely a few pixel buffer would suffice without giving up to much screen real estate.  I'll update this rating if/when I go through and add more hue (or compatible) lights."}

Combining with other Android apps for Hue adds nice variety to just using the Hue app alone. Works with my Samsung Galaxy S6. Philips seems to advertise more of the Apple / iOS connection and not much about Android which for me was a bummer as it took lots of time to research to find out if it would in fact work with my Galaxy S6 and Android generally. Philips should try and make the connectivity to Android more clear.  A big chunk of us in the market are not Apple friends and prefer Android. On the whole love Hue!"}

But, I felt so strongly that I was compelled to write, as I hope if enough people complain Philips will take notice.  The app is useless.  I have to use a third party app (Hue Pro) to control my lights.  It is bad when an outsider does a better job at interacting with your product then your own app does.   I recently purchased a motion sensor to accompany to my lights.  However, I have to go through the official app to add it to my system, as I didn't see a way to do it in the 3rd-party app.  I am stuck in a never ending loop of \"An Update Is Available for your Hue Bridge\".  After watching it, rather unsuccessfully, look like it was partially installing the update, I get the message that an error occurred and to try again.  And not just once, but DOZENS of times. Just when it appears that all is not lost (and the app tells me that the update is successful), I click DONE and and it informs me that an update is available.  Hmmmm.  Weird, I just installed a freaking update like five times!!! Today!  And of course, there is no way to bypass this screen so that I can interact with my system. Conclusion: unless you love being frustrated, staring at the same screen over and over and have tons of time to waste, then you should find another app (like Hue Pro) to use for your bulbs.  Just know that adding accessories to your system is also going to be a pain.  If the app doesn't get better, I will never buy another bulb or accessory from Philips.   Isn't the point to make life easier?  Not make it infuriating."}

No way to import scenes from the previous version of the app. No way to manage groups of lights in the same room. And the list of missing features and regressions can go on. This app is a huge step backwards compared to the previous version. It's basically a tiny demo that shows some things the Philips Hue can do - playing with four default non-editable scenes, and hoping that somebody who invested a lot of money in Philips Hue lightbulbs, LED strips and friends will be happy with that. Luckily there's a lot of unofficial apps out there doing a better job, but I have no clue of how a serious company like Philips could tolerate such a shamefully low quality for their official app."}

I honestly am upgrading from a similar light that was bluetooth only and thought the same or similar would come from this app, not true.   At current there is no capability by the free version of this app that I am aware that will allow for the lights to make a transition. While there are moods on the app your light will be set at the previously established setting and color, for any changes it will have to be manually done. To be clear if you were looking to use sunset and your selection, after you select it your light will show that one color and the power of the bulb setting you make.   A more defined app would allow for your light to transition through all the colors in a continues pattern.  While I am giving a lower rating the interface with the Amazon Echo has been great!

I'm using ambient white bulbs and I like several of the available scenes.  What I don't like: - as others have said geofencing doesn't work (presumably because location aware doesn't stay on). Couldn't this be linked to the home wifi system? You can theoretically do that with IFTTT, but that doesn't work either; - there's no facility for lights to come on at random intervals for security purposes (I gather that was available in the older version of the app); - you have to set separate routines for \"on\" and \"off\" - why no facility to set lights on for a specified period? - there's no sleep timer (although the Go to Sleep routine works well)."}

You can always run V1 concurrently."}
