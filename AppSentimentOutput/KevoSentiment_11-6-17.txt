The privacy policy us almost as bad as Schlage's. Like most corporations they share with their partners which makes sense; however, how that information is protected and used beyond them is unspecified and not protected by the privacy policy. I would prefer apps and devices independent of GPS tracking, cloud based services, and data collection.  They should work independently of their creators. I like IP enabled devices that can be managed outside of their creators. I would be more comfortable with Quickset if they offered an app and device that did not collect or connect online. Just solely Bluetooth &amp; NFC

This app has been working great since February 2017 but since the last couple of updates it doesn't work properly in any consistent way. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7 on Android 6.1 and its reliability has dropped to such a low point that I now need to carry physical keys with me because it only works less than 40% of the time. Sometimes I log off and back on the app works and sometimes it doesn't. I'm having the same issue on a second phone an iPhone 6. These are both Kevo 1st generation deadbolts.  Same issue with both locks.

I have a Galaxy S8 plus. The app used to work fine on my phone until the most recent update in September 2017 and now it hasn't worked since. I feel like I've been scammed on a $230 lock that I now have to carry a key with me all the time. TiVo needs to step up their game quickly! This is baloney

Note 8, no app support. Based on other user reviews, apparently most android phones aren't supported. Prior to my note 8 my moto z would constantly stop working or reading the kevo, same with a pixel. It's apparent android isnt supported by kevo, but if so it should not be marketed as such... save me the headache and I would not have purchased!! Anyone reading this, don't buy (assuming you dont have an iPhone, because why would you be in the play store?)

The touch lock works when it feels like it. I carry a physical key around at all times since its on a business.   Setup is simple, easy to manage, battery life is ok.   But phone support also seems to be an issue. My brothers galaxy s8 seems to work, but my note 8 doesn't. All of our other phones are supported, but how well they work is hit or miss. My IPhone 6, fails almost every time. The iPhone 7 works well, and my old note 4 works every single time.   It's a terribly frustrating system from a reliability standpoint.

I give this app 2 stars because of the idea. The app is so unpredictable. It works, SOMETIMES. We got the KEVO lock for our front door to make it easier for my kids to lock the dang door when they leave the house (millennials find keys a nuisance, I suppose) but it defeats the purpose when the app works part of the time. Very disappointed, we will find a different solution soon.

It doesn't work really at all anymore. I'm at the point that I'm surprised when it does. I've allowed the annoying persistent notification to see if that would help, uninstalling and reinstalling, and even having the app open when trying to unlock. Useless. It's a pointless thing to use, since the idea is I don't have to take my key out but I have to for when it inevitably doesn't work.

Friend wanted me to stop by and pick up something from his place, "get the Kevo app and it'll let you unlock the door" he said. I signed up for an account, logged in and got the guest eKEY he sent me, went to his place and couldn't unlock the door with either of my phones. One is on the supported list and the other is new enough to have all the Bluetooth features required, yet neither works. Guess I won't be buying any for my own home.

I love the locks, they work great, when the software works. The problem is not with the physical locks(that's a good thing) the problem is with the software for the locks. The app loses the locks and will not connect anymore. This system works great for about a day or two, then I can't connect and have to completely uninstall the app, clear the data, reset my phone, reinstall the app, sign back in and then the system works great again... Of course, in the time that takes me, I could just pull out my old keys and be in the house with a cold one.  Please fix this app, I really want this to work. I invested two locks and want to add the plus system and a convert to my third door. However, if you can't keep up with the software development, I can't use you and that sucks.  Please fix the software.

This lock has come a long way. The latest updates really have improved the range and consistency with which is detects devices, and has eliminated most of the lag between when you touch your Kevo and when it actually unlocks. Not quite ready for prime-time yet, still a little flaky and will leave you standing at your door touching the lock wondering why it's not locking/unlocking every couple of times you to go use it. Fobs.. those still seem to be something of a dumpster fire. But hey, at least with the app on your phone things are improving!

Ok this product seems like it came straight out of R&amp;D. Let your engineers debug before selling a product. Anyways i had tons of issues with the lock "jamming". Apparently that was from the battery. But i have an issue with this thing working on Android. Update this app and fix the Bluetooth issue. It doesn't work until i restart my phone, then it works for a couple hours and again won't find the lock. It's obviously a software bug because iPhone works fine.

Dont waste your money on this hyped up doorlock and go back to the manual ways. Kwikset/KEVO you should be embarassed with this product and the support it doesnt even provide.

Installation was easy, and the setup was painless. When I downloaded the app, it initially stated that my Galaxy S6 Active wasn't compatible, but I was still able to calibrate both it and my key fob with no problems.

I had high hopes for this app since I purchased my Kevo lock (which I love).  Unfortunately the app says my phone isn't fully supported and I cannot use the touch to unlock feature or ekeys which is what I was interested in.  The problem is my phone is a Samsung Galaxy S5 which is supported and I use other BLE/BT4 devices such as the tracking tags named 'Tile'.  Not sure why my phone is not detected properly, I would really like to use this app and give it a great rating.  If anyone knows of a way to resolve this lemme know, I'd appreciate it!

Worst designed app/lock on the market.  Why would you make a lock or app where only 2 functions work on majority of Android phones? This is just ridiculous.  The lock is a waste of money, the app doesn't work. One fob for a household and only 2 ekeys  for the cost of the lock.  That's a complete ripoff.  Plus no support in Australia. Have serious issues just connecting via Bluetooth. Waste of money and time

Just upgraded to a 2nd Gen Kevo, and right away it works much much better than a 1st Gen Kevo. Kwikset should just recall all 1st Gens due to how unreliable it is. With a 2nd Gen Kevo the app (and fob) works almost instantaneously and reliably. A 1st Gen would always take forever and only work 30% of the time, requiring multiple retries or use of a physical key. The only issue that needs to be fixed is Android Wear 2.0 compatibility (force closes on Moto360).

Slow to connect, I stood at my door for 5 minutes waiting for it to connect to unlock. Also having problems connecting with multiple devices. It's incredibly slow for all devices to unlock or lock. We have 2 Samsung Note 5's and a Samsung S7 Edge. We uninstalled the lock due to it unlocking itself. Reinstalled after we moved. Still worried it will unlock itself after I walk away like previously. Well probably try to convince husband to go with different wireless lock that's faster and less risky.

This app works well with my Weiser bluetooth lock.  My LG G6 works with touch to open feature although the app showed question marks. A call to support revealed the instructions were outdated and the tech was able to help me program the phone correctly. 4 stars because of under developed android support.  I can't get the touch to open feature to work with the LG G4 even though it is Android Marshmellow 6.0 and Bluetooth 4 compatible. 5 stars for better android support and functionality on phones that are hardware capable.

Not only does this app just flat out not work properly, the product itself doesn't work properly and might be the most frustrating  home product ever created.  Unless you like approching your door, putting the kid down, your bag down, rifling around trying to find your phone, opening the app and then the door only opening 10% of the time after waiting 60 seconds for everything to sync up...this product isn't for you.

It works fine.  Sometimes it gets confused and loses ability to unlock with phone.  Restarting Bluetooth on phone resolves it.  Wish it didn't do that.  Ever since android wear updated to 2.0, I can't get the app to link with watch, so can't unlock with watch anymore.  That's a bummer.

I have tried so hard to support Kevo, and they have made a good product. But why haven't they certified more phones after all this time? My 2014 HTC M8 wasn't supported, my 2015 M9 was lost and replaced by insurance with a 2017 LG G6 which uses the latest BLE specifications, but hasn't been certified by Kevo. This is so disappointing...I keep trying to support this product but they seem to have given up on it.

The app is very minimal.  Basic functions that should be present such as seeing the lock status on the hone screen, widgets, and any customization are absent.  The honeywell connected feature is worthless since it thinks anytime a door is locked that you are away.

On newer versions of Android, you likely need to give location access permission in the settings of the app in order for the app to work. My Moto  Z Force Droid isn't listed as supported, but works just fine after I make the change. The developer needs to add a prompt for the permission so people don't have to dig in the phone's settings, but other then that, I have had no issues.

Works as I would expect. The instructions said it would not be compatible with my existing lock however it came with everything I needed even if I had no existing lock. The app started off a little finicky due to the verification process. Just remember to close the app after completing the verification process then opening it and starting your ekeying procedures. I use the same account on both my phone and my wife's phone so I did not have to generate another set of keys however this may cause me issues later, I guess I will find out. I love the fact that it does not connect to the Internet so it being hacked is less of a worry. Locks do not need access to the internet due to your phone being able to program them locally and you can email the ekey to someone if they need to get in without you being home. I have not tried this yet but hopefully will soon. The only issue I have at the moment is the possibility of your phone being too close to the lock while being home which can allow someone to walk up and unlock your door if your phone is too close. That can be solved by simply turning off your Bluetooth while at home but that is not something people will like to do. So far it works great with no issues.

Awesome!  Very easy to install.  Instructions are detailed and easy to follow.  Pairing was simple enough however pairing my wife's phone required me to send her an ekey which wasn't explained.  Also setting up the app requires that you give it location permissions.  No problem with that but the app should ask during installation instead of having to change permissions in settings.  This is a must have for anyone.  I love the ekey sharing feature.  I can give someone temporary access or revoke anytime.  Very nice!

Intrusive and poorly designed.  Constant notification on your phone that says "your Kevo is running"... No kidding, it'd better be, for the huge cost of the thing!  I shouldn't have to deal with your advertising when I've paid you hundreds of dollars got a product I'm literally using multiple times everyday anyway!  If you block the stupid notification then you can't get notifications about lock events.  And, BTW, it forces you to receive [useless] emails as well as push notifications for those events.  AND you have to set up each event (lock and unlock) separately for each individual key-holder!  Even being the best most convenient smart lock on the market they make it very hard to justify paying their insanely high price for the thing with this absolutely garbage app.  Oh and BTW it doesn't work with Google Assistant like the rest of their smart locks, and everyone else's, for that matter.

I bought the 1st gen kevo.  When installed I was prompted to do a update. Which kept failing.  Called kevo, they said it was the unit and they were going to send me a REFURB IN REPLACEMENT.  A REFURB!!!. This is because they are back ordered for 2 months. My unit was brand new.  I brought it back to best buy and exchanged and paid the difference on a 2nd gen kevo that has the same issue.  It will not update and the app is useless.  I have a samsung galaxy s6 edge, Bluetooth enabled with sharing.  Great idea poorly made.  Very disappointing. Will be returning...  also their customer service reps have very little information that helps. Sorry kevo I was very excited but you disappointed me.

The app or website does not let a signed in user reset their security questions. Horribly slow support when I contacted them about it, they did not answer my question or resolve it but instead just asked why would someone want to do that. Also this is a security issue if you can't reset your security questions, and yet it's supposed to secure my house?   Cannot update my own security questions.

I paid alot of money for a door I have to use my key for anyway. At first I was having problems with it locking me out. But I fixed that by making sure I did not leave my phone within 50 feet of the door and I turned on the tap three times to lock. I think I would like this better if it was WiFi and could connect without having to purchase the additional bridge.

Takes a long time to connect to my S7 Edge but connects to my husband's 7 Plus pretty quickly. Does not register if door is locked/unlocked by key or by hand so you won't see that in the history (my child still uses a key). Sometimes when it connects it won't unlock (got stuck outside once without a physical key and the Kevo wouldn't unlock, late to work that day).

Sometimes the bolt will pop out when the door isn't shut or while the door is closing causing it to hit the deadbolt hard. Deadbolt should be arter than that. Somewhat slow to react to touch. Should be a better way to share keys. Extra keys are not free.

Phone bluetooth connection needs major improvements, battery life is very short, rechargable batteries highly recommended, the Kevo fob is worth every penny but defeats the purpose, Kevo Plus is awesome, highly encourage the investment, it's the best part of the Kevo setup without the Plus I would give it a 3 stars

For Kevo locks. Great idea. Great looking design. Terrible lock firmware and terrible support for this app. The locks really don't behave as advertised. To actually control or monitor the locks remotely, you have to buy the overpriced Kevo bridge that is never in stock. For this app, it took them in excess of 6 months to support Google Pixels. Didn't bother to replace the batteries in the Kevo. Planning to swap out the locks with Schlage ones this summer. Also updating all the door hardware in the house. Will not by Kwikset anything ever again.

I have this app installed on a Note 5 and a Pixel and they both have horrible bluetooth connectivity problems. I was so excited because the newest update allowed installation on my Pixel, and while I can lock/unlock within range, I can't update the lock. My Note 5 won't connect at all to lock/unlock or update. So so so frustrated that my $200+ lock isn't working as it's supposed to because of these app problems.

This is a garbage system. I walked out of the house brushing the lock, activating then. Then I touched the lock again and it said the battery was low. I touched it a second time and was prompted to update to a newer version. I go to update and you have to remove the cover and hit the program button. Easy enough if you are in your house! I habe had this system for over a year and it is garbage. Spend your money on nest or something else.

Constantly turns my Bluetooth off on my pixel. You never know it did it until you are driving around on the road and need to use your handsfree.

My whole family enjoys the convenience of the Kevo 2nd gen and Kevo plus hub. I ran into issues trying to install the hub A: I am not the owner of the lock and B: the directions aren't very clear. We called customer service and they were extremely helpful and courteous. When the direction tell you to follow in app instructions. You must first push the + sign in the app to add the hub. No where and I repeat no where that I looked whether it was online or in forums did it say this. Since then we have had the hub hooked up for a week with no issues. We have been using the lock for 3 weeks. We did notice before the hub there was a little bit of a lag when locking or unlocking by Bluetooth but since it seems to be more efficient. The sending of ekeys is an excellent bonus we have used this option multiple times with no problems.

Terrible. I thought this would make my life easier. I hate that I have to have my Bluetooth on all the time. When I'm standing on my front to step searching for my phone then have to wait forever while it says 'searching, searching, searching...ERROR' I've never actually been able to use it the way it is supposed to work and always have to use my key. Just a $300 manual lock for my door.

Ashley says it who t work with an Android. Ashley, it does. Another stated support it terrible. For various reasons I have called support. Might need to wait 5 or 10 minutes, but they were VERY friendly &amp; knowledgeable. I even emailed a couple questions and answers arrived in less than 48 hours. The locks work great, I swapped the batteries for the best i could find before installing the locks cause I'm smart...  Also, works great with Alexa (and add on unit). If you can Google, then there is no reason what so ever to say there are no I instructions or they are not clear.  The locks rock and so does their tech support.

I like it. It has needed a bit of coaxing, but nothing beyond a reinstall of software on one phone and replacing batteries one time. Have a first gen (2+ years) and a second gen (1 year). My parents now have one too, and it was a set it, forget it. Mostly Nexus and Motorola products. The iPhone always needs the app open....good thing the parents have Nexus phones!!! ;)

I've had this lock for around 2 years now and have NEVER used the physical key.

Nexus 5 + software update seems to have it working OK now. Still gotta awkwardly lift my hip up. Designed for purses, not pockets. Before: the range makes it almost useless (has to be about a millimeter or so away from the lock). But the almost worst part is the run-in-background stopped working. The worst part is that it stopped working in the background with the last iPhone upgrade, and they were all over it, fixed quickly. In this household, Android bought the lock, so neglecting it is not good.

As other reviewers have stated, this is a really disappointing product thus far. Latest update killed my eKey on Android. It was working... not anymore.

I've had my Kevo lock for over a year and it has never worked correctly. This is one of the worst purchases I have EVER made. I have to hold my phone within about 1" of the lock for it to work and I have ro tap on rhe lock 3-4 times before it finally works.  Sometimes i give up and use my key.  I'll open the door and the Kevo will finally operate, but after I have already unlocked it manually and opened the door. So the deadbolt will be in the locked or "out" position when I am trying to close the door. I'll manually unlock it close the door and lock it .....the the Kevo will unlock the door when I want it locked.

Do not buy a Kevo. I repeat, do not buy one of these. They work intermittently, if at all. It takes longer to get it to recognize your touch than to get out the key. Then,when I got a new phone, the Lenovo Phab2 Pro, which is running Android 6.0.1, the app says it is not compatible. What? Keep your money.  Postscript: Well, go figure. A company that listens to its customers. I have now been able to install the app on my new phone. It says it is unsupported, but is working now. I am having some difficulties updating the lock software; but, it is looking good. Thanks Kwikset. You have me back as a customer. Four stars.

So glad Kevo is finally available on Android.  The app functions as intended on my Nexus 6.  Locking/unlocking works every time, no issue so far.  One feature you may consider adding to the app before it comes out of beta is to detect whether bluetooth is turned on when the app is first being set up (and to remind the user to turn on the bluetooth if it is off).  It will smooth out any issues with users who may not realize that their bt is turned off and wonder why their phone isn't communicating with the lock.  Update:  App is now also compatible with Google Pixel.

Nexus 5 + software update seems to have it working OK now. Still gotta awkwardly lift my hip up. Designed for purses, not pockets. Before: the range makes it almost useless (has to be about a millimeter or so away from the lock). But the almost worst part is the run-in-background stopped working. The worst part is that it stopped working in the background with the last iPhone upgrade, and they were all over it, fixed quickly. In this household, Android bought the lock, so neglecting it is not good.

I've had this look for about 2 years. It's had many support issues with Android phones in that time. The new update to 2.0 seems to have finally resolved it.

This update is horrible. It searches for the lock for about 20 seconds THEN, if it even connects, it only connects on the inside. Apparently with this new update my door also became too think to get a signal, leaving me unable to open it from the outside. Horrible update, how do I roll it back?

Much better now that I don't have to side load.  My biggest complaint is that you can't see the history for all entries and exits (manual key and fob) and you can't control the day / time access for a fob.  I can't give a service an e-key as it changes people, but I can give out a fob.  However you loose all capabilities with the fob and have to reset the device to remove it if lost.

The website shows an ability to update the lock yet it looks noting like what was pictured on the website. I am giving this such a low rating because we have so many problems with this lock. Random locks and unlocks, even when I am several feet away. With the new app it is also dodgy, dosent want to lock when touching the lock but it will unlock. It seems fine but slow when locking and unlocking from the app.

Would like to see more phones supported rather than just a few of the top models. I had to side load the app from a file share site cause my Moto X pure still isn't supported the app works fine but phone still won't pair directly to lock as owner but still control locks as long as my phone is on my side.  The unlimited ekeys is a nice bonus that kinda should've been free all along but still nice to have now,  next I need the plus add on

Just bought and installed two Kevo locks. It worked fine but then I bought a new phone, Google Pixel. I went to install this app on my new phone to find out I can't download it because it says my phone is not supported by this app. So I can't use my phone to unlock my doors which is why i bought this lock. Therefore this lock will limit your phone choices and if you buy a new phone it probably will not work with this lock. They are slow to add new phones like the Google Pixel, which is still not supported even though it is running a supported Android version.

Spend money on a lock and keep spending App is ok, but it keeps insisting in getting me to spend more money on the "plus" version. I can put up with with the banter for the plus version for which I have no use, but I find it disgusting that you have to pay for extra E-keys. Perfect example of how companies find a way in your pocket and they keep wanting more and more. There is absolutely no measurable cost for creating the ekey but you still have to pay for it. Going back to simple locks but will make it a point not to buy from the same company.

Generally good. The app does what it needs to do and I find the lock itself quiet good. E-keyes costing additional money is fairly ridiculous. I get it, actual keys cost about 2$ per key. But we aren't using real keys, so that's an incredibly thin justification. You wouldn't charge to send an email just because it cost money to send a letter. My other gripe is Kevo's assumption that I want them in my notification bar 24/7. Thankfully you can hide the notifications from specific apps in Android

Unreliable and tedious Unnecessarily updates literally every single time you open the app, connection is only 50% of the time.

Ever since kevo update, the lock sucks Spoke with customer service they sent me a refurbished replacement lock that worked for one day and then the next day it keeps saying connecting..... non stop then says that location services  needs to be on. Turned it on then says won't connect. Try to delete ekey , now it won't pair with phone. I try to reset phone and app with no luck. Frustrating experience.

Pointless The box and advertising says you need a phone with Android 5.0 or higher. Out of 4 phones with 5.0 or higher, ONE works. The others are "incompatible ". Basically Kwikset decided only certain phones will work, regardless of the Android version.

Inconsistency w/ lock (not the app) Kevo 1st Gen w/ Samsung Galaxy S7. Significant battery drain on the lock itself. I've change 3 sets of batteries in two months. This is really strange because the original set of batteries used on lock installation lasted almost a year. Now the lock is sucking the energy out of my energizers. The lock is also slow to recognize when it's been touched (tempermental). I now have to wait about 30 seconds before touching to lockup. Not to mention the incredibly slow response of Kevo Plus!

I have a Samsung s7 edge plus. I love the concept of this lock, but the execution is horrible. I bought the lock because I was led to believe that all I would have to do was have my phone in my pocket and I could unlock my door with the touch of a a finger. I reality I touch the lock, the blue ring flashes, then I have to take my phone out of my pocket notice that the app is sleeping, then open the app because it tells me to move my phone to awaken it but it won't, once I open the app, it will connect to the lock and then I can open it with the touch of my finger. I wish that they would have told me that this was the way that they had programmed it and I would have saved myself $180 buck and not bought this. The great part is that I have tried to call their support line but they are closed due to a system outage.

For anyone with a Pixel or Pixel XL the Kevo app should work on your phone.  Works on my Pixel.  You just need to copy the app from your old phone (if you still have it) to your new and install it.  There are apps in the store that let you 'extract' the Kevo installer from your old phone.

Lost one star because you want another  $180 in Canada to upgraded to Kevo Plus. For the price of the lock you should not be asking for more money to get all features to work. Other than that it works good with Samsung S7 especially after the latest app update.  Have had to open the app and use it a few times in the past to get the lock to work and then it seems to make it work properly again for  a while but since the latest app update it seems to be more reliable and works immediately .

Love the lock, Major Android Wear issues Installed lock, set up app and everything worked perfect.  Came back and lock wouldn't open and couldn't get it to. Uninstalled and reinstalled app and is working fine.  Constant crashes on my moto 360 like other users are reporting.  Once fixed easily a 5 star app.  It has been a good couple months now and still no fix for Android Wear and there is no way to deactivate Android Wear support, every few minutes I look at my watch and it says "unfortunately Kevo has stopped", this seriously needs to be fixed.

Kevo could definitely offer a bit more. Kevo is great on the Android.. But as the title says this is a hefty chunk of change for a deadbolt that you have to resign into every time you shut off your phone and where is the ability to setup lock and unlock alerts/notifications? Another feature that seems pretty simple to add to this device would be if there was say 3-4 attempts to open the door it sends you an alert would be nice to know if your kids forgot their key you would know or if someone was trying to break in/pick the lock.

Challenges are app is not working on android wear and crashes when you open it.  Cannot use on android wear. They charge you for additional keys. Really?

Works Great!  Love it but could be better... Many bad reviews have nothing to do with the app and are regarding configuration/setup issues with the device.  I had no trouble installing, programming and using the device or this app.  I knocked one star off because occasionally if you accidentally touch the lock while shutting the door it'll lock as your closing it. IMO thats user error but should be a sensor on the device to prevent it from happening. Should include manual lock/unlocks in history &amp; key fob should have disable option, not require reset!

Slow to update. Ever since an android wear update 3 months ago, I constantly get a message saying "unfortunately kevo has stopped" and the battery on the watch drains faster because of the full white screen.

This has to be the worst app ever. The error on the Android Wear keep popping up even after multiple updates of the app and number so complaints from other users.

Nerds trying skilled trade and fail. This lock works perfect. The main complaints you will see on here are that the lock starts to work and fails or some compatibility issues with the app. The lock jammed on me, but I'm not dumb so I chiseled the hole on the door frame to make sure the lock cleared the hole. Amazing it worked. It's really crazy that following directions and critical thinking worked. Not some mindless regurgitation of facts. So do some research, and make sure you know what you're doing before you buy this lock and rate it bad.

To be clear, the lock is terrific!  The fob is terrific.  The app is terrific.  The Android Wear component is a total nightmare that repeatedly crashed and alerts on the phone, dozens of times a day.  It's not OK, and the only solution offered is from the online community, requiring some additional tools and minor scripting skills to disable it.  Really?  UniKey has had months to address this and has not.  The only mainstream option is to remove the app from the phone, which is not a reasonable solution.  FIX NOW.  Buy the lock, use the fob, and use the app... as long as you don't use Android Wear.

No consistency! Why does the lock work perfectly one hour then the next hour you need to fumble with your phone to "open" the app when it was never closed? I've had this for a month and I have not been able to rely on this product at all, thank goodness I keep the real key on my key ring to get me in the house when the app decides to not respond!! Great concept but terrible performance. When does the next "upgrade" come out? For being Bluetooth based this is lousy, fix ASAP! Will the developers actually listen to us?

App gets worse with every update.  No longer runs in the background.  No longer connects to the lock unless I start the app and push the open button in the app.  It has started asking for my password all of the time.  The last good version was 1.0.27p.  Luckily some members of my family never update so we can still uplock the door without dropping everything to run the app.  Looks like Kwikset has given up on the Kevo.

Terrible, inconsistent and poorly designed There are many issues with the kevo. I am aware of how smart home devices SHOULD  work and where issues may lie and kevo still falls VERY short of a quality product. It is an absolute joke that additional keys for your already purchased product cost money, especially at the price tag of this unit. It has poor app design, this product is very inconsistent and claims of app compatibility with other smart devices feels more like a trick. There is potential here but it is far from a quality product now.

Still far too many Kevo taps where the lock does nothing; it needs 99% success rate for taps when the phone is in my front pocket, but I'm getting somewhere between 50-75%. It has been better since version 1.2.24p and the updated lock firmware 1.4.13. Previously I was getting lots of missed taps. The Works With Nest integration is awesome.

I just purchased a new 2nd gen Moto 360 watch. Recently, the Kevo lock and app have been functional, if a little unreliable (~80% success rate locking and unlocking). Whereas before the app would lose access to my phone's Bluetooth, requiring me to turn Bluetooth off and back on before I could lock or unlock my door.  Now, after pairing my watch, I found that Kevo stopped working altogether on my phone. I also now have regular Kevo FC messages on my wearable. Honestly, metal keys are far less frustrating.

I have it on the 6P but if I ever took it off I wouldn't be able to put it back on - absolutely ridiculous, especially for something that is supposed to be as essential as a lock for your home.  2. Constantly, and I mean constantly, crashes on Android Wear, and there is no way to disable it on my Wear device.

The android app is a festering pile of poo. It is a battery pig, it has a wear component that crashes 12-20 times a day. The functionality for wear isnt active until wear 2.0 comes out, and you cant disable it from running the wear component so a 2nd and 3rd poke in the eye. I had to use my wifes iphone to update the locks, then uninstall and reinstall the android app to get the locks to work with my android nexus 6p.  Unikey does NOT respond to requests for help from their webpage or the kevo page. The lock is excellent, the software is poop. They should be embarrassed and their mother should smack them.

The new app just got released an hour ago, so I had to reset my device to add my new smart device as main key (otherwise it didn't work). On the app, I can't find fhe calibrate option. So I can only open the lock with the app, not my phone. Please fix, and all will be great again.

Lock works flawlessly, app hardly works at all I have no problems using the kevo on a day to day basis with my phone in my pocket and touching the deadbolt, however the app will not stay open on my Nexus 6P. As soon as the app detects my kevo it closes itself without any warning, which means I can't manage my ekeys from my phone if I'm in my house with my Bluetooth active. Thankfully I don't use the ekey feature often, but the app needs to be fixed.

Not compatible with Moto X Pure  I can't even install it on the Moto X Pure.

I almost did not buy this lock! I followed the instructions and set up my android phone (S6), and my wife's iPhone 6, the fob for my younger daughter, added an extra ekey for my oldest daughter and gave my scared of Technology mother a phiscal key. Set up the inside vs outside detection on everything and waited for stuff to go wrong. It all works. Next time I go to the mall I will pick up 2 more fobs for guests and my youngest son. I will change this review if things change but for now I'm 100% satisfied. FTR the iPhone app is much nicer.

How is there not a release for Android 6.0?? I bought the kevo lock before upgrading my phone to the galaxy s7 edge which runs Android Marshmallow. Much to my chagrin, the Kevo App is not compaible...Now my lock is no better than any other lock; I have to use a key! The whole point of buying the Kevo was so I could enter my house by way of phone.   Android Marshmallow dropped in October of 2015....  Updates to the app have been made since.

I'm about ready to toss this lock into the bin.     History: Prior to purchasing a $900+ phone I made absolutely certain it was compatible with the lock (Note 4 Edge w/ Lollipop 5.11 - STOCK).    Got the phone home, only to be advised by Google Play that the app is incompatible.   After a few days, and many hours with tech support, uninstalling, reinstalling etc. etc. it was finally resolved by them tweaking something on their end.  Current Status: Update phone to Marshmallow (6.0.1 - STOCK) a few weeks ago, and all continues to work fine.  Reset my phone to factory tonight, go to download app and the farking thing is telling me it is incompatible.  This is utter crap.  It has been working just fine under Marshmallow for weeks.  Now I have an expensive lock I cannot lock/unlock VIA the phone.  This is clearly the ONLY reason to purchase said lock.   Y'all need to allow the app to be loaded, or refund my money.  I'm tired of hoop jumping.

Terrible lock. Could be great... When it works you realize how convenient a smart lock can be. However it rarely works problem free for longer than a few days making it impossible to trust as a primary door lock. Kevo Plus needs major improvements. The app never gave up to date status reports and when unlocking and locking remotely I found that it worked the first attempt only 10℅ of the time. Most often multiple attempts were needed taking upwards of 5 minutes to finally unlock. I purchased 4 locks giving Kevo as much a chance as possible

Kevo seemed like a good idea.  The deadbolt is expensive, yet they have the audacity to charge extra money ($100) for the "functioning" version of the app and hardware (check / lock / unlock out of bluetooth range).  They also would like you to pay extra for VIRTUAL KEYS!!!  Really?  The Kevo does not link with the home automation hub, Wink, not sure if it works with Samsung or Apple's automation products, remote access requires their junk.  The lock doesn't work if you're already paired to a bluetooth device.  The app force closes on my Moto360 watch.    The physical quality of the lock is about a 3/10, I'm pretty sure you could defeat the lock with a decent screwdriver.  The lock is very loud, both mechanically as well as the beep tones if you leave them enabled.  This one is going back to the store, I'll stick with a good old regular z-wave lock, my Wink hub loves z-wave.  If someone is going to break in, I'd rather it be a hacker than a kid with a screwdriver.  Nest integration works ***great.  You lock the door and it tells the Nest to cook the remaining occupants in the house.

How is it that a lock built for people into technology isn't compatible with the latest Android phones like the Note 7. Better yet Android  Marshmallow? See the users of Android have been lied to for too long. We are always the ones that suffer while iOS is developed and updated right away. I preordered my first Kevo with the promise of an "Android app coming soon". Actually what happened is they took there time and waited 1.5 years to even release an android app. I patiently sat around and even ended up buying an iPad mini so that I did not have to use the key fob, that did not work half as well as it should have, just to get an app to update my lock and be able to open my door. So the next hurdle has been that suddenly I can't install this on the newest android phones. It has been like this going on a month. I tell you what UniKey..... You can keep your Kevo 2 and stick it where the sun doesn't shine. You claim to have heard peoples issues with your device, but it looks like to me the only thing you did was redesign the mechanics of the lock and added a few new features..... How is this lock any good if you don't support or upgrade the app in a timely fashion. I am keeping my 200

Nice Interface, some lock issues. App has a great user-friendly interface and offers a lot features with my new Kevo lock. However, after installing the app I quickly noticed a firmware upgrade for my newly installed lock. The update itself went smoothly, taking roughly 15 minutes. Myself and others then started to experience issues with the lock detecting our app during our comings and goings. This applied to both Android users (Lollipop and Marshmallow), and an iPhone user. Had to pull the batteries, and reseat them to resolve.

It is supposed to work with a Samsung Gear S2 as well as other Android Wear. However, I cannot get it to work. It states "Update Required These locks can be used with your Android Wear device after you perform a software update." I cannot find any way to update and there are no instructions online to help. If there was support out there I would greatly appreciate it, but products shouldn't be advertised as working with no assistance. Up until now I truly enjoyed the product.

Works great Nexus 6, but 1 Greatly Annoying Feature Works great with Nexus 6, and from as far away as I can reach as long as nothing is in front of my phone in my pocket.  Major Problem is that it keeps a notification, at the top of your notification list too, about the status of the app.  Is it sleeping, is it working, is Bluetooth off.  There is no way to remove the notification, it is always there acting smug.  If I wanted some usless information cluttering my screen I wouldn't have bought an android device.

With the Ring I get notified on my Note 4 whenever there is motion on my front door step. I can see &amp; talk to whoever is at my door.

The app asks you about bluetooth every time you go to the main menu - I have Plus, I don't need bluetooth. It also crashes quite frequently.

Reliable Frustration Would have to be one of the most annoyingly unreliable and frustrating products I've ever bought. Inconsistent experience when you need a reliable means to access or lock your home. This device is not able to be trusted. And support is woeful. If I could give zero stars I would. When it works, it works as 'it should'. Use the fobs, slow and unreliable. Use the manual search lock/unlock 'feature' - painfully slow and unreliable.

Poor product ridiculous prices This product (lock and software) is terrible. Everytime I touch the lock I need to pull out my phone and wake it up. Might as well use a key.  The fob doesn't work at all. And Kevo expects people to pay $70 for the upgrade version of the app?  I would have taken the lock back if it wasn't such a pain in the butt to install.

Worked great... Once I installed the app, got a key, used it, locked my door, and went to sleep. The next morning, and every time afterward, the door would not unlock. The app claims that my Bluetooth is off when I have it on and working (I was streaming music to my Bluetooth headset not two minutes prior). The lock itself is definitely working because my brother and his girlfriend can both unlock the door with their iPhone apps. Seems like this app is really flaky and it needs to be fixed. Until then, physical keys for me

Disappointing and embarrassed It locks and unlocks. Big whoop,  all locks do that.Kevo advertises it to look awesome. They don't clearly tell you that you have to have the "plus"  device to use the best features (remote monitoring, remote lock... ) which is unavailable. Wtf?  There are no "scheduled" keys or limited time keys either. They advertise that it work with wearable devices. Not true today. I'm embarrassed that I bragged about this device.

Inconsistent and buggy When you get lucky this seems decent enough, but sooner or later youll start to have trouble getting the door to unlock. Youll try to recalibrate it and have the app tell you it cant without giving you a reason. It will tell you to reset the lock. Youll reset the lock and then never be able to recalibrate your phone again, then have to reprogram the fobs. You'll have trouble re calibrating the fobs. After hours of messing with it youll give up, uninstall the whole lock, and wish you had never bothered.

Good idea poorly executed. Just use a key. The lock itself is cheap and nasty. I wrote along letter of complaint pointing out some of the basic flaws but never got a reply. Like everyone here had issues getting it to open across a few devices. Better with just one administrator sending ekeys as it doesn't cope too well with multiple registrations. But the biggest thorn in my side is they have just updated the software so that it has functions similar to the more expensive locks like Lockwood. But to access the new features you have to pay $69.99!!!!

Everything I wanted and more. I bought this lock because I hate fumbling with my keys in the dark, or having to go back to my truck when I leave it running and my wife has the door locked.

Way to long for Android support I was told when I bought this I would get 5 free ekeys.  To my disappointment they were behind the times with their technology and only supported apple phones.  I was told not to take the lock back because they would have Android support by the summer of 2014. Well we know that did not happen.  Then they said my free ekeyes were linked to my account and not to worry about losing them.  Well that was also  lie because now they want to charge me for the right to unlock my own door.

Decent We don't need the constant instruction to "tap your kevo to unlock" in our notifications.  We get it.  When Bluetooth is on, we can tap to unlock.   Maybe just have an initial notification upon connecting that is able to be cleared.  Not an unclearable instruction that never goes away. Update:  Although the constant notification remains and is annoying, you get a 4th star for adding the remote lock/unlock feature.

Works very well on my note 5. I have to agree with another poster below and that all of these people giving 1 stars due to Blu tooth issues is misleading.

Works very well on my wife's iPhone 7 and iPhone se, however,  they DO need the app running in back ground to work (sucks to be apple)

Works as described. Responsive dev team No major complaints - some initial bugs were there in this Beta release, that the responsive dev team addressed. Hopefully, the dev team will continue to be responsive after this becomes more widely adopted :)

Atrocious App makes you PAY for people to have keys (ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!) and then DOESN'T WORK on several phones (like the Nexus 5, a very standard phone). Removing lock from door, sending back. 100% not worth it.

Great product, app works awesome, wear support is bad App is great, especially with the Kevo Plus Gateway.  Constantly force closing on my moto 360 gen 2, I get a notification about every 15 minutes.  It's painful.

Works but buggy It took at least 10 attempts to lock my house and in that amount of time I managed to miss a bus that was 5 minutes away when the bus stop was only 2 minutes away. Not impressed Kevo.

Pure garbage! app was able to connect during set up, but is incapable of doing anything it's designed to after that. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY! FIND A BETTER SMART LOCK WITH A BETTER APP!!

Works,  but not android friendly. Setting up on my note4 was a breeze.   Sending a key to my wife (who has a nexus) defaults to the iTunes store,  not the play store... With a vicious circle tied to the invite.   No way to select the play store... Come on!

Works on nexus 6 - not see app for S4 Sent a key to individual with a S4. A search in the play store on her phone doesn't show the kevo app. I shared the kevo app from my phone, nexus 6, still no luck. What version of Android is required to run the kevo app?..... Just read on the support site that S4 is not supported. Is that a hardware issue or os issue? Either way will have to downgrade my rating because of limited support for android and will have to return the product.... Just tried to send a key. It failed... Grrrrrrrrrr

So bad Range is horrible on lock never sees my phone in pocket. Don't waste your money on kevo plus it can't be placed between two locks and is the slowest process to use. Android wear app is a pos constantly crashing and white screens my watches overnight so I wake up to dead batteries off of the charger fix your garbage software

Unable to update lock. Just installed and went through setup. App indicated I need to update the lock and tried a handful of times. Either nothing happened or I got a message to retry. Will restart app later and try again (this is on a Nexus 6). Otherwise, looks good.

Worst app ever! Have downloaded over 500 apps through years, had mobile phones since Motorola Star Tech. Unable to even register. Keeps stating email I've had for years is invalid. Use Kwikset as builder, after waiting for app on my Note Edge very disappointed with Kwikset!!

Really love my new locks and even more happy with the changes Kevo has made over the last year. The app is leaps and bounds better, I find that my locks pair and open in a couple seconds when I tap them. My only reason not to give 5 stars is because on my Pixel with Android Oreo I have a constant notice that Kevo is running in the background (because it has to in order to function properly). I wonder if there is a way for the app developers or me to disable that notice? Would also be great to have an app for Samsung Gear but that's more of an issue since it runs Taizen and not Android...

Breaks with every android update - only works when app is open or I actually slide to look at the "Kevo is ready" notification. It's working again, but wish they'd be a little more on top of things with the updates.

Lock out! Watch out for Kevo not responding to phone and being locked out. The app was indicating lock was open when it wasn't actually unlocking the door! Fortunately I had spare key in car to manually open.

Love this lock so far i am using iphone 7 plus and Samsung edge 7 plus, love the  concept works similar to my jeep.  No keys to fumble for,  i did have to reset the lock once with my phones , but it's working fine. Advice still carry key with you must in case

They're getting better! The customer support is extremely slow, and not very helpful at times, but the warranty is handled well, I had to have mine replaced twice, didn't cost me a single penny... (once it was even my fault, I ripped some wires off the curcuit board accidentally! ). One cool feature is the re-key, which lets u use ur current or existing door key assuming its the same brand as your kevo (mine is by kwikset). This also works if you have multiple doors, no matter how many, one key does the job for all of them
