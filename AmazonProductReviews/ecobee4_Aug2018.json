{"Author": "PublicPersona", "Date": "on August 29, 2018", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great Thermostat. Lousy Alexa.", "Text": "The Ecobee4 has been thoroughly reviewed, so I'm not going to go into all the great features of this thermostat. I like it and would buy again, and will likely get an Ecobee3 Lite for another zone in my house. I did have the occasion to call their customer service, and got right through and the matter was handled fairly well. Now, the things that are annoying:\n\n1) If you already have Alexa devices, you'll be disappointed in this one. I can be five feet away from the Ecobee4 talking directly at it and two other Alexas in other parts of the house will hear me before this thing will. You really do have to stand fairly close and speak very clearly for it to work.\n2) Issue #1 is compounded by the problem that you cannot change the wake word! I want to do this so that I can talk specifically to this device without devices in other parts of the house answering, but you can't. Sure, I could change the wake word on every other device but I don't want to.\n3) Installation is fairly easy in a way, but gets confusing because there are three different sources of information while you proceed with the install - there is the instruction booklet, and there are instructions in the app, and then the thermostat itself provides guidance. I found myself going back and forth a lot. And some things would be better disassociated with the actual thermostat install. That is, let me create my Ecobee account on the web before the install. And let me deal with linking with Alexa, etc. after the install and not do that from the thermostat itself.\n4) During the install, it asked me if I have a furnace or a boiler. You have to choose one or the other. It's a heat pump, so neither of those apply (hint: select furnace if you have a heat pump).\n5) You can have any color you want, as long as it is black."}

You can stand right next to it, try to communicate a request, and it will not register or respond. Only in the middle of an ordinary household conversation will it suddenly assume you\u2019ve requested it to play a random song. Seriously, out of the blue. We tried turning on \u201cdo not disturb\u201d times to stretch out all day. That was useless. Is that feature even remotely functional? Simple solution is to turn off the mic, right? Well, get used to a big bright red light that won\u2019t go away until you relent. We are scrapping this as a total loss and upgrading to its smaller and smarter competitor this coming Christmas."}

I was drawn in due to the thermostat-Alexa combo. But it lacks many features a stand alone Alexa device has (I can\u2019t listen to my Spotify or Sirius account on it like I can through my other devices). Also the microphone will randomly turn on if it thinks it hears anything close to \u2018Alexa\u2019 and the microphone cannot hear you if there is a lot of background noise. I\u2019m sure my neighbors heard me yelling \u201cALEXA!\u201d many times before the device did. I have a split level house with an open concept living room/kitchen and you can hear the speakers fairly well around the house. I do like that you can control the thermostat through the ecobee app from an Alexa device in a different room. This thermostat just doesn\u2019t seem as user friendly as I heard the Nest is. (I was actually told by an HVAC service guy that their company stopped servicing Ecobee and recommend Nest. I do have to say that the Ecobee customer service seems very responsive and willing to help if there are issues. The service guy was on the phone with them for about an hour because the thermostat was showing strange electrical issues that turned out to be a wiring problem in the wall. With that said, I would not recommend hooking it up yourself unless you have some experience and know how to troubleshoot if things don\u2019t go smoothly.) If you like technology and diving into the settings functions to set up features like geotracking or motion tracking that work for your lifestyle, then this may be a thermostat to consider to help you save money on heating/cooling costs. I am hoping that future software upgrades will improve the Ecobee"}

Thus far I\u2019m not overly impressed. This thing is very poorly integrated with Alexa. When asking Alexa to control the device, you must be EXTREMELY specific. Out of frustration I went to The Ecobee Skill only to discover I had to ask Alexa to ask Ecobee to perform some action. And even after that, if I don\u2019t phrase it as specifically as they have it listed in the \u201cskill\u201d description, it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSecondly, this device is labeled as having Alexa built in but 1/2 the time it refuses to control any of my other devices. Constantly gives me an error message when I tell it to turn on the lights ... nope it can\u2019t do that! Yet I tell my Echo the EXACT same thing and it functions beautifully. Specifically it states \u201caudio actions & routines are not supported on this device\u201d. If it can\u2019t support those functions, why even have Alexa on it?!\n\nMicrophone is way to sensitive. Keeps overriding my Echo in the living room. As the two devices are so close to each other, I tried turning off the microphone, the light on the device becomes a very annoying constant RED."}

Things like comparing the efficiency of your home to your peers almost never updates and indicates that your report is in progress but it never updates. We then began to experience issues with the thermostat reseting to a different temperature randomly. Finally about two weeks ago, the system died. I called Ecobee support and they diagnosed the thermostat has failed and approved a replacement. That was 9 days ago. I still don't have a replacement, and they have yet to provide me tracking. I think the thermostat works ok. The Alexa integration is gimike; however, if this is the type of support that you receive when something goes wrong, I would go with Nest."}

I have had my upstairs thermostat set on 84 degrees on the cool setting and the temperature has gone as low as 75. I had to cut it off to get it to stop running the AC.

I chose those based on the \"break-out\" equipment boards with solid state relays. As time moved forward, these styles of boards did not integrate very well with the latest smart home initiatives - although they worked fine. In my current house, I decided to go with ecobee yet again, only upgrade to their latest product.\n\nWhy ecobee and not Nest or Iris or \"insert newcomer here\"...\nPrimarily, I am looking for something platform independent. Almost another branded thermostat owes its life to a big name brand - like Google, Apple, Amazon, etc...\n\nAs you begin to expand your platform or as these larger companies buy up the competitors. You may find your smart home configuration no longer works. (Just ask owners of SmartThings and Blink when Amazon came along).\n\nSo, true, Alexa is a selling point and that is Amazon, but ecobee also integrates with many other platforms - you don't have to use Alexa if you don't want. This is key for me.\n\nOne top of that, ecobee has been in the Smart Stat space for a VERY long time - much longer than Nest. They have worked through many of the challenges and have perfected the installation and operation of their thermostats.\n\nInstallation is well documented and easily performed - with wiring display in the stat itself as well as a test mode to validate your install.\n\nSure, the advanced options can be intimidating, but they are easy to configure and give you greater flexibility for your equipment, location, and control needs.\n\nMy ecobee(s) are rock solid and, aside from an occasional wifi loss (which only required a reconnect - which never impacted the A/C operation) they are an excellent product."}

{"Author": "MJ AF", "Date": "on August 9, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great Sales Pitch, Poor Follow-Through", "Text": "The ecobee4 is pitched as a great smart thermostat that is easy to install and use. Their sales pitch is great, but in actual practice I\u2019ve found that they hardware itself falls short.\nI bought this right as it came out and chose an Ecobee over a nest for two main reasons: 1) Ecobee has room sensors to help keep the rooms we\u2019re actually using comfortable rather than just where the unit is; 2) it has built in Alexa and a speaker.\nSince I\u2019ve had it I\u2019ve experienced 3 major issues.\nFirst, the instillation is not simple. I installed it as directed and everything looked great, except in the winter the AC kept turning on even though the Ecobee claimed it wasn\u2019t running. Turns out their instructions were not correct. It probably cost me a couple hundred in AC and gas bills as the two systems fought each other over the winter before I figured it out in the spring when I was actually outside next to the AC unit and heard it go off when it the Ecobee claimed no equipment was running. Got an HVAC guy to fix it without a problem and said that the Ecobee instructions are nearly always wrong. Since then the equipment is all running correctly\nSecond, with over a year of promises to update it, the only word you can use to activate Alexa is \u201cAlexa\u201d. To some this may seem stupid to complain about, but I have a child with a very similar name that causes the Ecobee to trigger constantly. I knew this was a potential issue since multiple reviews prior to the device coming out claimed that this was a drawback since other devices (echo for example) were able to have the wake word changed. However, Ecobee\u2019s company reps contacted the reviewers promising this was one of the first updates that would be made and it was in the works. The reviewers all revised their reviews based on this. We\u2019ve already seen the first update and no fix, and scouring the internet shows that it is now not a priority and I would not be surprised if it takes years to actually happen. You also can\u2019t use all the functionality of every app through ecobee\u2019s version of Alexa. The Alexa in the Ecobee4 is without a doubt a lower quality.\nThird, the speaker quality is pretty crappy. Now, I know this is a thermostat and not a speaker system but I expect the sound quality to be decent even if it doesn\u2019t allow it to get particularly loud. I can\u2019t even let it play a song at half volume without it getting a good deal of distortion. It just feels like they cheaped out there.\nOverall I\u2019m still happy with the Ecobee4. However, now that Nest has room sensors I don\u2019t think that the Ecobee has an advantage. Down a star for charging me more for an Alexa device that isn\u2019t what it claims and the related \u201ccreative marketing\u201d since it\u2019s probably not false advertising. Down another \u00bd star for low quality speaker. Finally, down \u00bd star for deceptive/incorrect installation instructions. 3 stars and I would not currently recommend to a friend instead I\u2019d have them get a Nest and an Echo. If they fix Alexa and their installation instructions I'd give it 4/4.5 stars and recommend it as a cheaper alternative to Nest."}

{"Author": "meep", "Date": "on August 6, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Lots of tech, but sensors are of limited use", "Text": "I purchased my ecobee through a local store in case I needed a quick exchange or return. I\u2019d reached out to ecobee ahead of time and their tech support did not give me confidence that the ecobee would support all of the functions of my 2 stage carrier heat pump. Tech support said it would, but when I asked specific questions, or questioned an answer they provided, the next person to respond would ignore it, or blow it off, or otherwise leave it unsolved. As it turns out, I was right- not all of the features of my heat pump are supported, namely the dehumidify feature; I think I\u2019ve got the rest working.\n\nWe needed a replacement tstat because the original was giving false readings and short cycling as a result. We chose the ecobee over the nest because of greater settings control with the \u2018bee and complaints in reviews and from a friend that the nest tries so hard to save energy that it\u2019s rather poor at job #1, maintaining a set temperature.\n\nFollowing the instructions, installation was fine. Everything was explained except for dehumidifier wiring, which, again, is integral to my heat pump- it commands the compressor to run with a lower fan speed to dry the air. With my system set up properly, it doesn\u2019t need it here so I can accept the loss of this function. Ecobee also states this will not support a variable speed system; mine works but I believe it\u2019s because the control board is setting fan speed based on the compressor commands, not the fan (green wire) command. (Thank you carrier, that was good planning).\n\nWhere the ecobee excels is customization. I can set up simple, or complex schedules based on our habits here. The website has a really good interface for building schedules, and the tstat menu is as good as it can be for such a small space. The menus are well thought out. As a stand alone unit, it works well.\n\nWhat we really wanted, however was use of the sensors to address certain problem areas at specific times of day. Our house really should have multiple systems but instead relies on a big single heat pump. Simply put, the sensors are slow to react to changes in temperature and then only poll ever so often. So, if the house was in away mode, and then cranks the AC when we get home, it would be 3 or more degrees too cold because the sensors are still cooling down while the rest of the air is good and fine. Another shortcoming I discovered is, if you\u2019ve put a sensor in a room that doesn\u2019t cool well, asking the system to cool it isn\u2019t much help, because the room doesn\u2019t cool well to begin with. So, for the room to cool down, the rest of the house is way too cold. While this isn\u2019t ecobee fault, it does show that ecobee can\u2019t fix it, but we all expect that it will because that\u2019s what they say it will.\n\nEcobee has a huge opportunity with the sensors that they do not use, however, and that would be to trigger the circulation fan to \u201con\u201d from \u201cauto\u201d when big temperature differences were detected between sensors. Say one room is 73 and the other is 67. You don\u2019t want to run the compressor, as that 67 room is already too cold, but you could run the fan to redistribute the air to even it out. This is the main reason even $20 stats have auto/on; how this escaped them idk. That said, I bought, and returned, the optional sensors because I don\u2019t see the payoff. They can\u2019t correct a deficiency in the house, they instead basically overcompensate, by swinging the internal temps wide based on which sensor has priority. Example, we tried one in the kitchen. Fire up the oven, and the kitchen will still stay warm, and now the living room is unbearably cold. Yet, put a cheap fan on the table and the temps remain even as the AC kicks in. Again, not ecobees fault, but also, not something ecobee can fix with remote sensors either.\n\nI\u2019m keeping the primary \u2018bee. It works with the carrier unit and is doing a great job at maintaining temps. The programmability is excellent, and it doesn\u2019t have physical buttons to wear out or a board behind it to fatigue. It seems to use solid state switching instead of relays, which also wear out; it\u2019s a good thermostat. However, with the disappointment of the sensor implementation I can\u2019t give it a great rating."}

I suppose it's possible mine is simply defective, but it's hardly more useful than a brick and significantly less effective than a traditional electric thermostat. The home/away feature does not work at all, the room detection features are spotty at best, it has some smart assist feature designed to adjust the temperature preemptively, but it doesn't work and instead way overshoots your desired temperature.

With that said... I believe what ecobee does well is to remotely monitor several thermostats, however what they fail at is incorporating the Amazon Echo into their unit. I'll have to ask Alexa to turn off a set of lights 2 or 3 times before it responds. Many times it just sits there, then quits. Whats really frustrating is asking Alexa to turn off a set of lights, for night time, only to have all of my light turned on. I then would need to walk around and turn off whatever lights the ecobee decided to turn on. It would be easier in the beginning to say \"Alexa, I'm getting up to turn off my lights\". Another frustration is having to ask Alexa to ask ecobee to change the temperature. What can I not say \"Alexa, temperature 70\u00ba\"? This review is only for this specific model of ecobee4. My Echo, and multiple Echo Dots work nearly flawlessly. I would not purchase this item again, and am really considering switching thermostats."}

I just upgraded 4 thermostats in my current home to Ecobee 4's. The thermostat is fine with some caveats. The change in the way they support, or no longer support, their customers is not.\n\nTHE GOOD\nTheir desktop monitoring is as good as ever. The phone app the 4 uses is a bit complex. If you have more than one house, you can group them so they both appear on the same app. However the app for the Ecobee3 is different, so I'm not sure if those work as well with the Ecobee 4 app. If I stay with Ecobee I may try to set up two different accounts and use the different apps.\n\nThe Sensors are a super idea. They don't always work correctly, and can say there is no one in the room when you are sleeping, but most of the time they work very well. It comes with one and you have the option to install 2nd with each thermostat.\n\nThe idea of an Alexa tie-in is great. Call out to it and you can change the temperature in the middle of the night without getting up. However the sound quality is tinny - nowhere as good as from a Dot, and it seems to start by itself some times. I'll be sitting watching TV and see the light on the Ecobee come on telling me it wants to communicate. If you put it in a room where you have an Amazon Echo, with its great sound quality, then the Ecobee answers at the same time the Echo.\n\nBoth an Energy Auditor and a HVAC contractor told me they like the Ecobee and Building 36 the best of the wi-fi enabled thermostats. The HVAC guy told me they have a lot of problems with NEST but love the Ecobee. They also love the Honeywell.\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD:\n\nWe have been unable to get one of the Ecobee 4's to work. It seems to conflict with another Ecobee 4. If I get #1 working, #2 stops working and vice versa. No on has been able to resolve it so far.\n\nThe two reasons I gave the system I used to love 3 stars:\n1. My AC died, so I have to upgrade my HVAC system (if a can ever find a contractor who is not booked 3 months out). A number of the new systems requireyou use their own wi-fi thermostat. So I may end up having to toss the Ecobee 4's. I've read up on it extensively and on some new AC systems, you can use the Ecobee 4 but it reduces the functionality of the system. So if you think a new HVAC system is in your future, chose the system before the Ecobee 4 and be sure it is compatible.\n\n2. When my AC went out the first thing I did was to contact Ecobee. Having just invested in four Ecobee 4's I wanted to be sure the new system would work with them. So I wanted the name of local contractors who were trained in the Ecobee. They would know which systems were fully compatible with the Ecobee 4. I clicked on the \"Find a Pro\" at Ecobee's website and was surprised to not see a list of contractors for my zip code, as you do at most HVAC sites. Instead I had to fill out a form and wait for someone to contact me. I was sure I would hear right back since over the years the customer service from this Canadian company had been superior. When I had not heard back five stiflingly hot days later, I called and got a hard to understand woman with a very heavy Indian accent, indicating that they were outsourcing and I might not get the level of support Ecobee used to provide. She told me that the list of local contractors were handled by a separate unit that was in another time zone and were closed. Since I called at noon eastern time, I gathered it was probably also outsourced to India. She said she could not help me, but I should hear in several days. when I pressed her, she said they were not allowed to give out that information. Considering the hot weather and lack of response, I was not a happy camper. Two days later who should call me but HOME ADVISORS!!! Ecobee has outsourced to them!!!. Home Advisorscharges its contractors as much as $50 for a lead. Beside the cost, which would of course be passed along to me, I live in an area where there is a real shortage of contractors. You are lucky if one returns your call, and really lucky if one actually turns up. They are all overbooked and overworked. I wanted to get a new system ASAP and have the option to contact them myself IMMEDIATELY. By teaming up with Home Advisors, Ecobee was taking that option away from me. I might also be contacted by some of the worthless contractors I have learned not to do business with, or ones I knew would never show up when they said they would. I am happy for Ecobee that they have so much business that they find it no longer viable to support their customers, but very disappointed they took this approach.\n\nI will post an update once I get my new HVAC installed advising if the Ecobee 4's will work with it or if I have to try to resell them. But Ecobee as a company has lost its glow for me."}

The real reason for the 4 not 5 star rating is the mounting. Nest started this round (mis-shaped) marketing war and ecobee followed. Virtually all standard stats are candy bar retangle shaped - and although the back plate ecobee has with the kit will cover up the old holes, they failed to think about mounting on a non-drywall common electrical plaster mud ring (common in new construction for the last 25 years in North America). These are used so the drywallers don't box in the thermostat cable.by accident. The only mounts are plastic anchors for drywall or hard plaster. The ecobee has only two exact places for mounting screws. One must penetrate the metal cover just above the mud lip (so you have to drill the metal) but there is nothing to screw the delecate white screews into. The second screw is inside the retangular holed of the mud ring. Ecobee fails to provide plastic wings pelredrilled to be used for mounting on to these mud rings. That fantastic customer service guy at the 800 number did accept to forward my drawing of wings they should provide, so I drafted it and emailed it back. Perhaps it will be a 5 star one day. For now, mounting it on a common single gang electrical mud ring takes fabricating wing parts yourself. I am very intuitive and handy yet this was a bit of a PITA.

When running the AC, I have about a +2 or 3 degree temp differential, even after closing my downstairs registers. Love the differential in the winter (cooler in the upstairs bedrooms even with wide open registers), but not in the summer. The main floor is like an ice box when you get the upstairs cooled to the desired temp. If you are looking to use the remote sensor, you need to have a well balanced HVAC system to maximize this setup."}

So a little background about me I have a BS in networking and information systems and network+ and Cisco certified. I was a Nest owner for 4 years.\n\nSo I wanted to upgrade from my Nest to an Ecobee mostly for their Homekit integration and their seemingly willingness to innovate with their products. I installed my Ecobee in the exact same spot as I did my Nest and I have had nothing but problems with it sense. It disconnects from the network multiple times per day. First off this thermostat is only 20\u2019 away from the AP so the signal is great. Keep in mind in the 4 years of having the Nest I never had 1 disconnect. So I did a quick google search and I see that there is a firmware issue and it needs updated.\n\nWell you are not able to do the update yourself. So I sent off the email to their support department and 2-3 days later they responded with they have done the update. Why they can\u2019t do the update through their app is just crazy in my mind or it needs to just update on its own all the time.\n\nWell my connection problems didn\u2019t go away. So I contacted their support department again. Took them about a week to respond and they had me change the channel that my WiFi was working on to 1. Not quite sure their reasoning for this is. There are a few other WiFi AP in the area one of which is on channel 1 and this tends to lead to more connection problems. But hey I did it anyways. They also closed the ticket less then 24 hrs after they asked me to change the channel.\n\nWell this did not fix the WiFi issues it actually made it worse. I now loose my connection 2-3x more each day. So I reopen the support ticket and 3 days later they ask what is the signal strength? I so I responded with with its percentage and that\u2019s where contact stops. I went over a week without any response. So I sent another email told them that I had a Nest in this very location without any connection issues and that they need to figure out why mine was. Their response was pretty unprofessional in my mind. They came back with off you google Nest and WiFi issues you will find plenty of cases where they have connection issues as well. You are only disconnecting from the network 6 or so times per day....\n\nWell here\u2019s the thing. Ecobee does not auto reconnect. You have to go through the network setup process all over each time. None of the homekit features can work when discounted from WiFi since it needs WiFi to work. So that makes all the smart features useless. Needless to say I wish I kept the box as I would be returning this and going back to my Nest. I only wish Nest would support Homekit."}

{"Author": "J. Wilson", "Date": "on May 29, 2018", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "1 Year with the Ecobee 4. A bumpy ride.", "Text": "I, as I'm sure many folks do, went back and forth over purchasing an Ecobee or a Nest. 12 months later, I'm still not sure I made the right choice.\n\nThe remote sensors were a major tipping point in my decision, however, you have to know what you are getting into. The sensors are useful, true, but take some getting used to figuring out how they work and effect the function of the thermostat. Your thermostat will treat the average of all active sensors as the overall temperature that it will react to. You can set whether each sensor participates in a particular 'comfort setting' / schedule and will be included in the average. Of course the sensors only contribute to the average when they have recently detected motion, or when none of them show 'occupied'.\n\nThis sounds good, but in effect it means number of sensors and their placement become very important. The fewer sensors, the more a single sensor can swing the 'average'. I quickly found I needed more sensors to have any sort of balance and effective heating / cooling in the house. So, if comparing the price of this thermostat with others, keep in mind you will probably end up buying more sensors, which are frankly, overpriced. Only available in 2 packs, that average $60 or more, when the sensors should really be $20 each at most. And regardless of seasonal promotions that regularly offer the thermostats on sale, I've yet to see extra sensors offered on sale.\n\nI expected the thermostat to be smarter, really. Once sensors were set up, smart home / away, geofencing, etc etc. I thought it would be set it and forget it. But ended up spending the first few months bumping temperature settings up or down, adjusting schedules, tweaking settings. So right away was wondering if I should have gotten the Nest instead, since it's whole thing is that it gets trained by those changes, and figures out your comfort settings for you. Instead, we were constantly making those tweaks and corrections, and the thermostat was learning nothing.\n\nI was excited about the usage reports, the data and feedback on our usage and savings. So, after installing the thermostat on June 2, 2017. I was thoroughly disappointed to find that after 30 days, I had no data. Then to realize it required a complete 'Calendar' month of usage to get any data. So all my June usage was tossed, I had to wait through July, and then another week or two into August before any reports showed up. After all that wait, I found the reports were basically useless fluff that just stated our usage vs. if we had the thermostat set at a different temperature. Yes, we saved energy vs if we'd had the AC cranked up all the time. Okay thanks.\n\nThe data was also skewed, as within the first month or so of ownership I realized that the outside temperature reading on the thermostat (taken from internet weather reporting) was wayyyyy off. Tracking it for a bit, I realized that it was lagging about 3 hours behind. So of course any 'learning' the thermostat was doing about inside temp and heat pump usage vs the outside temp was all wrong. Contacting support, they just suggested I change weather stations, even though the entire list of 10 local stations they sent me showed temperatures that were 3 hours off. Had this problem come and go for some months, pretty sure I ended up on a weather station that's about 15 miles away, not optimal, but apparently more stable than the closer ones. I haven't noticed problems in a while, though I stopped paying much attention to the data reports after realizing their relative uselessness. So maybe their weather service got their act together, maybe not.\n\nBut, the biggest problem came at 11 months in, when I walked by my thermostat one evening and noticed the 'Setup' screen was showing. After 11 months of tweaking settings and schedules, figuring out heat pump compressor / emergency heat limits and thresholds over the winter when it kept swinging between really cold house and overly using the expensive resistant heating element... all of my settings were gone. Are gone I should say.\nAfter weeks and weeks of long silences from support, tickets being closed and re-opened, 'our team is looking into it', etc. Not surprisingly the final answer was 'there's nothing in our logs to indicate what happened'. No answer, no reassurance that this sort of thing might not just happen again at any time. No backups of settings, etc.\n\nSo, 12 months later I'm back to square one. No sensors, no custom settings, no heat pump thresholds tweaked to perfection, nothing. Just an expensive thermostat that's not very smart, and a handful of overpriced sensors that don't want to re-associate it with it. Awesome.\n\nNot having used the Nest, I can't say for sure that it's better, I can only say the Ecobee has been less that awesome. When I get it all set back up I will definitely be writing down all the settings as I go, now that I know they can be lost completely at any time. Despite having an online account and the company surely collecting data from all our thermostats all the time for their own use, none of that data is really of any use to the customer when we need it.\n\nAlso, I didn't buy the Ecobee for Alexa. We used it some initially, found it more amusing than useful, but in the end Google Home won our hearts and we've since filled our house with that particular assistant. So another knock against the Ecobee4 is that if you decide to disable Alexa from listening to you all the time, your thermostat then has a permanent red glowing bar across the top of it. Supposedly a better solution is being worked on, but has never materialized.\n\nI'm still hoping that the Ecobee will eventually redeem itself when I get further into my smart home / home automation adventure. I haven't checked recently, but at the time of purchase, the Ecobee had a much more robust API open to users, allowing the more robust smart home hub / controllers like openHab to get data from the sensors and thermostat, and possibly trigger various actions on the thermostat. If this ends up working as I hope, it may all be worth it. Of course, if I just end up using it as a networked thermostat that's controlled by a smart controller based on various other (lower priced) sensors throughout the house, well, there's probably cheaper thermostats that allow that sort of external triggering. But hey, they probably don't look as nice!"}

They've made it so my Echo ecosystem is virtually unusable. To top it off, I can't seem to get the existing Alexa enabled devices to control the Ecobee, and unless I'm standing right next to Ecobee and talking in hushed tones, I can't talk to the thermostat without talking to my Echo as well. Very shabby integration and I can't imagine they tested this in a real environment to see how users would work with this device when they already have some of the technology that comes onboard (which I have to imagine is a fair overlap on the adoption curve of connected devices...)"}

To answer which one it the best or is better, I don't thing there is a right answer. I went with the Ecobee brand because I recently bought an Eco show devise and I really liked the Alexa system and wanted to try and keep everything compatible. I am slowly trying to convert my home into a smart home. My thermostat was the next step. I hired a professional to do the install, but they kept calling to reschedule and I kept getting frustrated so I decided to do it myself. I did the prior thermostat myself, a normal digital (non-smart) Honeywell thermostat. which worked, but took me a long time and was a pain in the but to install. I am not a home improvement kind of guy and am not really handy with tools, yet I still found it very easy to install with the instructions provided. It took me only 15 minutes to install. Once I turned the power on, the ecobee unit automatically walks you through a trouble shooting tutorial to ensure you have the proper wires connected to the proper terminals and your thermostat set to the proper setting in order not to damage your ac/furnace. The ecobee App you need to download and I found it very easy to use. I can't compare it to other Smart Thermostats, but I can say it was extremely easy to install by any nonprofessional, is very easy to use, I love the cell phone capability, and having Alexa. Do not waste your money on the smart sensors unless you have a multiple story home that requires more than 1 AC/Furnace. These sensors do not turn your home into a multiple zone heated/cool house. That function will only work if your house is already a multi zone home with multiple ac/furnace units to toggle amongst. What it will do will crank up our down the heat or ac based on a specific room you have a sensor in. Say you have a back bedroom that just doesn't get as cool as the rest so you set a sensor in there and want the ecobee to read and adjust to that room. Great it will, but it can't close off the other rooms, that will be freezing to accommodate the extra drop in temp the thermostat adjusted to meet that room demand."}

The extra sensors are a must have.. you spread them all around the house and the Ecobee takes an avg of the sensors to determine the temp of your home.. it also runs just the fan to move around the air to even out hot and cold spots that the sensors pick up.. I installed the Ecobee4 downstairs.. it has Alexa built into it (still not sure how I feel about some creepy AI always listening)... It shows the weather, can play music, connect it to your phone to use as a hands free device, and you can also ask Alexa an infinate range of questions (she has the entire internet at her disposal so her answer has got to be true.... right)... I installed the Ecobee3 upstairs because it doesn't have all the extra bells and whistles (Alexa(creepy AI)).. but other than that functions the exact same...

Instead of my home heat having spikes, the system stops when the average of sensors is met. It is awesome. Example: I set at 72 deg and my past system would hit 76 deg. Now the ecobee at worst goes up only 1 deg vs 5-8 deg delta.\n\nThe \"Alexa\" beneif is a HUGE plus.

Don't bother until you've researched. My Nest took 20 minutes to install. This one has sapped four hours of my life. The nice thing about the Nest is it has a battery negating the necessity of a C wire thus making it a much more versatile choice for a smart Thermostat. The Ecobee REQUIRES the C wire because it has no battery to keep it charged. If you don't have a C wire, and you aren't an HVAC specialist, you could probably hire someone local to install it for you. Many HVAC places carry Ecobee thermostats.\n\nAfter trying to add the PEK module to my furnace, we were missing the Y wire. I called support and pretty much cut him off when it sounded like he wanted me to figure out where a wire went throughout the walls in my house. So the other stories about their customer service having people walk around in crawl spaces sounds about right. Their CS was also sort of rude in the way they talked over you when you were trying to explain something.\n\nFortunately after I hung up with customer service, I noticed that I DID have a C-wire. I had a stray blue wire just hanging out of the thermostat wire bundle and wasn't connected to the furnace, and I had to fish it out of the wall from behind the thermostat and connect it. So fortunately it was a happy ending, but if I had known it was going to be this much of a pain, I'd just have stuck with my Nest.\n\nSo far the thermostat is okay. Setting the temperature isn't as easy as turning the outside of the thermostat, but I do like the sensor that I can put in our smaller bedroom at night so that it prioritizes the temperature in the room before the living room where the thermostat is installed. In that way, it's a smarter smart thermostat."}

They made them sound so configurable, and being in IT, and someone who loves to tinker and get into the guts of electronic devices, I looked forward to installing one, but have to admit to this being a real letdown.\n\nI purchased this thermostat directly from ComEd because of the instant rebate, but I have to say if i purchased it elsewhere for full price, I may have returned it. I can only assume all the glowing reviews by the big tech review websites are being paid for them, because although this device does do some handy things, it totally falls down on most of the so-called \"smart\" features that are advertised:\n\n\"SMART\" Recovery: This feature is an utter joke. It is supposed to learn over time how long it takes to wam or cool your house back to the desired temperature, but never does. Instead, it starts heating or cooling about 2 to 3 hours before the set time and just runs and runs unnecessarily. Sure, you have all these options to enter like the sq, ft. of your home, number of bedrooms, etc. LOL. Setting them do as much good as pushing the \"close door\" button in an elevator, and I'm convinced they are added to give the illusion of the feature actually working and using them. This is a simple calculation. It should not take more than 2 or 3 days to zero in, and it can't. The programmers could fix it in 20 minutes. Why don't they? Epic fail.\n\n\"SMART\" Home/Away: This is supposed to override your schedule for HOME if the sensors detect no motion, and AWAY if they do. The only problem is, they have hard coded absurd delays into the unit, which again, instead of save energy, consume more! Leave the house with the schedule set to away after the sensors saw you, and it won't alter until a full 2 HOURS after you left. So your heater or A/C just keeps chugging for nothing, totally ignoring the fact your schedule is set to AWAY. Plus it won't assume you're home when set to away for 30 minutes, so you can either freeze or sweat until it's convinced you're there. And like so many other areas, Ecobee will not give the user the ability to customize the settings to their liking. This thermostat is more like an IPhone rather than Android. They will decide the parameters and settings, and \"you will like it or too bad\" When I shell out hundreds for something, *I* want full control. Give us an \"Advanced\" mode, or stop saying your gadget is \"smart\" It's really not.\n\nI will say the remote temp sensor is nice, and I like that it is controlling my humidifier now so I don't have to worry about it, but other than that, for the selling price, I could buy 2 dozen digital thermostats that do 90% of what this does.\n\nI didn't buy it for that dumb Alexa crap, so I don't really care if that works or not."}

I find the \"smart\" features provide only marginal value above much less costly Wi-Fi connected thermostats, and certainly not worth double the price of a few of them.\n\nPros:\n-The Ecobee learns how long it takes to heat/cool your house, and preemptively starts heating/cooling to meet the desired temperature.\n-The room sensors are nice to help the Ecobee control the temperature for where you're at in the house. However, I've found this can also be a bit challenging with a two-story house and a single zone system as my upstairs will either be comfortable and the downstairs really cold (winter), or the downstairs comfortable and the upstairs way too warm. This is not entirely the fault of the Ecobee as there is only so much it can do with a single-zone system. What would be ideal is if it could remote open/close vents (these do exist) based on the corresponding room temperature to keep everything as even as possible.\n-I have not installed it yet, but I'm excited to connect it to my ventilator system for summer cooling so I can leave my AC on when I go to bed and the unit will automatically switch off the AC and switch over to pulling in outside air when the outside temperature drops enough. Frequently in the summer our temps get nice and and cool at night, but not until after we go to bed, so it's either leave the AC on or turn it off and the house heats up until later in the evening.\n-The app is simple to use\n\nCons:\n-Expensive, and limited value for the premium price over most other Wi-Fi enabled thermostats.\n-\"Smart\" features aren't really all that smart in my opinion. The smartest thing it does is sense when you're home or away outside of your normal schedule and adjust accordingly\n-Home IQ reports are buggy and of marginal value. First off, it took them almost three months for me to even get reports. Supposedly it needs one full calendar month of data before it can do reports, but it could get any reports until there were three full months of data. Once I did get the reports, I was woefully disappointed. They have some information that's cool like showing how you compare to your community (not sure how they define that). The \"savings\" are based off of benchmarks that have nothing to do with your prior operations, but rather just stacked against an arbitrary setting. For example, it claims I've saved $xx.xx since installation, but that's using a (heating) benchmark that's four degrees higher than I've ever set my thermostat to in the winter.\n-Temp change slider is not ideal to use. I've never used a Nest, but I can only imagine a dial would be much simpler to use than the virtual slider which is tricky to use - like to zoom past your desired temp and then you have to reverse until you get it right. A simple tap up and down would be more precise.\n-Alexa is marginal and buggy. I won't rehash all the reasons why Alexa isn't that great on here, but I will say that it's buggy. Ours randomly activated frequently until we ultimately unlinked it. We came home once to the unit playing music."}

But I will see in the Summer how it goes and will most likely buy two more sensors for my other two bedrooms not covered by sensors yet.\n\nI wish I had a fancy humidifier that I could control with this but I still have to go down to the basement to adjust the humidity levels.\n\nI honestly don't know if this thermostat has helped with my heating bill, but I replaced my a/c and furnace and had Aeroseal seal my ducts (they use a liquid sealant that is blown in and then hardens into basically a caulking material. I believe it can seal up to a 1/4\" gap and I was losing literally a ton of air or 35% per their computer and when they were done they got me down to only an 8% loss of air (issue in my basement) and it has made all the difference! I highly suggest this and for my 3200 sq ft. house it cost me $1850 through my HVAC contractor) and with the addition of the ecobee4, I have been saving at least $50 a month on my heat bill. No lie, I used to average $200+ a month in the winter or worse if it was a super cold month and lately I have barely been above $150 on electric and gas combined.\n\nGet one, I love mine!"}

{"Author": "Gary", "Date": "on March 3, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Worth Every Penny!", "Text": "After having several digital thermostats this was our first smart thermostat. We\u2019ve been using it now for two months and I can safely say it is worth every penny. The device is well made and easy to use. It\u2019s design compliments our older home while still providing modern touches. The iPhone app is simple and well maintained even supporting the new iPhone X.\n\nThe device itself is a thermometer and thermostat in one, but comes with a separate thermometer sensor to place in another room. We bought two other sensors so that we can cover our small four room house. The thermostat and sensors track where motion is and average out the temperatures to ensure the house is well heated.\n\nThough we have a new furnace with humidifier, we do not have dampers so the sensors only act as temp/motion sensors but this is still well worth it. At night when the house cools faster than the bedroom, the furnace knows not to turn the heater on until the average of all four roooms equals the set temp. This keeps our bedroom for heating far higher than the other rooms, which makes sleeping more pleasant. The main unit also tracks the humidity indoors and turns our humidifier on as needed.\n\nThe wall unit has a simple interface that shows the time, indoor temp, and outdoor local temp. The face is not overly busy or distracting like most thermostats. When you go near the thermostat it senses you and displays the settings menu. The menu mirrors the mobile app so it is easy to remember how to use.\n\nLong story short, if you are researching and unsure what smart thermostat to go with, I would sway you to try the Ecobee. I think you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised with your decision (we were)."}

We purchased this product because we wanted to use Alexa to automate our condo and our thermostat is right in the middle of our unit. I can literally stand three feet from this unit and address Alexa and my Dot twenty feet away will recognize me better than the Ecobee. Not sure why it doesn\u2019t pick up as well as the Dot but it just doesn\u2019t so the primary reason we purchased this is less than satisfactory. Now for some pointers for anyone installing one of these. I paid for the professional installation and the young man they sent out was professional, prompt and very nice. He hooked it all up but after he left I realized it was not recognizing heat. They came back immediately and rewired it and now I had a heat setting. Several days later I turned on the heat and while the unit blew it did not blow hot air. It was just the fan. Thinking it was not the unit, I had an AC company come out to check the unit. Unfortunately, the AC guy struggled with this. Not because its complex but because the wires from my unit were apparently convoluted. After an hour and a half of lamenting about it, I finally convinced him to just track the wires from the unit on the roof to the air handler to the thermostat and \u201cwe\u201d got it all working. Its not complicated if your wires are color coded correctly. Ours were not and therefore we had to track them through. If you have a newer house, I can\u2019t imagine this would be an issue. I will tell you to leave the wiring harness in the box. The Amazon installer used it and it just confused the AC guy. We removed it and just ran it through. I will give Ecobee support 5 stars. While the AC guy was there I got on a chat with them and they were exceptional. Very helpful and clear. I called them the next day because resetting everything killed Alexa. They walked me through resetting it very concisely and were great to work with. So while it took me much longer to actually get it installed than I expected, it does work now and I can control it remotely and through Alexa whether the thermostat itself, the Dot or my Alexa or Ecobee apps. I added some Meross plugs and now I can control everything worth controlling in my 1300 sf condo which is exactly where I wanted to be after downsizing from the 5000 sf McMansion. I can walk out the door and know everything is good for whenever I get back."}

{"Author": "JWINK", "Date": "on February 24, 2018", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Good smart thermostat", "Text": "I have three zones in the house (one on each floor) and unfortunately one thermostat can\u2019t control all the zones, so I needed three thermostats and I decided to this 4 along with 2 Ecobee3 lite thermostats. Because of the locations of my old thermostats in my home, only one location was well suited for the voice capability of the 4, so the Ecobee3\u2019s, I use for the other zones in the house.\n\nIncluded with the thermostat is the wiring backplate, power extender kit (PEK), installation screws/anchors, installation guide, wire labels, one room sensor, stand, and trim plate. The installation guide is actually very clearly written and easily understandable, making the actual installation easy to do. The installation manual only gives a brief (and I mean very brief) overview of the thermostats features. Even though there is a decent online user manual for the 3, oddly, there is no online user manual for the 4, other than several support articles. That is fine for the basic functions of the device as it is fairly similar to the 3, but Ecobee really should compile the support articles for the 4 into a good online manual, instead of users having to sort through various articles to find answers specific to the 4. The voice features and how to activate with Amazon is not very well documented either.\n\nThe three major differences with the 4 and the 3 lite (other than the 4 being slightly bigger and thicker), are the voice feature, included room sensor, is the ability to control other things such as dehumidifiers and ventilators. The 4 can control those and the 3 lite cannot. Both the 3 and 4 can use the sensors, but sensors have to be purchased separately for the 3 and of course there is no onboard Alexa control with the 3 lite, but both the 3 and 4\u2019s can be control by smart speakers, if you have one.\n\nInstallation is basically the same for both models of Ecobee. The install is pretty easy and took me about 20 to 30 minutes per thermostat. The install itself is quicker, but I had to fix the previous screw holes and paint the wall behind the previous thermostats because I didn\u2019t want to use the trim plate. The included instructions walk you through each install step with good illustrations.\n\nStart the install by shutting the breakers off for system (mine had a total of 3 breakers for the A/C and furnace) and removing the old thermostat and wires (taking a picture of the wires and labeling before removing is recommended). Depending on your system, you may need to use the PEK extender if you don\u2019t have a C wire. My system has the C wire and so I didn\u2019t use the extender. If you need to use the extender, the instructions are pretty clear and only adds a couple minutes to the install.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to fix the holes and paint the wall like I did, you can use the trim plate. I decided against using the trim plate as I think it detracted from the cool look of the thermostat and looked ugly on the wall with its basic white plastic look. To me, it is too large and stands out way too much. If the thermostat was larger, it might not be as noticeable, but with the current Ecobee size, I didn\u2019t like it the trim plate at all. For me, the small screw hole fix and small amount of painting was worth the work over using the trim plate.\n\nNext is the wiring plate which is installed with two wall anchors and screws. The anchors themselves are not particularly great quality and bend easily, so you have to be careful inserting them into the drill holes in the wall or they will bend. I replaced them with better quality anchors. The key to installing the wiring plate is making sure the plate is level. Ecobee smartly puts a bubble level on the wiring plate, making that easy to do.\n\nAfter that is a matter of matching the labeled wires to the slots on the wiring plate. I do wish the wire labels were a bit stickier as they tend to slide around and sometimes fall off the wires during install. I had a couple labels fall of during installation, but luckily not at the same time. The terminal blocks are not the easiest to insert the wires in place as it is hard to tell if they are locked in place sometimes. I think they need to improve the design of the wiring terminals to make them easier to use and easier to tell if they are locked in place. After the wires are connected, attach the thermostat to the wiring plate and turn on the breakers and proceed with the thermostat setup. I tested the first thermostat by powering up before I completed installing my other two thermostats.\n\nThe Ecobee walks you through the initial setup and like the install is pretty easy. I did have an initial glitch with the very first thermostat that I installed as it errored upon initial registration. It turns out that I should have registered my Ecobee account first instead of trying to do that at the same time when I registered the thermostat. If you don\u2019t you may get an error when trying to register a thermostat, like I did. A quick call to customer support quickly resolved the issue. I recommend setting up your Ecobee account first and getting the phone app prior to the thermostat power up to help make the setup painless.\n\nThe Ecobee4 includes the one sensor but I do plan to add more later. The sensor was very easy to install as you simply hold near the thermostat, pull the plastic battery tab and the thermostat automatically recognize it and asks to add it. The sensor is a simple square design with a logo and can be put on the wall or on the included stand. I do wish there was some low battery indicator on both the sensor and the app to tell you when the battery is low or dead as some time may pass before you notice it is time to change the battery. I think the added sensors are also a bit pricy at roughly 30 to 40 dollars each.\n\nI explored the various support articles, the Ecobee3 online manual as well as exploring the various settings to learn the features of the thermostat and the app. For the most part, the thermostat is fairly easy to understand and logically organized. I did have to look up some specific settings, such as how to connect to my google home speaker (it can also be connected to Alexa), which can control each of the thermostats and how to set up specific settings such as the reminders and sleep settings. The voice feature and connecting to Amazon should be better documented as I have looked up support articles for those things more than anything else, making setup for that feature less user friendly than it should be. I tried to connect this to my Honeywell Z-wave system, but it doesn\u2019t look like it is compatible as I didn\u2019t have any luck at doing so.\n\nThe thermostat looks cool on the wall. The touch screen is very responsive, with my only complaint being some of the icons and the keyboard being a bit smaller than I would like. You can change the temperature, view the current forecast, set schedules and adjust the settings. I set all three of my thermostats to automatically switch between heat and cool, which to me is beneficial for those times of the year that are in between the seasons. You can manually set to either heat or cool as well if you so choose.\n\nOne small thing with the thermostats is that when I set the reminder about changing the filters, I get an email saying that I last changed the filter in 2014, even though I set it to Feb 2018. I assume that is just a small bug because it defaults to 2014, when you first enable. I don\u2019t think it should send that email until after you adjust the date setting for the last filter change and save it, but the reminders page seems to lack a save feature though. An added save feature might solve that bug in the reminder area as that would only activate the reminder after hitting save would be an easy fix for that. Hopefully Ecobee will fix that in future updates.\n\nThe display is not overly bright and dims when not in use, automatically brightening when you walk near it. One thermostat is in my bedroom and I didn\u2019t notice it all when I was trying to sleep. The display is easy to read, even from across the room.\n\nOne thing I do wish this had was a learning feature like the Nest. I like the room sensor idea but without those, it really should have the ability to learn. It is programmable though and has pre-programmed settings for sleep, home and away along with geofence capabilities. I do think the schedule programming could be a bit easier and more feature rich than it is.\n\nThe Ecobee app is pretty similar in look and feel to the thermostats and online web portal, making navigation simpler to learn and use. I do wish they would allow you to add user logins for other individuals in the home instead of having to use the same login for each app user.\n\nSo far, I have had no network or connection issues with the thermostats, but that may depend on your network setup and range of your router. I use a Netgear R7000 AC router and an EX8000 extender so there are no dead spots in the home, so I usually don\u2019t have any connections issues with any device.\n\nThe one thing that I think is an issue with these thermostats is the lack of a rechargeable battery backup or ability to put batteries into the thermostat. If the power goes down, then the thermostat has to reboot again. I would prefer to at least have a AA battery slot for maintaining the thermostat\u2019s power in a low power state when the power goes out with the thermostat being able to send a signal to the app, letting you know in an emergency that there is no power to your heating/AC system.\n\nProbably, the biggest difference with the 4 versus the 3\u2019s is the Alexa voice capabilities. I think it is a pretty cool feature (although a pricey addition) for the thermostat. If I had better thermostat locations in the home, I would have gotten all Ecobee4\u2019s, just to get that capability. If you already have smart speakers though, you can pretty much do the same with the lower cost 3\u2019s. In this case, I got the 4 for my bedroom, so I can just shout out to the thermostat without having to move from the comfort of the bed. I can adjust temperature, get the weather forecast, play some trivia games, get a joke, and play music just by asking the thermostat to do so. I won\u2019t say this is as capable as a smart speaker as some voice features are limited and not as expansive on the thermostat versus a smart speaker and there are times it doesn\u2019t quite understand what you are asking. Some features are also limited to your Amazon account as well, depending on whether you have prime or prime music for example.\n\nPros:\nCool look\nResponsive, easy to see display\nSmart features\nAlexa voice capability to control thermostat, among other things\nAlexa microphone is pretty decent\nSpeaker is decent considering its size and location on thermostat\nAuto heat/cool feature\nGeofencing capability\nEnergy savings capabilities\nEasy to use app\nEasy to understand installation instructions/easy to install\nEasy to setup and use (see cons)\nWorks with Alexa, Google home\nAuto dim/auto detect feature\nWeather forecast feature\nPossible price rebates from power companies (depending on your location)\nWorks for most systems and system devices\nOne room sensor included\nESP now added as a feature (for those with several smart speakers)\nAlexa light can now be disabled (with latest firmware update)\nGood 3/5 Year warranty\n\nCons:\nExpensive (unless there are utility rebates available in your area)\nOne thermostat may be needed for each zone\nNo battery backup capability\nSome initial registration glitches possible\nSome Alexa features limited\nSome icons and keyboard a bit small\nNo learning features\nScheduling could be a bit better\nNo ability to add additional user login\u2019s for app\nWiring plate could be easier to install wires and lock them in place\nUgly large trim plate\nWall anchors aren\u2019t great quality\nWire labels fall off too easy during install\nSpeaker sound isn\u2019t as good as smart speakers\nExtra room sensors a bit expensive/sensors lack a low battery indicator\nNo user manual included in package\nNo online user manual documenting features, only various support articles\nSmall bug in reminder settings\nOuter case not as stylish as the metal ringed Nest thermostat\nNot Z-wave compatible\n\nI do think the thermostats are a bit expensive, but depending on the area you live, your local utility (like mine) might have a deal or rebate on these at nearly half off, making these a pretty good deal for one of the coolest and smartest thermostats out there.\n\n4 stars"}

We\u2019ve now had the device for a few months and can give it a thorough and honest review.\n\nBuild Quality\nOne thing to start off with is that this is a great looking thermostat. It doesn\u2019t have aluminum like a Nest but it still looks classy.\n\nDevice User Interface\nThe user interface on the device is simple to learn and fairly responsive. The screen isn\u2019t a high resolution screen but is still clear and fairly crisp. Touch input is responsive since the screen is a capacitive touch screen.\n\niOS App\nThe iOS app basically mirrors the device UI. It take a bit to connect to the device over Wifi when the app is launched which delays quick minor adjustments. The app could use some work. Luckily it\u2019s not needed since Alexa Voice Service & Siri work extremely well with this thermostat.\n\nVoice Control & Home Automation- Alexa Voice Service, Siri & Apple HomeKit\nThis is where the device shines. Our home has a lot of connected devices, a mixture of Apple HomeKit & Alexa being at the center of our home\u2019s ecosystem. This device is perfect for that since it plays with both systems. When I\u2019m near one of the few echo dots in our home, a simple command to Alexa will activate the thermostat, turn up the temp, turn it down, turn it off. If I\u2019m in an area where I don\u2019t have an echo dot, simple cannons to Siri on my Apple Watch or iPhone does the job. I can quickly get temperature readings of our kids room with a simple voice command with the room sensor by asking Alexa or Siri. The ease of controlling the thermostat via voice is really useful, especially if you have a medium/large home and the thermostat is inconveniently located.\n\nRoom Sensor\nThe room sensor is a great accessory. Our heating is a bit uneven on the upper floor (some rooms get hotter than others, we don\u2019t have zones setup and flaps have minimal distribution effect with our vents) so I have a remote room temperature sensor in our kids room and use that sensor for temperature automation in the evening time. We then have the ecobee use the main unit\u2019s sensor for temperature monitoring during the day time.\n\nOverall excellent product"}

However this last Monday it inexplicably stopped calling for my AC to turn on. If I restarted the unit it would call for the AC To turn on as soon it it booted up but would turn it off after about 2 minuets every time. If I bypassed the thermostat everyone would remain on. I reset the ecobee took it off the wall reinstalled the mounting plate and wires. No luck. Called support who asked for pics of the wiring which I sent and they confirmed the wiring was fine. Spent a hour on the phone troubleshooting and they finally reluctantly admitted it was a bad unit so they would replace it. They were unable the provide a timeframe for the replacement they said normally around 10 days which is unacceptable in South Texas to be without AC for that long. Went to best buy and bought a Nest. Took 10 min to install and works perfectly."}

When I do it says this device does not support that. One thing I'll say about Alexa is that it impressed me that it could hear me from all the way down the hall from either the kitchen or living room. The range is impressive. So anyway, Alexa aside, the thermostat works great and was easy to setup. I was worried about having to use the PEK since I was replacing an old honeywell unit, but luckily I had a wire that was not being used and got away with not installing the pek. The app that walks you through the setup is super convenient as well. Love that it works with home kit and so far I've had no issues using the app or any features."}

I have other ways of measuring temperature and they are wrong. I have 3 sensors they all show the same issue. Now they tell me that 4 degrees is normal - too bad. This is unacceptable as the difference between 67 and 71 is the difference between I want it hotter and I don't.\n#2 - Rebate promise. I was told about a significant SCE rebate and that was one of the reasons I purchased this. Guess what! After waiting past my return deadline I was told that I do not qualify for the SCE rebate because I am not part of a particular program. When I asked for more information about what the program was I got no more email responses.\n#3 - Tech support - I have waited well over an hour at a time on hold for someone to pick up their tech support on multiple occasions.

Therefore 2 degrees from the sensor and 2 degrees from the unit is ok. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told one would call me the next day. Over 2 weeks later I received an email reiterating that 4 degrees is normal. LOOK you have ONE JOB. Measure the temperature and make a change you you can't get the first part right. A 4 degree temperature difference is UNACCEPTABLE!!! I shouldn't have to recalibrate my life thinking that I'm cold at 72 when in fact the temperature is actually 68. This is a crappy product, service is terrible spending hours on hold waiting for tech support, you bait and switch by telling me I could get a large rebate only to tell me that I can't, and I have to stand in front of it and yell at it to get Alexa to work!\n\nTERRIBLE in ALL respects!"}

Our furnace is a Rheem \u201cContour Comfort\u201c, about ten years old, that can adjust its heat output in 10% steps between 40% and 100%. The ecobee4 does not have the modulation control output (we did not know that of course) but I found that I could reset a couple of switches in the furnace to make it work as a two stage unit. We gave the ecobee a very fair trial, trying some setting changes on advice from ecobee support and some on my own initiative, both with and without the remote sensor taking part in the control. Unfortunately the results were always far less comfortable than the control from the original thermostat, which I have now reinstalled.\nThere were also two occasions in the approximately one month\u2019s trial that I had to hard reset the ecobee, once for a display freeze and once for a loss of alexa function, which speaks very poorly of the unit\u2019s dependability.\nSo I do not find the performance of the ecobee acceptable and asked for a return under warranty. This is ecobee support\u2019s reply:\n\u201cThe our warranty does not cover compatibility issues and does not provide refunds. The warranty only covers manufacturing defects of the unit.

We replaced an existing, 'non-smart' programmable thermostat.\n\nPros:\nAlexa: It's a really great feature to have built into a thermostat. We put an ecobee 3 lite for our upstairs zone and can control both using voice on this unit. The speaker can be adjusted to be pretty loud for voice feedback and even playing music.\nInterface: The display is bright and the touch screen is responsive. It's easy to make basic changes, but I recommend using the app or web portal to design a schedule or make changes.\nApp: The app is a snap and lets you set and control your temperature settings quickly without even getting up if you don't want to use Alexa.\nSchedule: This is a great feature if you haven't used a programmable thermostat before. Even if you have, the ecobee gives you finer control over the details. The schedule is super easy to set up using a PC on the website.\nSensor: The satellite sensor is a great way to help out with dead spots. Our bedroom gets warmer/cooler than the hallway where the thermostat is located, depending on the season, and the sensor helps keep the temperature closer to what we want.\nReports: The reports that ecobee builds are really helpful in seeing where you stack up in your community and can help you design a more efficient program for your house or apartment. This is probably the best feature because you are seeing the trends of your runtime, current settings, etc.\nDesign: The thermostat looks like it's from the future and includes a backplate which is big enough to cover any places on your wall you want to cover up.\n\nCons:\nWiFi: You need WiFi to get the most out of this thermostat. The thermostat has dropped WiFi once in the 4 months we've had it and I had to do a manual reset, but other than that it's been fine.\nBattery: I was used to thermostats having battery backup, but since it's connected to WiFi, it will resume it's previous schedule, but while the power is out, it won't record any data. Not a huge deal, just takes getting used to if you live in an area with frequent outages.\nWeather: The outside weather can be a little hit and miss. I've compared to the local weather service and it's usually within a couple degrees. Overall though, it does a pretty good job.\n\nIt's hard to find major flaws in this thermostat. I've been very pleased with it so far and I'd recommend this over the Nest which I have some limited experience with. I'd definitely get this again. I think it's already helped me tweak my system to get it running more efficiently and save a little money on utility bills."}

And the light for Alexa should shine down, not up.\n\nThe interface isn't the best either. Pulling the temp up or down is slow and small circle. The menu doesn't clearly lead you to where you want to go. A menu that you think will give you information ends up being an input setting. It displays the outside weather better than trying to find humidity inside the house or reading the temp on a remote sensor.\n\nSiri can control the temp.

Otherwise, I love this thermostat. We took a risk and went ahead and purchased two for our home (to replace both thermostats), and we have not been disappointed. If you are already an avid Alexa user, you will love the Alexa capabilities built into this thermostat. Have not had any issues speaking to Alexa without being right in front of the unit. Having three Alexa devices in the house now, all work independently of one another (if I speak to one I don\u2019t get three responses). Have not tried telling all three to respond (for example asking Alexa to play a song everywhere), but very happy with the Alexa capabilities (works just as well as our Dot). Love being able to schedule the thermostat when away on vacation and the smart follow-me capabilities built in. Changing the temperature is as easy as swiping your finger up or down on the thermostat faceplate (or if you prefer app control, it is basically the same on the app). I love that is not only tells you the temperature, but also the humidity in the room. The one sensor that comes with each is a nice feature to help ensure more balanced temperatures throughout the house (the thermostat counts for one sensor and the movable tiny white sensor counts as a second). We have used this to better control the temperature in our basement and main floor (both share the same thermostat). It is helped keep the basement warmer without raising the temperature on the main floor too much (heat does rise folks). It is also very easy to move your portable sensor around (and change the location name of the sensor in the app). Love the display - very easy to read and not too bright (we have one in our bedroom and it does not prevent us from sleeping - it is not much if at all brighter than the smoke detector light). Like that you can quickly glance at the weather outside on the display. Also, pretty sure on the first day of switching out our old thermostats for the ecobee4 that our heating system immediately became more efficient (we actually turned the temperature down in the house).

I had read so many scary reviews of other networked thermostats where they didn't turn on the heat and pipes froze that I was nervous to purchase one. I had been reading many reviews of the Ecobee over the first three generations that was was ready to pull the trigger on the third generation. Then I read about the fourth Gen that had Amazon Echo built into it which was a huge selling point for me. My home was networked with five echos, automated door locks, automated garage door sensors, automated hard wired and plug in lights, and a SmartThings hub running it all. I had finally decided to pull the trigger and jump into the 4th Gen Ecobee and I am completely glad I did. Installation was easy with a little help from the Tech Support. They were quick and very clear and instructive. I had it installed and running with Alexa running everything in just under 30-minutes. The best reason I provide why I purchased this over the others is not just the reviews but also the sensors that come with it. I purchased two additional sensors to put in rooms on the same floor to be able to sense people in the room as well as the temps in the various rooms they are in. We always seem to have one or two rooms with a wild temp difference from other rooms. It does work! Over the last three weeks, Atlanta has had a lot of cold weather, colder then usual (10s and 20s). The Ecobee kept the first floor balanced at 68 degrees and warm throughout the floor. Easy setup (with some great Tech Support help), great device and it plays music in my hallway!!

Having Alexa in it is nice. But since it doesn't interact with the other Echo products I have, it's not quite as good as a regular Echo dot. I would rather have saved a few bucks on this and just bought an Echo dot for this room separately. Sometimes both this and an Echo dot in a adjacent room will respond to me or set timers, which gets confusing. So I end up muting this one, but then why even have it?\n\n2.) A lot of the built in settings don't make much sense, and I had to research how to fix them - but only some could be fixed. Examples:\n\n- The default setting is that when you change a temperature, it stays there permanently instead of reverting back to the normal schedule when the next event happens. So if you make an adjustment to the norm, you have to remember to change it back. Sometimes I will change it during the day and forget, so I wake up really hot at night. You can change this in the settings.\n\n- The default setting includes 'smart recovery mode' which will turn on the heater or A/C earlier than the schedule you have set to get the temperature right at that time.I let the entire house except for my bedroom get very cold at night, Then 2 hours before I would wake up, the furnace would kick on to try to warm the house up and I'd end up waking up sweating really early. Again, it's an OK feature, but it shouldn't be the default.\n\n- Really annoying one - When you adjust the normal temperature on any setting other than 'home' it messes everything up. My normal daytime temperature only looks at the sensors in my living room and kitchen. The only sensor used while asleep is in the bedroom. If I wake up and adjust the temperature by 1 degree in the middle of the night, it doesn't change the temperature for that sensor by 1 degree, but reverts to using the kitchen and living room sensors, which, again, overheats my room. I haven't found a fix for this, other than to actually go into the settings and change the sleep specific temperature, which is a pain to do in the middle of the night.

The reason for the 4 star vs 5 star review has to do with the the fact that this does not support bluetooth connections. If like me, you use your Alexa devices mostly to play music and have it connected to a Bluetooth speaker, you might consider the purchasing the Ecobee Lite with an Echo Dot. That said, the speaker on the thermostat is decent all things considered. The other issue (well documented in other reviews) is that the mics do not pick up my voice quite as well as the Dot.

Ecobee bests the competition here by including the power extender kit in the box which allows you to do some minor wiring work at your furnace and allow the thermostat to be powered by your HVAC system instead of relying on battery power. Even with the wiring at my furnace, the entire install was less than 45 minutes. Ecobee provides great support via the included install manual, but even better support is provided in the app and on their website making it easy to see this through every step of the way.\n\nOnce installed, controlling my furnace by setting a schedule and inputting our preferred comfort settings was a breeze. I haven\u2019t tested A/C unit control given the temperatures this time of year, but I\u2019m confident the Ecobee will perform well in that task as well. One limitation on the scheduling is only being able to adjust the time in 30 minute increments. This isn\u2019t a huge deal, and can probably be fixed in a software update, but it is odd to not be able to make more refined schedules. Some great features are the occupancy detection which can put the unit into \u201caway\u201d mode if it detects you\u2019re not home, and it\u2019s smart enough to ignore this during \u201csleep\u201d time.\n\nWhat really sets this thermostat apart are two things: the remote sensors and built-in Alexa. The unit comes with one sensor out of the box, and this is a genius way to capture hot or cold spots in your home if the thermostat location isn\u2019t ideal. The setup for the sensor is a breeze and there are a lot of customizable options for how the sensors are integrated into the programming. Alexa integration though is what blows me away with this thermostat. Having this in the unit has been awesome for our household. The included microphones and speaker are great quality and I\u2019ve had no complaints on the Alexa functionality. We have no other Alexa products in our home for comparison, but we\u2019ve been amazed by this feature.\n\nOverall this thermostat lives up to the hype as the best on the market, and I highly recommend!"}

After all, Amazon upgraded my Echo Tap so I don't need to push the button. If only the ecobee had as nice of a speaker. (No, the speaker is not even as good as the one on a Dot.)"}

Maybe it works better with a true 5 wire system, but not with a 4 wire system. Everyday it's a new problem with this thing. Furnaces typically have an auto shutoff for the burners if they are on too long. The ecobee with PEK won't sense that the burners have turned off and keep the fan running indefinitely while blowing out cold air. Usually the fix for this is to turn off the system then turn back on. One day this happened when I was away and I came home to a 57 degree house.\n\nThe main reason I bought the ecobee over the nest was for the remote sensors. My bedroom can get really warm at night so I have the sleep mode to only use the remote sensor in the bedroom. I set this at 60 degrees, sometimes it works other times the heat is running wile the sensor reads 76 degrees.\n\nI will never buy anything from ecobee again. To be honest I'm not sure I will even get a nest or other competing product, I may just go back to the basic dumb thermostat, at least they work."}
{"Author": "Cat", "Date": "on January 13, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Nifty integration of 2 things I didn't really need :)", "Text": "Initial purchase was driven by our pseudo-smart thermostat that was a pain to program manually and would forget all settings whenever the power went out (and didn't automatically handle daylight savings) + interest in trying Alexa without committing to buying a separate device. We also got a sweeeet discount through GA Power, so see if your power provider has any rebates.\n\nAbout a week post-installation, we are loving it. We have a ~1200 sq ft home and the Ecobee is located pretty much smack-dab in the middle of it, in the hallway. That means we can holler at Alexa from most rooms and it can respond; music can reach all rooms assuming no other noise interferes (tv, vacuum cleaner, furnace); can set a timer or alarm by poking head out of the kitchen--awesome when your hands are messy due to food prep! No more smearing the timers with E. coli :). All in all, a neat upgrade for a small home with a fairly open floor plan.\n\nIf we ever want to disconnect Alexa, that's an option, and we'll still have a working thermostat (the thermostat works as long as the furnace is powered; it has flash memory. So, if your wifi is not working you lose some functionality but not the thermostat function itself). The remote temp/occupancy sensor is a bonus and again, useful for a small house where you may need to better inform the main thermostat about what's going on in a room that gets too cold/hot. The music \"service\" that's part of Amazon Prime is sufficient for non-audiophiles who just want to play a few songs here and there but don't need access to every song ever (it also plays any music the registered user has purchased through Amazon).\n\nAs to the thermostat functions, the touch screen, phone app or web interface give multiple access points and are fairly intuitive. The one-touch weather forecast display built into the unit is getting a lot of use. Having the Alexa \"mute\" button at the display is also super convenient (would take half a star off if I could for the fact that disabled Alexa means there's a red glowing bar atop the Ecobee4; just showing the microphone icon as disabled would have been sufficient. Ecobee is supposedly working on this, we'll see if they come through).\n\nHope to update this review later, in particular once the product runs long enough to show us our usage data."}

Maybe took 30 mins, nothing to it\n- Setup on the app was relatively easy, show this on the video as well\n- Sensor was easy to pair and setup\n\nCons\n- Screen is almost like an old DOS Screen, very old and outdated looking\n- Hard to use, had to go through and google a lot to figure out how to change the time zone, to change how high the temp could go, etc..\n- App is frustrating and difficult to use and you can do some things on the device or website you can't do on the app\n- I even had to write support because I couldn't get the time zone changed\n- seriously though it just hasn't performed as well as my Nest, the tempts are cool but nest app and smart is just way better.

I had hoped that the Ecobee4's built-in Echo would actually give me better Echo coverage for the house and my other smart device controls, but the mic's are so weak on the Ecobee4 that I need to be 5-6 foot away for it to clearly pickup voice commands.

Ecobee kicks on your furnace fan at random times. Ecobee support tells you to call a professional installer to \"fix\" it. Ecobee temp swing, is a disaster.

But that\u2019s not it.. there\u2019s also labeling stickers included in the ecobee install kit which is very convenient and important to do. Simply observe each wire in old thermostat and match the sticker to the correct wire before disconnecting.

And based on your answers, the ecobee app eliminates wires that your not dealing with and will show you a diagram of the wires you DO have and how to connect them. I think the ecobee app is great and REALLY simplified the whole install.\nI was definitely impressed with myself when I was done. More so cause I couldn\u2019t believe that the ecobee powered right on with no problems, troubleshooting or tech support.\n\nThe one and only con (which is why I didn\u2019t rate it 5 stars) is that I agree with ALL the other reviewers regarding the faulty Alexa feature in ecobee 4. I love the concept but find it much quicker to look up information rather then trying to communicate with her (Alexa).\nIt also doesn\u2019t vibe well with our other Alexa (Amazon Echo) in the kitchen. There\u2019s a bit of a delay when the ecobee Alexa \u201cfeels\u201d like working.

Either walk you through prep, connection options, and actual thermostat boot up and configuration.\n\nCONNECTION:\nUnlike their main competitor, Nest, which provides a battery option, the Ecobee 4 runs ONLY on an electrical wire, also known as a 'c' wire. Before you sweat that you need an electrician, there are a few ways to get lucky here.\n\n1. You already have a 'C' wire on your existing thermostat. Thermostat wire is usually run as 18/4 or 18/5, being 18 gauge 4 wires or 18 gauge 5 wires. Ideally here, you have 5 wires.\n\n2. If you have only 4 wires currently connected, you still may be in luck. Check where the thermostat is mounted, and by the furnace wires. If you have an unused wire, often curled around the end of the wire sheath, and usually BLUE, you are pretty much home free. It does NOT have to be blue, that's just the most common free wire.\n\n3. If you do not have 5 wires in use or a free 5th wire, another option is to re-purpose the fan wire (usually green). This will limit your ability to run the fan alone without the HVAC on, but is an option.\n\n4. You can use the provided \"power extender\" kit, which basically connects at the furnace end, and makes use of existing wiring for thermostat power.\n\nStill with me? I got lucky and had an unused blue wire, so I connected that to the C terminator on my furnace control board AND the C terminal on the Ecobee baseplate. Assuming you can make a connection with one of the four methods above\u2026..\n\nINSTALLATION:\nFirst decide if you are going to use the optional trim plate. I found a tacky contrast, because the Ecobee is sleek black and the trimplate is white plastic (like recessed light d blue wire, so I connected that to the C terminator on my furnace control board AND the C terminal on the Ecobee baseplate. or smoke detector trim). I preferred to take my old thermostat off the wall, still wired, spackle, and prime and paint my wall.\n\nAfter that, basically, you take pictures or notes of what wires go where on the old thermostat, then remove the connections, making sure to tie or tape off the wires so they don\u2019t fall into the wall! Then mount the Ecobee baseplate. It even has a tiny level in it to help you keep it straight.\nYou drill two 3/16\u201d holes for its anchors and screw it to the wall. Then the wires connect into little locking terminals. Mount the Ecobee onto the baseplate, aligning the pins and snapping it into place.\n\nCONFIGURATION:\nTurn on your power. The Echobee will boot up, and walk you through prompts about your systems, etc. Nothing technical and you can go back and change everything.\nI found it easiest to do the basic setup and then use their website to make schedules, etc.\n\nTIP: Along with the Ecobee phone app, remember to also launch your Alexa app and discover the Ecobee under Smart Home. This will give you full access and flexibility with the thermostat. Once your device is discovered and named (example \u201dUpstairs\u201d), you can use any of your Echo, Dot, etc. to control it, along with the thermostat itself. Remember though, this is an Alexa-enabled device not an Eco, so it won\u2019t handle some Alexa features like join a music device group, etc.\n\nFEATURES:\nYou can make a myriad of schedules, on the fly adjustments, vacation schedules, and make use of the on-board sensor and included free-standing sensor to tell when rooms are occupied and have the thermostat adjust settings for a cold spot. Very neat. Alexa-connectivity is a big feature, of course, and smart \u201crecovery\u201d modes are helpful for efficiency and comfort. This is where the thermostat learns how your HVAC works, and factors in weather, to start its cycles early enough to reach the desired set points on time. Factor in the ability to control the thermostat via Alexa, smartphones, and a PC dashboard, and the Ecobee does just about everything.\n\nCONS:\nThere are a few things I do not like about the Ecobee, so although overall I li it a lot, these are BIG annoyances:\n1. You seem to have to adhere to half hour increments, so you can choose 6 AM or 6:30 AM, but not 6:15 AM. That\u2019s silly on a device this versatile, and most programmable thermostats, smart or not, offer that flexibility.\n\n2. The schedule comfort settings and activities require a heat and cooling setting in each. I have a need to have more frequent temp changes for cooling than heating, so instead of being able to add a cooling only \u201cactivity\u201d, I had to make an activity with both heat/cooling, and leave the heat setting the same as the prior activity, while changing the cooling temp. As with the time increments, sloppy.\n\n3. Alexa is slower to respond on the Ecobee than on my 1st gen Echo, 2nd gen Echo, or Eco Dot. This occasionally results in my Echo in the adjacent room responding first, but with the Ecobee\u2019s blue Alexa light still on.\n\nOverall though, I like it and am glad I installed it. I think Ecobee needs a firmware upgrade though, to allow for more flexibility in scheduling, such as 15 minute increments, and more individualized heating/cooling comfort settings"}

I was a bit intimidated by having to rewire my furnace thermostat wiring, but the instructions worked beautifully to get the C wire benefits from the power unit supplied by Ecobee. The thermostat works great. Much better control with the old digital thermostat I was using. Alexa is a plus and it's not close to my other Echoes, so there isn't any confusion. If there was, I'd just shut the microphone off. I got a $100 rebate from my gas company and a $50 from my electric company. You'll have to check with your own utilities to see what's available. With the holiday $50 price reduction, I ended up buying the unit (net after the rebates come in) for $50. The Ecobee 3 lite didn't qualify for the gas company rebate, so it ended up less than the cheaper version. The graphics are great. I have it working with my Echo Dots and with Apple Homekit. The sensor is in our bedroom and we really haven't had a chance to see how well it works, but so far, so good. I recommend it, even if the built-in Alexa integration doesn't make sense. If you are close enough to talk, you are close enough to lift your finger and change the temps with your digits. For $50, how can I go wrong?"}

{"Author": "David R. Smith", "Date": "on December 30, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Eureka!! My Ecobee4 works perfectly with my Aprilaire 700M whole-house humidifier!", "Text": "I got the Aprilaire 700M (manual) version because with a smart thermostat, you don't need an outdoor sensor to tell the temperature. The idea is that the relative humidity (RH) inside your house should decrease as the outside temperature also decreases. Otherwise you'll get condensation on the windows and other parts of your home, leading to frost, freezing, dry-rot in your attic or window sills, etc. The Ecobee4 knows the temperature at your location (via Wi-Fi connection) and has a \"Frost Control\" setting that will automatically adjust the home's humidity level accordingly; no need to use the manual humidistat and constantly change the humidity setting as temperatures change.\n\nI've attached a diagram of the exact wiring I used -- even the colors are the same. It took combining about 4 different diagrams that only told part of the story, a call to customer service, an email to an HVAC guy, and bit of trial and error (e.g. I had to learn not to use the HUM connection on my furnace because it's only charged when blowing heat) but my Aprilaire 700M and Ecobee4 now work PERFECTLY together! When I need humidity in my house, my thermostat will turn on the furnace fan and the humidifier to add humidity without heat... as well as with heat, if needed.\n\nIMPORTANT Instructions:\n1) You DO NOT need to use/wire the humidistat control (dial-a-humidity level) because the Ecobee4 perfectly takes it's place (actually, it does a much better job).\n2) You have to know that when you set up your humidifier with Ecobee, you have to tell it that it's a \"steam\" humidifier, NOT an evaporative one. This is not true, but it will allow the Ecobee to call for humidity even without heat blowing.\n3) You need to purchase an extra relay to make the call for humidity without heat to work. Aprilaire recommends the Aprilaire 4851 relay. I'm not convinced there isn't a less expensive relay that will make this work, but I know the 4851 will work.\n4) Take note that the G (green) wire needs to be disconnected from your furnace control board. This is according to the 4851 relay instructions. There are a few other oddities with the wiring too, so pay close attention.\n5) Be sure to use 18-guage wire for 24 volt purposes (which is all this diagram shows)\n6) I used the 2-wire setup for my Ecobee; there is a 1-wire installation, but I couldn't get it to work.\n7) I did not need to use the transformer the Aprilaire 700M came with (because I didn't need extra 24v power).\n8) When using no-heat with your humidifier, please note that Aprilaire recommends installing the humidifier on the hot-air service side of your furnace plenum, and to use hot water to flow into your 700M. This will allow the water to evaporate better. I'm going to add insulation around my 1/4\" copper tubing (sold seperately needed for installation, with compression fasteners) to keep the water a little hotter. I used a SharkBite valve (Model # 24983A; 1/2\" push-to-connect, 1/2\" push-to-connect, and 1/4\" compression fitting) to tap into my hot water line. The SharkBite fittings made it super easy to install onto my PEX hot water pipe. You may want to use something similar if you don't want to use the saddle valve the 700M came with (which I couldn't, nor did I want to run the risk).\n\nI had virtually no plumbing or electrical experience before doing this install, so you can do it too!\n\nI've attached a few other photos and the diagram that came with the 4851 relay, and the Ecobee4.\n\nI hope this helps! And enjoy your new perfectly comfortable home!\n\np.s. Be sure to go to your electric company's website and look for a rebate on smart thermostats; the two main ones here in Colorado Springs both offer a $50 rebate!!! Free money."}

{"Author": "M. Head", "Date": "on December 29, 2017", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Alexa support probably isn't worth it over the ecobee3", "Text": "I had purchased and installed an ecobee3 in a previous home and had such a good experience with it I purchased 2 of the ecobee4 for our new home, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. These were our first devices that were \"Alexa-enabled\", so I was excited to see how well that would work with these thermostats.\nAlexa compatibility is just \"OK\" on the ecobee4, in my opinion. It's not a Smart Home compatible device, so you can't have Alexa control it directly, only indirectly, such as \"Alexa, ask ecobee to set the temperature to 70 upstairs\". If you forget to tell Alexa to \"ask ecobee\", then she responds with \"You have no smart home devices\", despite having added the \"ecobee plus\" skill. Also, the microphone on the ecobee4 is very weak; you have to direct your voice right at the device and you can't be too far away.\nAs for the non-Alexa features, the ecobee line is great. I love their little design decisions, from the great packaging to the small level on the wiring panel so you can ensure it's level before screwing it to the wall; they include a larger panel to cover up marks left behind by the old thermostat; their wiring diagrams and instructions take into account tons of options for what your furnace might present; the app and thermostat itself pack in a bunch of useful features. Also, the remote sensors are very useful when you want a room to dictate the temperature where the thermostat isn't located. I do wish the app itself (on the thermostat and on iOS) had snappier UIs; the fancy animations sometimes make them feel sluggish.\nOverall, I'd highly recommend an ecobee, but maybe not this one if you're expecting Alexa to be the main feature you'll use."}

My rule, and should be the rule of others, if after the 2nd attempt in get something like this to work, stop, put it back in it's box and take it back. As soon as you think you need to call technical support, you are doomed. Just think of your IT group at work. Lot's of laughs. Going back to my simple programmable unit that just freaking works."}

The whole thing took about an hour to install and works like a dream. My favorite feature of the device is the remote sensor. We have a 2-story house and the temperature is always out of wack both in the summer and winter. Since installing the ecobee, the temperature is perfectly balanced between in the entire house. In case you're wondering how that works, the device operates the HVAC unit's fan independent of heat or cold to balance the temp wherever the sensors are placed. Really nice feature compared to other smart thermostat options.\n\nOn the Alexa front, the thermostat sits outside my office and I use it often to set timers, alarms, play music and add items to my shopping list.

It took quite a bit of work to get it installed because I did not have the correct wire hooked up in at my boiler control unit but after a couple hours I got it up and running. I got it up and running and it worked great for a couple weeks until it started going haywire. First off it keep disconnecting the Alexa part from the WiFi network but it was still online. This was random and the only way to fix it was to remove the unit from the wall and let it restart, after doing this every couple days I gave up and forgot about using the Alexa built it. Next thing it decided to do a couple weeks ago was go completely off the charts with the temperature reading. I looked over one evening because I was starting to feel cold in the house and I had not noticed the boiler run in a couple hours. To my surprise it was reading that it was 85 in the living room!!!! First off I can tell you it was NOT that warm in the house and after checking the unit I noticed that the other sensor in the other room was reading 65. I was able to figure out how to run the unit off the sensor and not the master units thermostat and after a couple days it worked it self down to an accurate reading. Lastly and the most frustrating thing was when I can home early from work today to find that the house was still 71 and the boiler was still running when the unit was set to 64!! I don\u2019t know how long it had keep the boiler running but I don\u2019t want to think of the fule I waisted while it kept the house way warmer then I had it set at all day and for how many days it was not correctly heating the house. If it wasn\u2019t for the extra holes in the wall I had to drill to mount the plate I would remove the unit and go back to the cheap thermostat that came with the house and drop the temperature myself when I leave for the day.

I did some tests and my Echo's in other rooms are picking up and responding when I'm 5ft away from the thermostat. The blue light on the Ecobee thermostat signals that it is listening only when I am directly facing it and less that 4 ft away. That's horrible. I would still recommend the Ecobee's previous version 3(cheaper than NEST) but the only reason I went with Ecobee4 instead of nest was because of Alexa mic added to a room for listening.

Love voice control.", "Text": "This is a great thermostat. The only problem I ran into was only having two wires to my boiler (old house) and needing to install new wiring as well as an additional transformer. This was all conveyed to me when I talked to ecobee support after reading that they didn't support my situation out of the box. Though a major bummer, I wisely decided not to freak out. According to their literature, they support over 90% of situations out of the box. The support folks were very helpful. They asked for pictures of my setup and sent me instructions. Pretty great. I highly recommend you run the compatibility checker before buying this thermostat as depending on your situation there may be a fair amount of work to do to before basking in the glow of your new automation.\nI bought a honeywell 24v transformer and wired it up to my junction box. I then added another junction box where my four thermostat wires could meet up. Before I did that, I connected my new wire to the old wire, pulled it through and then wired it up to the ecobee wiring box as they suggested. They sent me the pinouts so it was simple. Had I run the compatibility checker beforehand, I would have paid the extra $$ to buy installation with the device. One minor annoyance is that when the ecobee is finally working and setup, you cannot control it with voice right away. You first have to enable some settings on the Amazon.com site. You can do this with the Alexa app or you can do it through Amazon directly on their site. The Alexa app didn't work when I tried to use it at first, but they have since fixed the issue. Secondly, you have to be careful trying to get homekit set up as most routers support two frequencies and your phone/ipad may be on the wrong one. I fully believe this is a problem that ecobee could help you with (software), but it becomes your problem instead. The ecobee app is decent but there is room for improvement (2.3 stars) and the ipad/iphone versions support different feature sets. You cannot setup homekit on the ipad version. On the iphone version you can but it may not connect until you figure out how to switch your phone/ipad to the correct frequency. For this reason, I have yet to set up homekit, which is a huge bummer as that was one of my main reasons to buy. Alexa support is very good and contrary to what others have said it does pick up your voice from far away. I asked it from upstairs (three rooms away) what time it was and it heard me perfectly. The main way the thermostat software works is that there are three default settings (home, away, sleep). You get to set a default temperature for each and then create a schedule (if desired). The ecobee will also notice if you are not home but this seems to take quite some time there is no way (other than by using a schedule) to improve the way it works. The main advantage I can see so far, is that the ecobee turns my boiler on much less often, trying to run it for longer periods to bring it up to temperature depending upon my schedule. I haven't gotten a bill yet, but this seems intelligent and probably will be much less wear and tear on your equipment. If you haven't used Alexa, it is quite good. You can play music, check the status of amazon orders, control your fire TV (in between reboots) and much more. My thermostat is in the dining room and it is often quite nice to play some light music during dinner. One of my favorite features of the thermostat is the chart which plots desired temp / inside temp / outside temp / heating / cooling periods. Had I known beforehand that I was incompatible, I would make the same decision. Along with saving more money, being more comfortable is nice. When I wake up in the morning, the house is toasty. The thermostat seems to be quite good at figuring out when to start heating to hit your programmed intervals (Smart Recovery) and I'm sure it will only get better. One thing that is lacking is the ability to override with an alternate schedule for a group of days. You can set a vacation temp, but having been home a lot during the holidays, I would have liked to be able to use one of my configured days for a vacation setting (eg. Saturday) Your only recourse is to override and then revert to achieve your bedtime setting which I imagine is much less efficient energy wise as it cannot plan the intervals."}

My thermostat has an intermittent issue when I command Alexa to do something i.e. lock the front door, play a song, or lower the temperature but instead of doing the command Alexa starts to process it and goes into a loop of listening and processing over and over and nothing else can happen on the thermostat until I either unplug it from the wall or cycle the air handler (to take away C-common power). I notified Ecobee and they responded quickly but asked me to unplug it from the wall when it happens to see if it fixes it although I told them this is already the fix I have used and the issue returns. Now they want me to send them a video when the issue happens again and I feel like for the price they should send me a new unit and lab test it themselves.

We also have 2 zones, one for the basement and one for the main two floors. After installing an Ecobee4 in the basement and on the main floor, I put one remote sensor in the master bedroom and one in the upstairs hallway. I then setup 4 modes; sleep, morning, home, and away.\n\nSleep: reads the temperature from master bedroom and keeps us comfortable all night.\n\nMorning: 1 hour before I get up for work, I have it read the temperature from the hallway (very cold) and set it to a warmer setting. This makes the bedroom kind of warm but we are getting up anyway. Much easier to walk down the hall to the bathroom.\n\nHome: After \"Morning\" has been running for an hour, we switch to home mode, which reads the temperature from the main floor, where the Ecobee4 is installed. This is fine for most of the day if people are home.\n\nAway automatically kicks in if there is no motion at any of the thermostats or remote sensor for 2 hours. Neat feature but I didn't like the 2 hour delay. I already have Smartthings turn off certain things when we are all out of the house and it does it within 10 minutes of everyone leaving. Ecobee4 is compatible with Smartthings so I just added it to the Away mode in Smartthings. Now, 10 minutes after the last person leaves the house, Smartthings tells Ecobee4 to lower the temperature, and turns off a bunch of things. When someone comes home, Smartthings tells Ecobee4 to resume its normal schedule, and turns a bunch of things back on.\n\nThe last feature I really like is the vacation mode. It is an actual schedule, not just a mode you turn on and off. My old thermostat was web enabled so I would lower the temp when I left and then, in theory, use the web app to turn it back up before I got home, in theory. Reality is I would forget until I was 5 minutes from home or home.\n\nThe Ecobee4 vacation mode is an actual schedule. You tell it what day and time to go to vacation mode and what day and time to return to normal mode. For example, we went away for the weekend a few weeks ago. I had it go to 60 degrees at 10AM the day we left and had it \"resume\" normal schedule 2 hours before we were due home. The result is, we walked in to a comfortable house when we got home!\n\nOf course it has a great web app that lets you adjust things if you have to, from anywhere."}

I can be downstairs and tell alexa to change the upstairs temperature to whatever I decide. No walking upstairs, no getting out my phone and changing it on the app, just tell Alexa what I want it to be.

I called my furnace installer (new furnace about 4 years ago). He came a discovered that all the wiring was correct but there is a setting in the set up that needed to be changed - to have the fan controlled by the furnace not the thermostat. We made the change and bingo we had heat. Cost me $75. He said he has seen nothing but problems from all the Wi-Fi thermostats. Here I am 7 days later and the heat doesn't work again. The wait time on ecobee4 support is forever. Also, let mention I cannot get Alexa to connect to ecobee which is supposed to be a big advantage. Alexa works independently and can answer questions but I can also look up questions on my computer just as easily. So far this thing has cost us money and looks like it will cost us more money. There is no advantage of using the ecobee over your regular thermostat. Good luck!"}

I had been using the older Ecobee Smart from 2012 when I built my house. My only real complaint with the old one was that it would not really control our ventilator (heat recovery exchanger). I could turn it on, but it would only run for 20 min. and then shut off. The Ecobee folks promised me that real control (e.g. scheduled running) would be in a later software update, but after 5 years and a few newer versions of the product, it was clear they had no interest in the old model.\nThen I read that the new one could do full ventilator control, so I jumped at it with the promotional price.\nThe old Ecobee Smart had a large wiring panel that was located next to the furnace, and all the wires went through it. This was a hassle, but it allowed a lot of wiring options. Of course, the new one does not have that. Everything I read about the Ecobee4 said it could control \"humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ventilators.\" After a call to technical support, I learned it could only handle ONE accessory! So here in 2017, they came out with a top-of-the-line new Smart Thermostat that CAN'T CONTROL FREQUENTLY USED HVAC COMPONENTS!!! I found this idiotic, and the tech support guy did not seem at all sympathetic (which only infuriated me more).\nSince it usually uses all 6 wires just for the basic components, my HVAC guy and I managed to use the Power Extender Kit to free up two wires for the ventilator. This left our humidifier which I'll have to get a separate controller for. I find it very disappointing that after several years of upgrades, Ecobee still isn't supporting devices many new homes are coming with.\nI will say that the interface, online account site, and special features look very nice. Alexa only worked for me for about 3 minutes, and since then I have not been able to get her to respond. I'm waiting to hear back from customer service about that part.\nI'm also hopeful that the additional room sensors will be an added improvement. It would have been nice if they had included more than just one, but I guess that's to be expected.\nUpdate: After rebooting the Ecobee (removing from the wall and replacing), Alexa works again. Took customer service a few days to respond, but they apologized for the delay. I think for anyone with just a furnace and A/C, this is great. With additional modules like humidifier and/or ventilator, it takes some extra work and may not be the best option."}

I called ecobee tech support and got a very knowledgeable man on the other end that seem to know exactly what was going on. My furnace only has two wires, he said it needs another common wire that is also 24 V. I got my electrician to come out and pull a 24 V wire tapped on to my air-conditioner controller. I then hooked it up the way I was told and still nothing. Then the email fiasco started where it seemed the Support techs were more in a hurry to close your ticket then to help you with it. They would ask me the same questions over and over, are your air-conditioning and heating units made by the same manufacturer. In my case no.

Installation was easy enough; I had five wires ran to the old thermostat and only four was connected at the furnace. I had to make the connection there to be able to power on the ecobee. The instructions were very clear and setup was a breeze after that. I like having a second sensor in the house. The ecobee is able to get the average between the two and regulate the temperate accordingly.\n\nOne feature that I didn't see and love is from the ecobee website. Once the device is setup and running, you can log into your account and see the data from the thermostat. You can see when and how long the furnace had been running, the temperatures of the sensors and outside throughout each day, and see when the thermostat's temperature was modified. There is a lot of data to go off of and excited to see what my monthly usage looks like.\n\nThe state I live in also does a $100 rebate for smart thermostats making this a good buy. Once it comes in, I will be buying two additional sensors to be placed in my home.\n\nUPDATE:\nIt has been over a month now and I am still loving this system. I bought two more sensors for a total of 4 (including the thermometer) in my home. I have a multi-level home and this is perfect; one for each level. Because I am able to see the temperature differences for each level, I have been able to adjust the vent flow for each room to allow the best comfort level for my home. The thermometer has an option to pull the average of all sensors attached or ignore certain sensors. One of my comfort levels is for sleeping. I have it ignore the top two levels (usually the warmest) and focus on the basement levels since these are cooler. This allows the best comfort level for the basement area.\n\nOne thing we noticed was when we were out of the home for an extended amount of time, we would set it to \"Away\" which dropped it from 71 degrees to 63 degrees. We were out for 10 hours and I had it turn back on before we returned. We got back and it was back to normal. The next day, I took a look at the data and found that the furnace had to run for a full 3 hours to return back to 71 degrees. In comparison to other days we found that our furnace would run only for an hour over a span of 8 hours to keep the temperature at the comfort level. The \"Away\" option is not a good option if only for a few hours. Granted the outside average temperature was 25 degrees, but it is more beneficial to keep it going unless you are out for more than one day. Without this thermostat, I wouldn't have been able to find this out."}

It was incredibly easy and intuitive to set up and it works flawlessly and it works wonderfully with Alexa (from my echo dot). The interface is understated yet beautiful, the options of controlling via app, physical device or voice are all fantastic and work as intended which brings me to the second part:\n\n\"Built in Alexa\": Its more like a built in speaker I and my kids have to stand in front of and scream at to get it to wake and then just wait for it to finish whatever task it thought you told it to do before you can scream at it again. The Alexa implementation is absolutely terrible. You have to be within a couple feet of it to hear you and even then it takes a few times of screaming \"ALEXA\" before it will acknowledge you. By then you've become frustrated and forgot what it is you wanted to ask it anyway and have to start the process over again. Told it to play Jingle Bells but it plays Jingle BAlls?

The fact is you can get a cell phone for under $60 which is much more sophisticated than a temperature gauge, motion sensors, extra. Yet thanks to these cell phone advancements we will have these smart devices popping up in everything maybe even monitoring your dog's poop.\nThe device itself is great with a few exceptions make you aware of these before you buy be sure to read my recommendations before deciding.\nAlthough I bought this device at discount price being black Friday. I want to make individuals aware of the problems I found which some could be fixed with firmware updates, yet will they? I am not counting on it but would be happy if they did it.\n\nCONS\n1. Microphone, This is the biggest issue unlike Amazon echo, the device can\u2019t hear me linked up to Alexa in so many cases I speak it just can\u2019t hear me other times I say words like Al it thinks I said Alexa, 6/10 times I speak to it even five feet away can\u2019t hear me or detect I am saying ALEXA, this compounds when playing music. If they fixed this alone I give it 5/5 instead it automatically looses 1/5.\n2. Cost, The default price of this device less sophisticated than 99 cent app + <$60 phone selling for $250 is too high just as Nest is too high should be less or equal to low end smartphone, probably someday. So in marketplace they are filling a need too against nest, so I certainly can\u2019t lower my ratings vote.\n3. Alexa, Besides the microphone the fact is you can\u2019t really use all the features of Alexa your really limited on the Amazon only music, various other things are not available on this device. Understandably Amazon didn\u2019t give them their echo code to not have an echo answer twice. Those unfamiliar with this echo automatically can detect if another echo is closer to you and only respond on the closer echo.\n4. Website integration is a wash reason is because it doesn\u2019t use geofencing or any other thing far as I can tell. Also, kind of big brother data gathering with address, motion detection, house/family stats are gathered. Also, it\u2019s centralized so what happens if company goes out of business or the device can\u2019t connect to it via website changes over the years.\n\nPros:\n1. The device in my opinion is very simple to use and setup but thermostats in general are.\n2. The device integrates with many latest AI Alexa, Google, and without them.\n3. The device competes with Nest\n4. The data gathered by big brother techniques can help you figure out how your house\u2019s efficiency along with motion sensory data.\n5. The touch screen/api/website aka cellphone/tablet technology going into this industry is a good thing\n6. Remote control your heating and cooling from your phone. Passwords along with extra security pin codes for big changes.\n\nRecommendation: Don\u2019t buy.. What? Yes. I said don\u2019t buy this because of the microphone situation is so bad it\u2019s terrible. The fact is you should buy Echo + older version of Ecobee which is overall cheaper. Especially if you can find discount on one or other. Echo has a much better microphone and can overhear me over music and my voice. I am sure the microphone of Ecobee to even compete has to noise cancel their own speaker beforehand."}

Since then Ecobee has improved the Alexa performance of the Ecobee4. It is still not quite as quick or responsive as Amazon's Echo devices, especially when playing sounds itself. But using Alexa with it is now much more often satisfying than frustrating. So I have added a star to the rating and I now recommend this rather than the ecobee3 Lite/Dot combination unless you need messaging, reminders, or music. (The combination still works better but not enough better to warrant using two separate devices). Ecobee has mentioned that further improvements are coming -- though it hasn't, as far as I know, said what or when -- so it might gain some of the abilities it still lacks.\n\nI bought this to replace an ecobee3 Lite in order to get the Alexa functionality. I also use an ecobee3 so I am familiar with these units.\n\nAs a thermostat it is essentially the same as the others. The wiring is like that on the ecobee3 Lite, which is a little different than the ecobee3. The mounting plate is smaller in order to accomodate the speaker, which means that if you're replacing an older ecobee you need to drill an extra hole.\n\nAs an Alexa device there are a few things to keep in mind.\n\n1. If you use Alexa primarily to play music, this is not for you. Its streaming capability is limited, it cannot connect to external speakers, and its own speaker -- while it will play music -- is not really suited for it. This is more like an Echo Dot than an Echo; this Alexa is for speaking, such as for news and information, alarms and timers, and voice control of home automation. (This won't surprise those who have some experience with Echos and Dots but seems to have surprised some of the Amazon reviewers.)\n\n2. Even for those purposes it is not as capable as Amazon's own Alexa devices. It does not do messaging or reminders. I guess I can understand why someone decided not to let you make or receive calls through your thermostat. But the reason for not being able to set reminders is a mystery.\n\n3. This Alexa is a little hard of hearing compared to an Echo or Dot. Once you get her attention she seems to hear well except when you need to interrupt her -- to skip an item in your news briefing, for example. She has trouble with that.\n\n4. Response time often seems longer than with an Echo or Dot, though not greatly so.\n\nI have not been able to use the ecobee4 with the ecobee Alexa skill. The newer \"ecobee plus\" skill works but requires the extra step of telling Alexa to ask ecobee to control the thermostat rather than just telling Alexa (which isn't hard when I remember it but an annoyance most of the time since I usually don't).\n\nI like ecobee products and so I wish I liked this one more. It has potential but needs some tweaks in the firmware, or the servers, or somewhere to make it smoothly useful rather than a bit of a pain. Until then my advice is to use an ecobee3/3 Lite and a Dot."}

Ecobee has created a product that can do all of these things, and more, at the same time, but only under the right conditions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nIf your home is occupied 24/7 and you use Ecobee remote room sensors to regulate temps throughout your home, then Ecobee may have to run your A/C or heat more often (depending on the season) to mitigate the hot/cold spots. Your home will be more comfortable, but you probably won\u2019t see any energy savings (maybe the opposite). Or you may see savings during winter months but not summer or vica/versa.\n\nIf your home is unoccupied for most of the day, and you use Ecobee remote sensors to detect occupancy, it will take some time before Ecobee recognizes your home is unoccupied, so it won\u2019t change modes immediately. When it does change modes, it won\u2019t go straight into \u201cAway mode\u201d. Instead it will use an algorithm based on several factors, like the outdoor weather, what your away temp is set at, what the current indoor temp is, the time of day, etc\u2026 and set a temp that will allow the unit to come back up to occupied temperature without working too hard or taking too long once you return. This is actually very efficient because in most situations, it requires more energy to bring your home to a comfortable temperature than it does just to maintain a comfortable temp. Ecobee does a combination of both for improved efficiencies, and comfort (who doesn\u2019t want that?).\n\nIf you want your system to turn off when you open a window, it can do that too, but only if you have a home automation system to send a command to the Ecobee to turn off when a window (or group of windows) opens.\n\nAgain, you have to educate yourself on how all this stuff works. These are just a few examples, in reality there are endless possibilities.\n\nI choose Ecobee over the leading competitor for the following reasons:\n\n1. My home is occupied 24/7 so I didn\u2019t need something learning my habits, instead I wanted to mitigate hot/cold spots for a more consistent temp throughout my home.\n\n2. Ecobee integrates natively with Samsung SmartThings which I have and use as a home automation solution.\n\n3. Ecobee, has proven their commitment to support this product and continue to improve it. For example, they have already made a major improvement after its initial release, by working with Amazon to add ESP \u201cEcho Spatial Perception\u201d to Ecobee\u2019s Alexa, via a firmware update (this happens automatically). This was not easy, as they are the first manufacture that Amazon has allowed to use this technology, so it\u2019s a real testament to their commitment to the product.\n\nThe bottom line is, you need to have realistic expectations and understand how Ecobee is designed to work. If you think replacing your current thermostat with an Ecobee and some room sensors is going to turn your central HVAC system into a high efficiency, mini-split, zoned system, then you\u2019re in for a big disappointment. You will have to invest a lot more than $250 to do that!\n\nIf room sensors, and built in Alexa/Echo are not important to you, then look at the Ecobee 3 lite. It will still work with room sensors and Alexa, they\u2019re just not included.\n\nWhat Ecobee does, it does well! The question is, will Ecobee do what you want it to do? For me, the answer is yes."}

The interface and UI works great. It did take a little bit to get the configrutation right with the heat and A/C. The hardest part was by far the reconfigurtion of the wires on your HVAC panel. You will have to do some \"hardware\" tweaking to install this. But the directions are straight forward and very helpful. Even if you have issues, I've heard the customer support is great (although I didn't have to use them). Overall, the thermostat itself 5-stars.\n\nWhere I knock off two stars is the Alexa feature. I bought this ecobee from my utility company because they had a huge deal over cyber Monday. I thought it pertitent to write the review here as the issue(s) are with Alexa and not the thermostat itself.\n\nI bought it thinking, \"Perfect, I'll get an Echo Dot, put it down stairs, and have the whole house covered by Alexa.\" Nope. The Alexa within the Ecobee4 is a half-baked Alexa. While you can still ask it the typical Alexa questions, it won't do many skills. Two big ones I've noticed so far (from 3 days of having it installed):\n1. No bluetooth speaker capability. Most, if not all Amazon Alexa devices will connect to a bluetooth speaker. This one does not.\n2. The feature \"Alexa, start my day\" where Alexa will read you news that you select, weather, traffic, etx. does not work either.\n\nAnother issue is that many times the Echo Dot picks up my Alexa commands better than the Echobee4 while I am in the same room as the Echobee4. Which causes an issue because I can't hear what the Dot is saying back.\n\nI will say, it is nice to control the temperature by voice command, but that is dependent on the above not happening.\n\nOverall, the thermostat works great, Alexa, not so much. I would recommend a cheaper Echobee and just purchasing a Dot. Maybe they will come out with an update that provides the full capabilities of Alexa. Until then, just be wary about the features of it."}

I do not have anything to compare the Ecobee against besides my 1953 thermostat. Like many it was a tough decision between the Ecobee or the Nest. I do like the appearance of the Nest a little better. I also like how the Nest takes full advantage of their display showing you the Temp, time, date, outside temp, humidity all on the home screen... Ecobee claims to have the larger screen??? why not take advantage of that!\nWith all that being said I went ahead with the Ecobee. I liked the idea of the room sensors, Alexa, my friends recommendation, ease of installation, and data collection along with other features the nest an bee share.\nThe Bee could be a 5 stare product, however, it needs some updates before its there!\n\nInstallation - I thought I had everything figured out... went to turn the power back on annnnndd NOTHING! :/ Long story short I caved and called customer service. A very nice and very patient lady talked me through hooking up their power device and everything works after that!\n\nApp - It works. I can check and monitor the temperature any time on my phone! Pretty cool.\n\nSchedule - Seems to be working fine... You have to log into the website to create a \"comfort zone\" but once I figured that out I was okay.\n\nSensors - This is were ecobee really needs to make some improvements. Love the idea of follow me and breaking away form the schedule based on the sensors. Giving the user more control with these features would create a game changer!\n-Cant adjust how long a sensors stays occupied after it gets detected.\n-Cant adjust when the sensors work for disrupting a schedule. ie. home when your schedule says you are away. currently i believe it takes an hour!\n-Once you disrupt a schedule and the sensors go back to unoccupied does not mean your thermostat goes back to away mode.\n-With how expensive the sensors are it would be nice to see them integrate with Alexa better. For example turn on lights, send notifications, etc....\n\nAlexa - I have not used that part yet.\n\nHome screen - Wish you had more customization options.\n\nAll in all i think its a great product and looking forward to a more comfortable house and energy savings! :) Will be looking forward to firmware updates to see if any of these features get fixed!"}

If the temp goes above 68 it turns on a fan and sucks cold air in. Not efficient at all. I would like to retain that extra hot air so I can go longer before my heater kicks on again. There is not way to disable this feature that I can find, The fan setting just has one and auto.\n\n2) customer support has been terrible.\n- my first interaction they just pushed an FAQ at me that had no relationship to this question about the fan.\n- They do not work over the weekend.

I am very good with technology, both designing and using it. I can't be the only person with these issues. This product is not easy to use, and is way more in-efficient than the non smart thermostat that I replaced."}

I called tech support to ensure what is was reading was correct and to determine what to do with the additional wires. Well that started it. Tech support is out sourced, but that aside i was told that the device may not be compatible. They requested photos of the thermostat, the air handler (requiring me to pull covers off) etc. I gave them my email and phone number. The Tech said he would call me back once he looked at the photos and let me know if I would be able to install the device and what wires went wherel. Simple enough, i waited... and waited... and waited.. 3 hours later i look at me email and there is an email from him asking where the \"black wire was connected?\" Now i like to think i'm pretty tech savvy, but if i am calling you for help and sending you photos... how am i supposed to know what the black wire is connected too. Never mind the fact he was supposed to CALL me back not just email me.\n\nPlease ensure this works with your system if you decide to buy it. Their tech support sucks. I returned this and bought a nest thermostat. They provided a custom wiring diagram online and it took me 15 mins to install and have it working with my Alexa. Down side I have an Alexa on my dresser. Not a big deal to me. Both were the same price. Just alot less headaches with the NEST. Good luck on this one...

Their website has you check your thermostat's wiring and wiring at the furnace equipment, which I passed both tests. I bought these thinking I would be good to go. A little to my dismay after trying to install these and them not working, Ecobee told me my zone board wasn't compatible.

Several people I knew had the Nest and liked its functionality, but my big concern was that no matter how smart that thermostat was, it still was only smart in one location of my home. With a three story home where room temperatures can vary significantly between the bottom and top levels I decided to test the Ecobee out with its multiple room sensors. I'll admit I was a bit skeptical as to whether it would actually work effectively or not but decided to take the risk. Wow, have I been impressed! There are all kinds of great options with the Ecobee that are probably common with other smart thermostats like setting a schedule around your routine but then the thermostat is smart enough to know when I'm home or not outside of that schedule and it adjusts the temperature accordingly. There is a geofence option that can be set up to set the thermostat to home or away based on your actual location. The programming is smart enough to start warming or cooling your home in time that it's just the right temperature when you arrive home. But my favorite feature is the multiple room sensors. This allows me to select the rooms I want to base the thermostat reading on and it adjusts the temperature based on those rooms. This works perfect in the evening when everyone is on the top level of the home even though the main thermostat is downstairs. With my old ancient thermostat I had to set the desired temperature at several degrees off what I actually wanted at night just to accommodate the temperature differences among the different levels. Now I just tell Ecobee what rooms to look at and the temperature is set for those rooms. It's fabulous! The functionality with Amazon Alexa is good and there have been several firmware updates that have made it work more effectively at recognizing when to reply or to let an Alexa enabled device reply. I'm looking forward to continued improvements to come as the Alexa integrations are built upon. Overall I'm extremely glad I selected Ecobee over the Nest and haven't regretted my decision in the least bit."}

The first and most important differentiating feature of the ecobee is that it doesn't run off of a rechargeable battery, like the Nest. If you lack a C-wire at the thermostat, like many people do even in modern homes, the Nest will look for opportunities between when the HVAC is not running, and complete the circuit at a lower voltage in order to charge the thermostat battery. By completing the circuit at a lower voltage, this is theoretically supposed to prevent the heat and AC from clicking back on, but in practice, it's not very accurate and consequently clicks on and off repeatedly when the Nest attempts to charge itself, thus nearly burning out and ruining the HVAC. Ecobee's solution is way more elegant, and simply reroutes the C-wire power to the G-wire at the thermostat, thus providing a continual, steady source of 24v power. In addition to the design, the interface is super intuitive and full featured. Matches and exceeds Nest in a lot of areas in terms of customization of schedules, power monitoring and system management. Nest also lacked remote sensors, which was key because temperatures in different rooms within the HVAC zone are often quite a bit different. Also, an Amazon Alexa is built right into thermostat! Value of this unit is really unmatched, don't think twice if you're looking for a next-gen, fully featured, nearly universally compatible, and most importantly reliable smart thermostat!"}

As smart thermostat, works really well. My house is three floors, so it tends to turn on the fan relatively often to even out the temperature, in that respect, the extra sensor is really great. The LCD is usefull, weather forecast is useful. their applications to see your use is pretty interesting.\n\nthe microphone and speaker are not great, but they are good enough to issue a few commands. Alexa is a nice bonus, just be aware that some things won't work, It only has one wake up word for example (Alexa). On the other hand, timers will show up in the LCD, so that is nicer than most alexa speakers. So, it sits in an odd place in the Alexa hierarchy. Voice controlled home automation works great."}

I don't know but it isn't an Ecobee4.\n\nHere's the long and the short of it. The Ecobee4 is slightly larger than an Ecobee3, and uses a different mount, you will not be able to swap out an Ecobee3 with and Ecobee4 without rewiring the mount, so that's out. As far a thermostat functionality is concerned it is identical to the Ecobee3, the setup, all the options such as schedules, hold and HomeIQ are identical. If you're familiar with and like the Ecobee3's thermostat functions you'll be right at home.\n\nNow for Alexa-Enabled, it is but only sort of.\n\nFor some reason Ecobee did not include Bluetooth in the Ecobee4. Why? I don't know. I do a lot of stuff with Raspberry Pi's and have several Raspberry Pi ZeroWs. The ZeroW is a single board computer with a 1Ghz processor, 512M RAM, WiFi, Bluetooth and programmable GPIO ports all for a whopping $10. Raspberry Pi accomplishes this with a single chip that does both WiFi and Bluetooth, why didn't Ecobee use this? I don't know, but it limits the functionality of the device without a huge savings in cost.\n\nIf that wasn't enough my Alexa app doesn't recognize the Ecobee4 as a device available for multi room music. I can play music on the Ecobee4 and the on board speaker is equivalent to the one found on the Echo Dot, which is similar to what you'd find on a transistor radio, but I can't include the Ecobee4 in a mult-room-music group. So no playing the same music all over the house. As for all other Alexa features? Those seem to work. I can get my flash report, it can manage my smart home devices and do all the other stuff I've come to expect from Alexa. If you can be satisfied without Bluetooth pairing and multi-room-music then this may be enough.\n\nBased on my experience, you're better off buying an Ecobee3 Lite and an Echo Dot, you'll have a much better experience. If you need the extra room sensor, right now it's cheaper to buy the Ecobee4 than the Ecobee3, but what's cheaper still (if you want 2 room sensors) is to buy an Ecobee3 lite, a sensor 2 pack, and a Dot and have all the functionality of the Ecobee and all the functionality of Alexa.\n\nPros:\nThermostat identical in operation to Ecobee3\nBuilt in Alexa\n\nCons:\nDifferent mount from Ecobee3\nNo Bluetooth\nLimited Alexa functionality"}

I just finished installing it, it went about as smooth as anyone could ask with current technology. The web application on ecobee's website is very clean and worked flawlessly. I got Alexa hooked up with ease after completing the online setup. Unlike some of the video's in reviews I've seen online at Amazon - Alexa appears to have zero problem hearing or understanding me and I am often accused of mumbling. I haven't lived with it yet, so I reserve the right to come back and update this review but at this time I'm knocked out.\n\nSo my nits (none of which is bad enough to merit taking away a star).\n(1) COMPLAINT: Installation - with the exception of connecting the power conditioner to where my old thermostats lines terminated, it went with ease. There is one part where you connect the power line conditioner to the terminal block and it says to connect all lines with the matching one. Given my thermostat was a 4 wire and there were 5 wires on the power conditioner (and they match the same color codes), it seemed to me obvious that you didn't connect the 5th line especially as it was labeled differently than the terminal block. The manual gave no notes.. so not doing this I had to call in to ecobee for help.\n(2) ATTABOY!: Ecobee's support was A1. I got thru in about 3-4 minutes. I may have been lucky but this may be normal. I had to shoot a few pictures with my phone and email them (reasonable request IMO). They were located in the US and I could understand them, they were polite and knew of what they were talking about.\n(3) ATTABOY!! They contacted me within about 5 minutes of sending them and told me to connect the 5th wire and where to. I connected it as instructed and everything worked just fine.\n(4) ATTABOY!! The rest of the setup was flawless.. really well documented and really well explained. There really is a bunch to setup, it is easy, but don't try to do it when you are in too much of a rush. Between the online stuff and setting up the thermostat for the first time I would give it about an hour.\n(5) ATTABOY & COMPLAINT: Alexa connected without effort, but as noted previously has limitations. Amazon's Audible works! And it sounds pretty good, it would be decent for a small room. But here is the bummer.. (AHHHHHH.. Spotify doesn't work!! Ahhh THE HUMANITY !!!)\n(6) COMPLAINT: Only iPhone Support I see.. Which is ridiculous as only a minority of phones are iPhones. It's because all the marketing weenies aren't smart enough to know how to use a real phone."}

I was instructed to plug in a wire that my nest didn't use. When that didn't work, I called back and got what I would almost have to say is the rudest customer service rep I have dealt with in at least a year. It wasn't enough that they had me crawl into the attic to verify the wire was connected to both sides, but she actually argued with me that it must be broken and asked me to go out and buy a multimeter to test it. After several tries to explain to her it was connected properly, I finally decided to unhook the Ecobee and hook my nest back up. Guess what? It worked perfectly. I did finally go get a multimeter, to find that the wires they were insisting were bad did in-fact carry the 24v current. A few hours after boxing it all back up and processing the return from Amazon, I got a email from support telling me they had marked my issue as solved, so I responded telling them it was not solved and I was returning the item. I then got a reply back from the customer service telling me that my wire was damaged and arguing that the problem was not the thermostat and telling me I should not have rated that I was unsatisfied.\n\nI would have probably just replaced the defective one, except their customer service was appalling and rude and killed the entire experience for me."}

We don't even use half of the house throughout the day so I don't want it running all the time. I wanted a thermostat to run 3 times a day for a few hours. The old manual ones can only run twice a day. I also wanted the Alexa app to set timers for my kids so they know when it is time to leave for school, etc. I looked at both the Nest and the Ecobee3. We decided on the Ecobee4 because of the sensor feature and it was compatible with iPhones (which we only have apple in the house). My husband was easily able to install the thermostat to the wall. He had a little trouble in the attic because the C wire wasn't connected so it took some trouble shooting, so just make sure you have the C wire connected in both places. I am the \"tech\" of the house so once it was up and running I was able to program everything. I have read some of these reviews and no offense, but if you are not a techy person you probably shouldn't get one of the new thermostats. Programing all the times took me a few tries to understand the format. Also, I had programmed the heat to come on at 6am, 15 mins before we wake up. When the heat started to go on at 5:45am and waking me up early I googled it and quickly realized I needed to turn off the setting that starts the temperature early to make sure the thermostat is at 67 degrees at 6am.\n\nAlexa works great for us!! I have no idea why people say she doesn't respond. We have ours in a hall so it is quite, but Ecobee Alexa works just as great at the Echo dot. When reading the other reviews I think it really comes down to if you are handy and can easily fix things around the house, you shouldn't have a problem to install the Echobee and if you are used to new technology you shouldn't have a problem navigating all the intricate settings this thermostat can do!\n\nWe have another old thermostat in the front of the house I will replace with an Ecobee4 because I am so impressed with this one! I just filled out my $50 rebate on PG&E.com! So this thermostat is even cheaper once you factor that in."}

First I currently only have 1 zone in the house with the thermostat located centrally in an open dining room/kitchen. This is an ideal spot for being able to utilize its Alexa capabilities. With that said Alexa is far inferior to an Amazon Echo. For starters, the microphone is sub par on the unit requiring me to speak \u201cloudly.\u201d This poses a bigger problem because by speaking loudly it will compete with other Echos in the house when asking it to perform a task. This is extremely annoying as I am forced to hear two echos going at the same time. It has not adopted Amazons technology which allows the closest echo to only respond. This is a huge limitation. Amazon currently does not allow 3rd party hardware to change the wake word. I figured out a work around for this. Instead of changing my wake word on the Ecobee I changed my wake word on my Echo dots. Now they no longer compete, and it has made the experience significantly better. Set up was really easy. I have a two wire heating only system. I have experience with electrical and was able to run a C wire using an external transformer. It works flawlessly. Setting up the software on the ecobee was easy to follow and the system was up and running in a snap. Also setting up the room sensors took less than 15 seconds. The thermostat discovered them immediately. I like being able to see the temperatures in other rooms. I\u2019ve been using it now for the last few days, and I have noticed that the furnace stays on and the ambient temperature goes approximately 1-2 degrees over the set temperature. I will continue to monitor this as this could pose a problem with energy efficiency. I guess a work around(which for $200 I shouldn\u2019t have to do) would be to set the temp 1-2 degrees lower. Overall I like the thermostat. I\u2019m thinking that I could have gone with the ecobee3 as the Alexa capabilities have not met my expectations. For that I have to give this rating a 3. Of course if there are some firmware changes down the road this may change my rating."}

I was using the Trane XL950 before (a $500 plus thermostat specifically to communicate with the piece of junk 5 year old Trane AC unit). I suffered with a very poor HVAC as well as a very expensive and crappy Trane thermostat to try and run it. My HVAC contractor recommended Ecobee over the Nest. Both were options for me but I went with their recommendation.\n\nFast forward to today. My new AC system is running fantastic and the Ecobee runs circles around the old Trane high end thermostat.\n\nThings I love about the Ecobee 4 in no particular order\n\n1) iOS app connectivity. I think the apps are very polished and functional on both the iphone and ipad. The ipad does let you get more analytics from the Ecobee and hopefully they bring that functionality to the iphone (or android phone) apps soon. Overall the app is easy to use and allows all the necessary functions\n\n2) Web interface. Again very easy to use and offers plenty of functionality and informatino.\n\n3) The look of the Ecobee is pleasing on the wall and the display is crisp and clear.\n\n4) It has a remote sensor you can put in any room(s) and the ecobee can use those to average temps as it's target. I put one in the bedroom.\n\n5) Built in Alexa with ESP now. I have 3 full size alexa's in the house and having one on the wall in our hallway is nice. It won't do everything such as play Spotify but will provide with most of the functionality of Alexa from what I've found so far.\n\n6) Lots of power features on the thermostat itself in the Settings. I run a 5 stage AC, 5 stage heat pump and auxiliary natgas driven heat on this one system. The Ecobee is configured to handle all of it. You can even set it so you can either run the aux heat with or without the heat pump if you have such a setup.\n\nThe above is not a full overview of what the Ecobee 4 can do but is some of the highlights I like about it. When I am ready to replace my downstairs HVAC I will be installing another Ecobee to pair with it. The current system on lower level requires a proprietary communicating thermostat and not sure if Ecobee can handle every vendor specific communicating type system."}

Our house is a Siri/HomeKit setup and so one of the interesting features has been the ability to set triggers and actions based on motion sensors in the various rooms (the remote sensors act as HomeKit motion sensors).\n\nThe Alexa (at least to me) seems to be more of a gimmick. She has a hard time even recognizing the activation prompts from across the room (and I've seen Echo devices do fine with this) - something I actually attribute partly to the trim ring we had to install. There are also some HomeKit integration issues which I assume will be cleared up with future updates, most notably if HomeKit sets a \"comfort setting\" (e.g. Away, Sleep) the thermostat doesn't resume the schedule at the next slot. Maybe I'm missing a setting.\n\nStill, looks great, functions well, and a breeze to set up. Highly recommended!"}

{"Author": "David J.", "Date": "on November 15, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Amazingly smart and simple thermostat with Alexa", "Text": "Installation:\nFirst off, you MUST go to ecobee's website to make sure your thermostat is compatible. This made my life so much easier. Unboxing was easy, and the installation manual is top notch. You really just need to follow it, page by page, and it's very easy to install. I was lucky and had the power wire, so I got to avoid the extra steps; but they go into a ton of detail on how to install it that way too!\n\nYou have 2 options when installing; 1) Place over existing location of old thermostat (which would have meant spackle / sand / paint or 2) use the shiny white large plate to go around the area and sit the ecobee right in the middle. I went with option 2. It definitely makes the ecobee seem a lot larger, but I was really lazy and the white actually went with my wall color really well.\n\nOne thing I recommend after you have installed the ecobee and are doing setup, make sure to write down the activiation number. My computer wasn't near the ecobee and I found it a nuisance to run over to get the code. I know, first world problems, but it was still annoying.\n\nActivation\nAgain, refer to the last note I made. Aside from that, I used my iPhone to hookup the ecobee to my wifi. It was really simple and I had no issues connecting right away. The ecobee basically guides you through every single step. It was seemless! You will need to create an account to activate / register your device.\n\nPairing Sensors\nI recommend pairing sensors 1-by-1. Once you remove the plastic insert on the back, it pairs instantly. Which is horrible when you have 3 sensors and are trying to name each one. I wish each sensor had some ID on it that showed up on the ecobee so I knew which one I was pairing. Instead I had to remove batteries from 2 of them, set a name for the sensor (which room I placing it), and then repeat 2 more times. Again, I know, first world problems, but still annoying.\n\nI did have some issues initially with the sensors cutting out, but I am chalking that off to trying to pair 3 sensors at once. They now work and pair just fine, with my one sensor being 2 stories above the base unit.\n\nUsage\nUsing the ecobee is ridiculously easy. The touchscreen is very responsive and interface easy to navigate. My friend has a different smart thermostat and it's nowhere as user friendly.\n\nAlexa\nI have been toying with doing a smart home for a while, but couldn't figure out what base unit to go with. I really didn't want an Echo, but I am really tied into the Amazon ecosystem. But I HATE how the Echo looks. I really hate how all of them look; Apple, Google and Samsung as well. So when I learned this served as an Echo, granted not the newest one with the built-in HUB, I was sold. I basically got a free Echo in this purchase, without the eye-soar. I absolutely love Alexa, and sorry Siri, but Alexa is so much more helpful. I literally went from \"Hey Siri\" all of the time to \"Alexa...\" in a matter of 2 days. However, Alexa commands are not always as intuitive as Siri, but potato - potahtoh I guess.\n\nSmart Adjustments\nSo far it's been doing an amazing job adjusting to the conditions of the house with the help of the sensors. It took less than a week for it to adapt and now my house feels virtually the same temperature no matter what time of day it is. In addition, I hear my heater kicking on a lot less now, so I am looking forward to seeing my utility bill.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI love the ecobee4! It's smart, easy to use, and has Alexa. I know if hooks into other devices like home humidifiers and other things, but I don't have any of those, so I can't really comment on them. It also can pair with ecobee3, but I am not sure how that works either, since I don't have one. Really happy with this purchase though."}

It tells you when you need maintenance. And if you're hot you just go to the app and change the temperature settings. It's really easy. Necessary? No. But to me it's like getting a universal remote.

I\u2019ve installed all our previous \u201csmart\u201d thermostats but the Ecobee has a lot more going on. Fortunately, it turned out to be an easy install. There was some confusion on my part because it requires power and I thought I would have to run a new power line but a quick email to Ecobee support and they let me know I\u2019d be fine with my existing wires. (yay!)\n\nEasy to use: The interface is intuitive to me and definitely a big step up from our old programmable. The feature to detect when we are away and put it into power saving mode is amazing. A few nice perks like having a reminder when it\u2019s time to change the AC filter just add to my likes.\n\nRemote Sensors: I was initially skeptical about these. I picked up two more in addition to the one that was included. Placing them in strategic locations around the house gave us pretty good coverage to determine the temperatures around the house. While I admit I was a skeptic, they actually do work. My home office during the day is so much more comfortable during the summer but we don\u2019t waste power getting this one room cool when nobody is in there.\n\nCons:\nAlexa: Sorry, I\u2019m just not impressed with Alexa. Alexa *constantly* thinks one member of the household or another is saying its name. It\u2019s constantly waking up and listening in. I know that systems like this can work better because I\u2019ve used them. Additionally, when Alexa does correctly figure out that you\u2019re trying to talk to it, it\u2019s uses are limited. You can install additional \u201cskills\u201d but even then I\u2019m not as impressed as with others\u2019 default systems."}

The device also seems to respond more quickly. For this reason I updated my rating to 4 stars. I cannot give 5 stars because it is necessary to send an e-mail with your Ecobee serial number to Ecobee Support who will then push an update to your device. Since I have two devices I had to submit two separate requests. These devices are registered to the Ecobee web and Android app so they know all about them.

A number of ecobee4 owners are having wifi connectivity issues. Some new buyers (me) cannot connect, and others who have been able to connect are having issues with frequent wifi disconnections. The forums out there on the web are full of posts. I originally chose the ecobee over Nest and Honeywell because of the sensor and because, unlike the nest, you can run the fan independently, on override. I bought the ecobee4, installed it, and then attempted to connect to wifi. My wifi was/is working, my iPhone and other devices is/were connected. Dozens of attempts to connect to wifi failed. I called ecobee Customer Support who answered quickly. They led me thru the usual suspects---try connecting again; unplug and reconnect ecobee from the wall; unplug the router and re-start; turn off other devices connected to home wifi. We were able to connect thru personal hotspot on my iPhone so connection possible. When there was continued failure to connect to home WiFi, the Rep told me to call my internet provider and get them to issue a static IP address rather than dynamic IP. I was not happy with that but I called. The internet provider said it was limiting to go to static IP address and why was I letting a 250 dollar device dictate things when they are working for everything else. Then, the internet provider said to talk to router company. I have a Cisco dual band (with ecobee 4, if dual band, you need to use 2GHz [rather than 5Ghz]). I did call them, just to dot the I'd and cross the t's. Now, things were getting ridiculous--everything except ecobee4 connects to wifi in my house. I researched online and this wifi failure-to-connect is a real problem, as is the problem others have had where they can connect but then the device loses connectivity not infrequently. Other than the static IP address for my problem of not being able to connect at all, there seems to be no other workaround right now. For those with the problem of often losing connectivity, there are a couple of workarounds. One is to set a regular test-ping to make sure and to keep ecobee online; the other is to get ecobee tech staff to disable the wifi power-save chip inside the ecobee. For the latter, ecobee regular tech support will laugh at you and will not know what you are talking about--to do it, your need to escalate up the technical support chain. So, the long and the longer of this is: I am returning my ecobee because it is utterly ridiculous that I can connect every other device I possess to wifi but not the ecobee which was designed to do that very thing; I do not need a 250 buck unable-to-connect-to-WiFi wifi thermostat that I have to \"work around.\" Remember, this review is just for me and my particular problems. Obviously, there are a lot of others who do not have these problems and the ecobee 4 works fine."}

As for the thermostat itself, I love it. It's not auto-learning like a Nest. Instead, it is meant to be programmable and to integrate into a smart home environment or work stand alone. The ability to add remote sensors to the system so it's reading the temperature where I want it when I want it is awesome. I have mine set so it only goes off the temperature of the bedroom sensors during the Sleep comfort mode while it goes off the average of the sensors that detect a presence in the room during the Home mode. If it weren't for the expectation of Alexa, I'd give it a 5 star rating!\n\nAlexa wasn't the best built-in feature though. Compared to my Echo Dot, the voice pickup is poor so half the time, over half the time it doesn't hear the \"Alexa\" cue. Other times, it responds to things on TV that are completely unrelated resulting in a thermostat telling me \"I don't know that\" at random times. I've muted the mic on mine to disable the feature.\n\nIf I had it to buy again, I'd definitely get an Ecobee 3 and buy additional remote sensors. They're the best smart home thermostat and wirelessly accessible thermostat I've owned. That being said, don't get hyped up on Alexa being built in. Get an Echo or Echo Dot for a better Alexa appliance that can still do all the same things with your thermostat and smart home."}

I have Alex intergrated with my lights and it works great !\n\nTHERMOSTAT:\n\nWhen i first set it up, i did not like that it would only heat to 79 degrees. It also would not kick on my AUX heat until after several minutes. I could not find on website any fixes for these and i was pretty disappointed. However, I called tech support and they showed me on the settings how to correct these issues i was having. Now the thermostat works great and exactly how i want. Tech support is fantastic.\nThe thermostat had way more configurations and options then my Nest did. Also, sometimes it is better to set certain things up on the website and not the thermostat. That is just a personal preference. Ive had Honeywell and Nest thermostats. This one in my opinion is better."}

After recently moving into a larger 2-story home with dual zone heating, I didn\u2019t hesitate to grab 2 ecobee 4\u2019s for each zone. I am an early adopter of many smart home products and having Alexa built into my thermostat was very appealing.\n\nHowever, there is an inexcusable flaw with the ecobee 4. When you use Alexa any other Echo, ecobee, or dot will respond AT THE SAME TIME.\n\nThis makes Alexa unusable if you have an Echo, dot, or another ecobee 4 in your home.\n\nAmazon includes an algorithm called ESP to prevent their products from doing this. Amazon has not given this algorithm to third parties for use. So ecobee could not implement it.\n\nWhy implement Alexa into a product when it\u2019s behavior is fundamentally flawed in combination with any other Alexa product the user owns? It makes both companies look bad.\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you own an Echo, Dot, or any other Alexa built product, buy an ecobee 3.\n\nIf you require 2 thermostats, do not buy two ecobee 4\u2019s. Buy an ecobee 4 and an ecobee 3. Unless you own an Alexa product. Then, buy two ecobee 3\u2019s.\n\nIf you don\u2019t own an Alexa product and don\u2019t own an ecobee, this is great.

(I even have a Echo Dot in my car.) So, when I was looking for a smart thermostat, I naturally was excited to find out with Alexa voice services built in.\n\nMy warning is not to buy an Echobee4 if that is also your goal. (Built in Echo-Enabled voice assistant features.) Basically, coming from a real Amazon Echo to this unit, one most likely will be disappointed.\n\nThat is, knowing what a 'real' Echo works like, this thermostat consistently ignores the wake word. Even if one gets it to respond to commands, they are delayed and a lot of times not enacted, compared to other Echo devices on the same WiFi and internet connection. Just in case the thermostat was in a bad WiFi spot, I changed it to the over WiFi that covers my home. (With the same bad results)\n\nI suggest you do not buy this item for it's Echo functions. It's a poor imitation, down a path of frustration. Like Alexa's hard-of-hearing, stubborn sister. One has to repeat their self to her, and watch flashing blue lights in frustration as she did not complete the task. Frankly, I am surprised Amazon approved the use of Alexa for use in this unit. It cheapens the value of all Echos, if the Ecobee4 is a customers first experience with this voice assistant.\n\nUnfortunately with a device like this, once it is installed, one is mostly stuck it with, poor performance or not. I debated at giving this more stars for it's other functions, but I am left with a bad feeling over the whole thing, knowing it lurks on the wall with poor voice performance."}

I originally bought a Lyric T5 and it was horrible. I was never even able to get the Lyric to connect to their app. After 3 attempts with their customer care, I returned it and bought the ecobee4. The Ecobee4 is decades ahead of the Lyric. It took me 5 minutes to install it and another 5 minutes to have Alexa up and running. Super simple set-up instructions.\n\nThe reason I only gave this 4 stars is that Alexa doesn't work very well. I have an echo and an echo dot. The echo is in the kitchen and the echo dot is my bedroom. The ecobee4 is in the dining room, which is open to the living room and my bedroom is connected to the dining room. When I'm in the living room the ecobee4 can not hear me. My echo dot, three rooms over (with the door closed) can hear me and will respond! The only time the ecobee Alexa will respond is when I'm standing directly in front of it. What's the point of Alexa if you have to get up to use it? I'm hoping a software update or something will fix this in the future.\n\nI would recommend this to my friends, however, I'd probably tell my friends to skip the Alexa part and just get the Ecobee3. You'll save more then enough money to buy an echo dot, which is basically what this is trying to be. The concept is great and if it functions better in the future I'd definitely give this 5 stars.\n\n****Update December 11, 2017 - I love the room sensor that comes with the unit! When I'm asleep it allows me to set the furnace based off the sensor, which is in my bedroom. My bedroom is typically warmer than where the thermostat is located so it helps me save on running my furnace when I'm already warm. Living in WI, anything that helps the furnace stay off helps!\n\nI saw the response from Ecobee to do the update for Alexa to work better. I've had Alexa turned off on the Ecobee since I wrote this review, so I'll try the update and give it a go."}

I've long since wanted a better way than straining to see and set schedules in an old black & white LCD under hallway lighting, and having to cycle through every interval to set. This is finally something you can program on your phone, or from your PC or laptop on a browser with an easy to read schedule for the week, or set directly on the little touch-screen. But it is so much more than just that. The remote sensor means that it can keep the room temperature where you actually are, not just in the hallway by the thermostat. You can have the app remind you to change the filter (which I never do because I don't get reminded in a convenient way). It has Alexa built-in, so it is effectively another Echo Dot mounted on the wall. It has weather right on it, if you want to see it instead of just asking Alexa. But really, it comes down to convenience, see and set from anywhere.\n\nIt was quite easy to install. It only took me a while because I was being so careful & deliberate. The instructions it comes with are really easy to follow. You can check for wiring compatibility before you buy from their website. When I ordered, it said mine was compatible, but when I received it and read the instructions, it said to contact them. I only have 2 wires for my heater (I don't have AC or humidifier). You really need a \"Common\" wire. But that is easily solvable without having to run a new wire. Their email support just sent me a wiring diagram and said I needed a FAST-STAT Common Maker. It just makes 2 wires into 3 (also available in a number of other wire counts to add a wire or two virtually). It basically gives you a dongle on both ends that converts 2 wires actually in the wall to 3 wires to connect to the thermostat & furnace.\n\nThe screen is not especially bright. It is powered through the normal thermostat wiring, so that probably isn't surprising. It is remarkable that it can connect over wifi and do what it does on that old thermostat wire connection. I thought the built-in weather was going to be great, but once you have Alexa built-in, just save the steps to walk over to it and just say \"Alexa Weather\" :) , which is what I do anywhere else in my house with Echo Dots anyway."}

I called customer service who insisted I remove the current thermostat and connect the new one myself or tell them how many volts of power was coming into the line. Suggested only option was to dispose (at my cost) and get a new one. The ecobee 4 which we did get to work has a clunky interface which after a number of uses remains an entirely unfamiliar user experience. This thing was supposed to make things easier, far from it. Save yourself time, money and trouble and DO NOT BUY. Going to look at Nest or other options or make just stick with current old school thermostat. Other smart home devised work well, but not this."}

Why you ask would I want that, because of its location in the entry hallway, it makes it duplicate every other command in the house that I ask my other \"Alexa\" devices in the house like Grocery list requests are duplicated, music requests are spoken the often canceled because you cannot have music streaming on 2 devices according to Alexa. It is very annoying to the point I am having to try to find other areas to place my Echo's so Echobee will stop hearing my other requests, I dislike having to whisper to my Echo's so the thermostat will not respond. If I was able to change the wake work to Dot or Computer like other Echo devices, it would have to hear that command to awake.\n\nIf this is the only device you will own as an Alexa device, great, but be warned if you have many in your house you might get annoyed by the lack of wake weird change or Mic sensitivity control."}
{"Author": "Manderz604", "Date": "on September 19, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Truly a Smart Thermostat and the Home IQ System Monitor is the best feature!", "Text": "I debated between the Nest and the Ecobee, and I don't regret my decision for the Ecobee4 with Alexa. Once programmed and after a few days of minor adjustments to comfort settings, I don't ever touch it - and that is the real intention of smart technology. After going through every menu and not having to touch it for weeks, I found it a little anti-climactic. Then I logged into the ecobee website and the Home IQ System Monitor is incredible. Seeing the graphs of when the fan kicks on, how long it cooled (or heats), plotted with the outside temperature, and even which sensor triggered the action is by far the best feature. All with no monthly fee! I can't emphasize the website enough!\n\nComing from a 20 year old beige thermostat, the Ecobee was much smaller than I anticipated, and the optional wall plate (included) barely covered the existing hole in my wall. The screen is smaller than I imagined as well - the touch portion is about 2 inches wide by 3 inches down - and covers only half the total area of the front. The iPhone app is nearly an identical look and feel as standing right in front of the thermostat (but it's much more crisp on the iPhone screen).\n\nI have other \"smart\" equipment, and connected Alexa and Samsung Smarthings to the Thermostat - but haven't needed to set any routines to control the ecobee. The algorithms in the ecobee are fantastic all by themselves, and I don't need to tell it when I leave the house or go to sleep, it already knows from its sensor data and adjusts itself according to the comfort settings for Home, Away, or Sleep mode.\n\nThe vacation scheduling feature is nice, so that you let your ecobee know well in advance when you're planning to be gone, so that you don't have to \"check\" that box on your way out the door. But even if you forget to set Vacation mode, it'll go into Away mode with no humans triggering the ecobee sensors in the house. Vacation mode has a much wider temperature range so that the system runs even less than Away mode. My main motivation for purchasing a Wifi thermostat was to control it remotely from my phone. However, the ecobee is so smart, I don't ever need to!\n\nOne annoyance, the thermostat is mounted about 10 feet from an Echo dot, and when both are listening - they both respond. And the voice recognition on the Ecobee is slightly poorer, so the responses from the ecobee aren't quite as accurate. The ecobee does not have bluetooth and will not do Pandora, so it's not a full \"echo\" replacement. Instead, I have the ecobee always muted which means the blue light turns red and is always on - not quite the ambiance I was intending. Instead, I wish I could toggle the soft touch mic icon as a Push-to-Talk mic only and ditch the red light.\n\nPros:\nGreat algorithms for keeping the house comfortable\nHome IQ data on ecobee.com is incredible\nCan be a great \"Alexa\" addition for a room or hallway that doesn't already have one\n\nCons:\nIs not a complete Echo replacement\nNo Pandora\nNo Bluetooth\nConstant red light when mic is muted"}

Its awesome to have Alexa in your thermostat, but Alexa is garbage without the magic amazon Mic tech. My Echo can hear me perfectly almost anywhere in my home because the mic tech is so amazing, but this thermostat only really understands me when I'm right in front of it practically yelling at it. You will not be replacing your Echo with this.\n\n2.) You can set your thermostat to either cool, heat, off, or auto. The auto setting turns on the heat when its too cold and turns on the AC when its too warm. Great, lots of thermostats do that, but this one forces you to accept a minimum temperature range of 5 degrees F. I am sorry but the difference between 68 and 73 degrees is pretty huge! Relaxing at 68 degrees is too cold, doing laundry and cleaning at 73 is too warm. Now, look, I understand that the ecobee is trying to be economical, its right in the product name after all, but do you know what would be most economical? Not having AC at all. It should let me choose any temperature range and attempt to maintain that range most efficiently. This 5deg bs is so frustrating!"}

For starters the Nest thermostat isn't ideal if you live in a two story home. The reason being is that it's sensors will detect the temperatures in its immediate area. As a result of this my bottom floor where the thermostat was would be cool but my upstairs would still be pretty warm due to it's proximity to the Nest. Ecobee solved the issue by offering me the ability to add extra sensors around the house in order to get a more accurate temperature. How does that benefit you if you're wondering? Well the unit will continue to do it's job basically until the whole house is at pretty much the same temperature. So now my whole house is pretty consistent which makes being upstairs a lot more bearable. The reason i only rate it 4 stars is because while it does come with Alexa, it's not nearly as responsive as having an independent unit. Not to mention that if you have your thermostat in the hallway it won't hear you from the living room unless you yell. So for the price it's not quite worth having the dual function and unless you're the type that needs to have the latest and greatest then perhaps go with the Ecobee3.

{"Author": "Eyeball-ologist", "Date": "on August 27, 2017", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Nice!", "Text": "Overall I'm happy with this purchase. I WAS disappointed with shipping. First time I ordered, missing parts (no wall plates or screws, plus a defective sensor). Second time I got an Ecobee 3 lite...?!?! What?!? Neither time was there an option to \"send a replacement\". (In the past, I had a defective product and Amazon expedited shipping on a replacement. No luck here. The second and third time I ordered it, the price had gone up slightly. That was annoying.) Third time was a charm.\n\nHad to hook up a C-wire. My system already had one, just not hooked up at either end, so not too difficult. Set up was fairly easy.\n\nNow for Alexa... she's on the Ecobee, but can't operate it by default... Annoying/weird, but whatever. You have to activate it. Ok... still not working. Oh wait, you have to add the Ecobee skill. It's cumbersome to figure out, but finally works... but try saying anything more complicated than \"set thermostat to 73 degrees\" is too complicated for Alexa. Turns out in order to set \"Comfort Settings\" (home, away, resume normal, etc.) you have to add \"ecobee PLUS\" skill (not the plain-Jane \"ecobee\" skill). Why not just have one skill?!\n\nEcobee plus with Alexa works better than Siri with Homekit. Siri can tell you info and set temp, but can't say \"I'm home\" or \"resume schedule\"... (oddly enough, saying I was \"leaving home\" did set it to \"away\" though... so maybe I wasn't saying it right. I could not get it to go back to \"home\" mode with Siri or resume normal schedule.)\n\nAlexa can play music, so that's neat. I haven't had experience with Echo dot, so I can't compare to that. Sound quality is decent, actually better than I expected from such a small speaker. Microphone pick up is somewhat less impressive, I have to get fairly close (~10 feet), and by then I may as well use my finger to adjust it. (I have tall ceilings in a wide hall so it's quite echoy/good reverb. This might contribute to better sounding speaker, but more difficulty hearing my voice.)\n\nBeing able to check and set temp from phone app or online is cool. I forgot to set it \"Away\" and was able to do it a few seconds later.\n\nHomeKit and Ecobee have different naming schemes it seems and it's confusing to know what you're looking at in HomeKit. Like the extra room sensor is 2 sensors (temp and motion). (My first sensor didn't work, always read 32 degrees, greyed out, but could detect motion.)\n\nOverall, cool thermostat. I hope it helps with heating an cooling costs. (Setting up a schedule is really straight forward on it. MUCH better than some of the less-smart thermostats I've used.)"}

Sometimes the television will say something that sounds something remotely close to \"Alexa\" and set it off. We find that slightly humorous from the SNL skit \"Echo Silver\". Sometimes the Alexa light will even flash if I'm sitting in the room quietly reading a book. Other times, I'll be a few feet away in the same room and try to give it a command but it won't respond at all. Meanwhile my Dot way down the hallway in the bedroom will respond instead."}

Most of the Alexa functionality has been removed and there was no good reason for it. ecobee chose not to put bluetooth in it, so you cannot connect to a speaker, so forget playing music with it. The internal speaker is tiny and faces the wall. It is fine for Alexa to speak, but unusable for music. It cannot perform any messaging functions. It cannot send or check text messages. It cannot check my voicemail. It cannot connect to my brand new Denon bluetooth receiver or many other smart electronics I have. IT can change the channel on my dish, but cannot change the volume. It has so many functions that do not work, more often than not when I ask it to do something, the answer is, this unit does not support that function. I wish I had not wasted the money on this ecobee4 and had just bought an Amazon Echo for $50 and an ecobee3 which are super cheap now. The Echo can do everything I just described. I could even use the Echo to control the ecobee. Also, the ecobee4 microphone is on the back, facing the wall. So if there is any background noise, it does not hear you unless you yell. Also, if you leave the default wakeup word, Alexa will respond to commands on TV commercials. But ecobee does not allow you to change the wakeup word, so your thermostat will now do whatever the TV tells it to do -\nlike set a timer every time an Amazon Echo commercial comes on. It's awesome when you come back in the room and your thermostat is beeping an alarm at you for no reason. Fortunately, Amazon ordering does not work with the ecobee4. Alexa responds to the commercials, \"this unit does not support that function.\" If you want to use Alexa, don't bother with this unit. It's junk for that purpose. I plan on purchasing an Echo and turning off Alexa on my ecobee. It simply is not worth wasting your time to get half the functionality of Alexa."}

I bought it directly from my power company (ComEd) who provided instant rebates for the purchase and I'm happy I did so. I have no background in HVAC, but the product was incredibly easy. I did not have the required \"C\" wire for an easy installation so I had to use the adapter which is included with the thermostat. Installation took about 45 minutes since I had no idea what I was doing (and a day of discomfort as the R(?) wire accidentally came detached after installation due to not being tight enough). Installation of the adapter could not have been easier with the included manual, pictures are provided which also helped.\n\nOverall it's a thermostat that's easy to use. The setup is completely guided by the thermostat itself and some portions are done via smartphone/tablet. Setup took maybe 15 minutes which included a ~10 minute calibration period for the thermostat. No action is needed during this time, it does it all on its own. The app is extremely responsive and I have no complaints.\n\nThe best part for me is the included sensor. I have a differential in temperature between levels in my house, setting up a sensor profile which now uses the sensor in the upstairs instead of the room temperature the thermostat is located in is a complete game changer. This has led to much better sleep for everyone in my household (myself, wife, and children). You can also use these sensors for judging if people are in various rooms and build profiles around that as well which seems like a great feature if you're willing to make the investment in extra sensors.\n\nThe Alexa features are just icing on the cake. The weather forecast has probably been the most utilized feature for me, as the thermostat is not centrally located in a high traffic area, but more of a place where we come and go. Note that this is not a \"full-blown\" Alexa device, I don't know the limits but it was unable to use the SiriusXM feature that other Alexa enabled devices can use.\n\nI am extrermely satisfied with this product, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a smart thermostat."}

In an attempt to make the installation easier, it feels like they've skipped over info and tried to guide me down a very narrow path in an attempt to not confuse me. The problem is, any deviation from that path they've chosen and you are instantly lost. They've tried to adopt the \"it just works\" Apple approach, but the problem with that approach is that the saying usually goes something like, \"it just works...so don't both providing a manual or troubleshooting help.\"\n\nAlexa is also annoying. For the life of me I don't know why they went with Alexa. Google Assistant is clearly superior, but whatever. The setup process for Alexa tells you to ask Alexa to enable the Ecobee skill, but doing that just tells you to go to the Alexa app on your phone. Once again, poor instructions resulting in a product that feels half-baked.\n\nThe scheduling feature is the worst I've ever seen and resulted in numerous bugs. If you're at all familiar with how you set a schedule in just about any other software on the planet (MS Office, for example) that's not the case here. This is how a typical schedule is set in Ecobee. You pick the day, then decide if you want to set it for Sleep, Home, or Away. But what if I want something else? Not an option. Then when I select Sleep for Saturday, it just says \"from Fri\" for the Sleep schedule. WTF DOES THAT MEAN? Man this thing is frustrating. Long pressing on the scheduled item just copies text, which is a sign of some really amateur programming. That was followed closely by jibberish code on the screen, like I was seeing source code when I should be seeing something else. Amateur hour indeed.\n\nI think I may just return it as it's just not worth the price."}

This little unit is a huge success in keeping your energy bills low and helping you monitor your energy costs. I work for a major retailer that sells home improvement products, like thermostats. So when my Honeywell thermostat was fading away, ( it never worked that well - constantly having to get up and adjust temp) I purchased the Ecobee 4 with room sensor ( a sensor to monitor your room's temp ----what a concept!) So before I could change the thermostat, it died! With an outside temperature of 92 Degrees, I knew it would not be a comfortable night. So at 9:15 I opened the box, pre-read the instructions, and dug in attaching the power extender kit to my HVAC unit , which went rather well, then detaching the former thermostat and adding the wiring plate per the easy to use instruction booklet. Once all the wires were in place, I snapped in the Ecobee4 and turned on the HVAC and Voila this thing goes to work analyzing my environment and once I set it up with my wi-fi it made setting it up easy as pie.It was now 10:08 and the house was getting cool. I could'nt believe how quickly it all came together! Big uses for this is how it can be accessed via smart phone, via Alexa, or just by tapping on it. I have showed this unit off to all my friends that come over and you can see the jealousy in their eyes!

I ended up calling customer service and spoke to an incredibly patient representative who talked me through all of the steps to get my system working. He even asked me to take photos of the wires to send to him. Very thorough. Very professional. This is how customer service was meant to be. Within about 45 minutes my Ecobee was up and running. It took me a few days to optimize the location of the sensors in each room. It's important to place them where they have a clear line of sight to any movement. Thus far the system has worked flawlessly. The Alexa interface is very sensitive and easy to hear and understand. I highly recommend the Ecobee4!"}

I do recommend it, you can see it at night. my old one didn't illuminate so I had to turn on the light to see it, and plus the screen was tiny.

{"Author": "Caveat Emptor", "Date": "on July 21, 2017", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Ok, much better than I originally thought", "Text": "Update: 10/11/17\n\nI meant to write this update earlier, but honestly, I forgot I'd written a review of this product. Not sure why, but the first effort at install resulted in a blown fuse on my HVAC. Not happy about the cost to replace the fuse with an HVAC technician visit, but after that hefty cost, the unit (same one) has generally performed as intended. According to the HVAC tech, the blown fuse might (key word: \"might\" ... tech said he couldn't tell for sure) have had nothing to do with the ecobee4 and could have been caused by a short somewhere in the line external to the ecobee unit. After the initial install drama, the unit has been a convenient addition to my home gadgets... for the most part.\n\nThe schedule function took a few tries to figure out, mostly due to the nomenclature used to define the in and out points for each time period, but not that hard once you figure it out. Maybe I'm just a little slow. Could it be my mother lied to me when she told me, \"You is kind, you is smart, and you is important\"? In auto mode it occasionally has a tendency to turn off the HVAC altogether even when the temperature is outside of the target range. That's an easy fix by picking cool or heat in the appropriate season, but it seems one shouldn't have to do that. To me, that's not a huge deal as the auto setting works most of the time. The times my HVAC remained off when it shouldn't have been (if I remember correctly) were during extreme temperatures in the summer, although I'm not sure. It seems to me that shouldn't make a difference in how the ecobee4 triggers the HVAC to respond in auto mode.\n\nThe Alexa function is OK, but it lacks the location feature of Echo products in their ability to recognize each other. It doesn't communicate with other amazon branded Alexa devices as far as which one should respond, so I have to remember to keep my bedroom door shut or the ecobee4 (downstairs hallway) and the Echo Dot (upstairs bedroom) sometimes compete with each other and both answer at the same time. In some cases they conflict when managing other devices via Alexa... \"Alexa, turn TV on\" then ecobee turns it on and says, \"OK\" then echo turns it right back off and says, \"Ok.\" There have been a few times when I had to actually yell, or stand right in front of the ecobee to get Alexa to respond, but most of the time Ecobee Alexa hears me from anywhere downstairs (my place isn't huge). Once in a blue moon, Alexa on the ecobee will freak out and start flashing lights, then say a rather weird unprompted outburst, \"I'm sorry I can't answer that right now\" or \"I'm sorry, I don't know who that is\" or, \"Try back later.\" I'm guessing she's responding to something on my TV, but most of the time there was nothing that even remotely sounded like \"Alexa\" said in the TV show's dialogue, and a time or two I had no TV or radio on when it happened. Maybe my place is haunted and ecobee is communicating with spirits from beyond. As long as she doesn't start ordering me to murder my neighbors or whisper, \"GET... OUT!\" in a super creepy voice, I'm cool with it.\n\nI really appreciate the geo fence function that lets you set a range radius of how close you are to your home (coming or going) detected by the app on your phone via GPS, which prompts ecobee4 to set your preferred \"at home\" comfort temp for you so your place is as you like it before you come in the door. If it weren't for one particular preference of mine, I would have gotten the previous version without Alexa and just purchased another Echo Dot for downstairs. This may be a little OCD, but I bought the ecobee4 over the previous model because I like the newly designed cover plate better. It lost connection to my wifi network once. Support through online chat was instantaneous and the fix was easy (pop it off the back plate to disconnect from wiring and pop it back in). That corrected the problem. If that happens more regularly in the future, my satisfaction level with the unit may change drastically. It has only lost connection once in the time I've had it, which is a better rate than many of my other wifi connected devices. In the modern age of wifi and the internet of things, the occasional lost connection is to be expected. Acceptability of that loss is a matter of degree for individual users. I'd say the ecobee4 competes handily with the Nest, compared to my experience with the ecobee and personal acquaintances recounting their experiences with the Nest. The ecobee is by far, a vast improvement over the old low-tech programmable Trane thermostat that came with the HVAC unit. Despite the abridged Alexa functions compared to an actual Echo device, it is really convenient to ask my walls what time it is, or what the weather is and get a response, just as long as Alexa on ecobee doesn't get any weirder and start Linda Blair-ing green vomit out of my hallway wall.\n\n---------------\n\nWorse than nothing.\n\nTook photos of my old thermostat and hvac wiring and sent to ecobee for compatability evaluation. Got response saying it would work with detailed install instructions. Wired as advised, atached ecobee face plate... got a blank screen. Checked wiring again, was as instructed, still nothing. Reinstalled original thermostat, now that doesn't work either. HVAC is not reponsding. Now I have to go 3 days in 90 degree weather untill HVAC guy can come out and figure out what this stupid ecobee broke. With initial evaluation from repair call plus minimum hourly charge I'll be lucky to get back where I was before this piece of garbage blew up my HCAC for 300 bucks minimum. Avoid it like the plague."}

Good functionality, easy setup, HomeKit compatibility, and built in Alexa make this thermostat an easy choice over the others. It monitors and regulates the temperature well with thought out integrated features and external sensors.\n\nCons:\n-Ecobee's Alexa is not compatible yet with all skills normally associated with Alexa products. For example, it won't play Pandora or Sirius XM. Not sure why. Hopefully full functionality will be enabled in the future.\n-The battery life on the sensors is terrible. It's been one month since I installed the Ecobee, and already one of the sensor batteries needs replacing. If this can't be helped, at least give us the option to hard plug the sensor into an outlet.\n-The menu interface is not ideal. Some important things are buried deep in poorly labeled sub menus and it needs to be overhauled.\n\nOverall the cons are minor, and without them it would easily warrant 5 stars. I'd also like to see a sync functionality added across paired Alexa devices, such as all devices playing the same song in unison."}

I tried reinstalling the app, but that didn't help. After searching the Internet, it appears this is a widespread issue, and not just me. So today I needed to remotely control my thermostats, so I decided to try the Web app on my Windows laptop. Upon logging in, it immediately kicks back to the login prompt. No error or anything. Thinking it was my password, I reset it. No change, same thing. I've tried multiple browsers as well. Come on Ecobee, get it together. I know issues happen, but this has been going on for weeks. Enough is enough. I own 3 Ecobee4's, and my first experience with their products has been less than impressive. I would recommend anybody looking to purchase one of these thermostats first confirm that these issues have been resolved. This has been going on for weeks.\n\nOriginal Post -\n\nI purchased 3 of these. Alexa built-in is nice. I don't have near the issues with it 'hearing' me like others have mentioned. The speaker for the size of the device in my opinion sounds nice. I don't understand some of these complaints. I have none really. The device itself works great. My biggest gripe is with the schedule override settings. In my previous home, I had Honeywell wireless thermostats. The Honeywell app had a great feature that when you changed the temp, you could on the same screen set the length of time on how long you want the temp to 'hold'. For example, if you only wanted it to hold for 3 hours, you could set it at the same time you set the temp. 3 days? Same deal. With the Ecobee app, when you set the temp, it will hold it until whatever the thermostat default is (ie. 2 hours, 4 hours, next schedule change, permanent or decide at time). There isn't a time-override on the temp screen. You can do a 'quick change' and set it for \"Home for now\" or \"Away for now\", but once again that doesn't give you a way to set a time limit. It should be flexible on the schedule hold times - not forced to pick from just 4 options (2 hrs, 4 hrs, next schedule or permanent) This is a simple design change that for me would make it the perfect thermostat. Also, another app gripe - Why can't it store creds? Do I really have to log into the app every time? Once again the Android Honeywell app gave you the option to save creds, and skip the login. Unless I'm missing it, that's not an option."}

After trying to install the Nest product, which I was unsuccessful at due to a lack of power, this installation went on without a hitch! It was fairly easy to install with the power extender that is included in the price. If you do not have a C wire going to your thermostat, you will need to do a little rewiring at your furnace (of the wires that go to the thermostat). This is much easier than it sounds, mostly just making sure you have the power off ,and disconnecting the four color-coded wires, inserting them into a small device ,and hooking the wires up again. This is needed if you lack those C wire which provides power to your thermostat. If you have a C wire you do not need to worry about this step. The especially nice thing about this is ,previous products required the purchase of a complex box sometimes including separate power cable ,that was needed to be able to hook up. The only caveat that is not addressed online ,or in the manual, is if you have additional wires connected (ie a W2), you just leave them in place as they are , and the thermostat has a place for these as well! What I like most is that this extends my Alexa into my bedroom where the thermostat is located! And includes a remote sensor to sense the temperature at its location ,if you do not want to use the location of the thermostat as far as temperature adjustment. It also has a speaker so you can do your typical Amazon Alexa requests, such as play music, set an alarm, etc. in addition to adjusting your temperature for you by voice. In addition the mobile application is simple and easy to use, and the device connects easily to your wireless network!"}

AND, we don't use Alexa currently so can't comment on that function.\n\nWe love this thermostat. We had two programmable, non wifi thermostats and only the hvac tech really understood how they functioned. Our home was always too cold or too hot or some rooms were too cold or hot. We'd go to bed comfortable and by morning be freezing. I won't name the thermostat but we hated it. The ecobee4 has bee a fantastic replacement thermostat.\n\nThe four biggest benefits for us so far are:\n\n1. It's easy to understand how the ecobee4 works. If something didn't make sense I called tech support and they clarified the information. Their tech support is fantastic. As a result, I fully understand my thermostat and hvac system for the first time ever which leads to better decisions on how the thermostat is set.\n\n2. Comfort settings and schedules allowed us to fine tune our systems. For example, we created comfort and schedule settings that allow us to warm our house slowly in the morning instead of going from a night time temp straight into a day time temp as our old thermostat required.\n\n3. The room sensors help with problem areas. We tell the system to only use the room sensors in our bedrooms at night to ensure our sleeping temp remains comfortable. During the day we use the main sensor and room sensors to avoid hot/cold rooms.\n\n4. We love having a wifi option and the ecobee4 integrates easily with Apple HomeKit. At this point the biggest benefits of wifi are that it makes it easier to monitor the systems which has helped me program them better and that I can remotely keep an eye on the upstairs thermostat where my kids have bedrooms. They aren't supposed to touch the thermostat but somehow the target temp mysteriously changes from time to time and I appreciate being able to remove their changes remotely using my iPhone."}

Also, the sensors know if a room is occupied or not. The problem with our home is the second-floor thermostat is in the hallway which is open to the living room below, so we receive inaccurate temperature readings from that thermostat.

Getting the wiring installed cost more than the thermostat did, but now I'm pretty psyched about the whole thing.\n\nSetup was very fast. The thermostat rebooted (or did it crash? Dunno.) once or twice early on, but it has been up and running for a month and a half with no problems. I was able to set specific days that we were on vacation\u2014much like an Outlook out-of-office setting\u2014so I didn\u2019t even have to think about resetting the thermostat when we returned.\n\nThe additional sensors are key to the thermostat\u2019s functioning. In my old house, some rooms are on different levels, and some just aren\u2019t/can\u2019t be insulated well, so the temperature varies widely. So, I put one sensor in a different room, and the thermostat averages the temperature there and on the actual thermostat. You\u2019d think that that would simply make everyone uncomfortable, but it really works out that both rooms\u2014and by extension, most of the rest of the house\u2014are okay. Of course, if you had a multi-zone setup or perhaps some of those fancy automated vent/duct dampers, this would be even better. And because I can see the sensor status on my phone, I can see if the area around the thermostat and the other room are occupied.\n\nThe Alexa feature is pretty much overkill, though. The whole idea of a smart thermostat is that you set it up and then forget it. While I like techno gadgets as much as\u2014well, more, much more\u2014than the usual person, I don\u2019t really need Alexa to adjust the temperature. After all, I have my phone or tablet, right? And, because the thermostat is in a hallway, I\u2019d either have to get up from wherever I am to go talk to the thermostat, or I\u2019d have to buy a Dot or something to put in other rooms.\n\nAlexa is a little slow on the thermostat, too\u2014I say \u201cAlexa,\u201d then wait a couple beats for it to light up (signifying that it\u2019s ready), and then I can say, \u201cTell me a joke.\u201d The kids liked the jokes\u2014for the first 10 minutes, and now everyone ignores poor Alexa.\n\nEven if Alexa added some cost to the thermostat and is ultimately unnecessary, the device is really, really well done, and the design is extremely elegant. Often it seems that devices that mimic trendsetters--which in this case would be the Nest, of course\u2014cut corners and simply fall short, but in this case, I think the Ecobee is the trendsetter. I couldn\u2019t be happier with it."}

The first one was larger, but a dream to install. My system didn't have a common line, but Ecobee offered the option to plug in a power adapter. Super easy! When I upgraded, well, now they've removed that option. They include some adapter that is supposed to work, but that meant going onto the roof of my complex. Long story short, I just hired someone to run a common wire for me for $300 and call it a day. No biggie.\n\nThe temperature sensor in the thermostat has never been accurate. After many emails back & forth with tech support, I gave up. They insisted it was something wrong with me. No biggie. I just installed remote sensors around the house and again... called it a day.\n\nThe daily annoyance, however, with the ecobee is the UI -- both on the thermostat and in-app. You adjust the temperature by pressing and holding a virtual circle and trying to move it ever so slightly up or down to the right temperature and hope to all that is holy you don't go a hair too high or a hair too low. Every other thermostat uses up & down buttons (including the first ecobee), but this is as if someone decided that they should come up with the single most convoluted way to adjust a temperature on Earth (on this, they succeeded).\n\nThen... simple enough. I needed to change my email address as my roommate and I created an account we both share. Guess what? No way to do that. Your contact information is permanent! That's right, once you create your Ecobee account online, you're committed. Your only option is to create a new account, lose years of history, and reprogram everything from scratch. I'm not even kidding here. Ecobee never contemplated someone might want to change his contact information (note: this is also the email address where you receive all your notifications... it also cannot be changed!)\n\nFrankly, the historical online data and remote sensors are the only reason I still have an Ecobee. If I have to reset and lose all my data, I'll go with Nest. I'm only waiting for them to come out with remote sensors.\n\nAll-in-all, it's a decent product that could be a lot better if the company weren't plagued by an inexplicable lack of foresight and user-friendliness.

{"Author": "BMan", "Date": "on July 8, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Love It So Far!", "Text": "I have had the Ecobee4 for about 1 week now. I did tons of research on it before I bought it, and also looked closely at my wire configurations to make sure I was ready to install when it came in. I even contacted Ecobee support before purchasing to tell them what my current wiring was. They were extremely helpful! The best advice I can give is to have everything sorted out before you order it, so your installation will go smoother...less stress if you wait until the last minute. Also, I never do projects like these on a weekend or holiday in case I need tech support or if I have to call in a service person. I live in Florida so I started the install at about 7 a.m. in the morning. I made sure the house was nice and cool before I shut off the breaker to the heat pump. Although, I was very sure about the wire configuration prior to the set up, I did call Ecobee support to confirm that my white wire did go to W1 on the Ecobee and not W2. My previous thermostat was a Honeywell, and the white wire was connected to W2 on it. The rep e-mailed me an explanation of why the white wire would now connect to the W1. I had Ecobee support on speaker phone while I confirmed the wiring configuration one last time. I am a very handy DIY'er, but electrical stuff is not my strongest skill. You don't have to be an electrician to install the thermostat, but you do want to make sure you are hooking it up correctly. I took my time and it took about 30 minutes from the time I disconnected my old thermostat until the Ecobee was up and running. I did have a C-wire on my unit and did not need the PEK attachment for power.\n\nThis is my first smart device in my home and I love it so far. If you are buying this thermostat, because you want the speaker to sound like a Bose surround sound system or you think Alexa will answer all of your questions, then you are buying it for the wrong reasons. The speaker is adequate for it's size and Alexa will be stumped on some questions. There are a lot of Alexa skills you can set/help her learn, but you have to spend time researching how to do this. This is a thermostat first, not a sound system. The main reason I bought it was because my son's bedroom was always hot due to the location. Since I have a sensor in his room now, he has never complained once about being hot. It takes one month before Ecobee generates a data log for energy usage and system performance, but my power company has very good data on my usage for several years that I can access. I compared the daily usage/temperature now to last year at the same time, and it looks as though I am saving about 20% on average. I think it is still too early to be sure though. I feel like my unit is running more to be able to average the temperature by using the sensors...but maybe I am just more aware of it since I just installed the Ecobee However, the motion detectors on the sensors do not use the sensors in the average if the room is unoccupied. As some others have said in their reviews, the smart recovery feature takes too long and seems to run the unit too long to ensure it meets the correct temperature at the time you have set on the schedule. I disabled it. I'll do another review after I get the first month's data. I did order directly from Ecobee since they had the thermostat and 2 extra sensors for $249...great deal."}

When I first got it, I felt like my house had been upgraded and modernized by a factor of 100%, but over the course of just a few days, the novelty wore off and some frustration began to set in.\n\nThe first- and biggest- issue, for me, is one which may seem off, but it's a glaring omission on behalf of ecobee. And that is the lack of a simple clock. This thing would display inside and outside temperature, forecasts, so on. But there wasn't an option for just a way to tell the time. You can order any number of how many millions of products through it by using Alexa, but when you need to see the time in the middle of the night on your way to the bathroom, there is nothing. And that just felt cheap to me. It felt like a \"try harder\" moment. One could say that you could ask Alexa what the time was, but why not just display the time? It's just such a weird thing to leave out.\n\nSecond issue- The novelty of using your thermostat to stumble your way around Alexa services really gets old. It's not very accurate, it's limited, the speaker- while loud- is rather poor sounding. There were also an unacceptable amount of false Alexa triggers. I stopped using the Alexa feature, for the most part, within just a few days. It was also absolutely mind boggling when you would speak to the thermostat with a command to adjust the temperature and Alexa wouldn't understand because of the name of the device. Wouldn't it make more sense to say \"Alexa, set the temperature to 72\" instead of \"Alexa, tell ecobee to set the hallway temperature to 72\"... when you're talking to the thermostat directly? That was frustrating.\n\nThird- It didn't feel particularly well made. It was poor quality, but certainly not the $250 I paid for it.\n\nOne major GOOD thing is the fact that it works well with HomeKit. The nest (which I replaced the ecobee with) does not, and it just makes no sense. The ecobee integration with HomeKit was seamless and straightforward. I have to give this a big thumbs up on that front.\n\nThe features on this are nice, and the external sensor is a great touch, but it just really failed to wow me. I know a lot of people love theirs and I can see why they would. It's not at all a bad product. But it just doesn't feel like it's as refined as it should be, the quality doesn't feel like it's all there yet, and the lack of a simple clock makes me feel like there is more of a \"this will do\" attitude than a \"let's make this as amazing as it can be\""}

This makes it much more pleasant to deal with in a house with a variety of Alexa devices. It still responds significantly slower than my other Alexa devices, but hey, it's primarily a thermostat, that's a trade off I can accept.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nAs a thermostat, it's great, but let's face it. The main reason you are going to buy a ecobee4 instead of the ecobee3 is the Alexa integration. There are a few slight improvements from the ecobee3 overall, a slightly better power extender kit, and slightly better mounting option, but nothing worth the cost difference. It's the built in Alexa that is the attractive feature. Sadly, this is where the ecobee4 is lacking. I have a bunch of Alexa devices in my home already. If I talk , even if I'm about equidistant between two, only one responds. At least, that's how it used to be. Introducing the ecobee4... the dimwitted Alexa cousin. When I ask one of my Alexa's something within earshot of the ecobee4 the appropriate Alexa will start responding, and then about 3-4 seconds later the ecobee4 will say something like \"I'm sorry I don't know what the heck you want me to do.\" It got to the point where I just said to heck with it, and decided I would turn off the Alexa feature on the thermostat, as it was so annoying. Unfortunately this is equally annoying, because then the thermostat has an obnoxious red light on at all times. Hopefully some of these issues will be resolved in a firmware update in the near future, but until then, while it's a great thermostat, it is a lousy Alexa."}

Every positive ever stated regarding the Ecobee3 is just as true with the Ecobee4, plus reasonably good on-board Amazon Alexa integration (more on this below), and for THE SAME ENTRY PRICE as the previous Ecobee3. Since the many pros of the ecobee system are well established and reviewed, I will focus on the on-board Alexa capabilities.\n\nThose disappointed with the on-board Alexa performance seem to have expectations not grounded in reality. It is unrealistic to expect that a device which is first and foremost a thermostat, with a thermostat form factor, would somehow have the same microphone array and dynamic signal distance processing as a full fledged, stand alone Echo. There is a reason this is not the same size or cost (entry price, not now that it's reduced due to the emergence of the 4) as an Ecobee3+Echo would have been, or even an Ecobee3+Dot.\n\nThat said, I find the Alexa voice recognition to work well. In practice, it is very similar to the performance of my 2 Echo Dots, which is to say it is generally capable but far less spectacular than that of my full size Echo.\n\nFor those whose chief complaint is that the Thermostat responds even when it is not the closest Alexa device, the simple solution is to change the wake word for all other Echo devices in the Alexa App (\"Echo\" is a better wake word anyway- it is less syllables, and it lends itself to clearer enunciation and a distinct cadence better than \"Alexa\"). In fact, my biggest gripe with the Ecobee4 is that you cannot (yet) change its wake word from \"Alexa\".\n\nIn summary, Ecobee4 is everything Ecobee3 is/was, plus a reasonable stand-alone Alexa device, which means it is still by far the best smart thermostat system for those whose home floor plan is more complex than a studio appartment. Just like a typical annual smartphone model refresh, I wouldn't bother pulling an Ecobee3 off the wall and parting with it to get an Ecobee4, but for anyone else, I'd strongly recommend the Ecobee4."}

The game changer that Ecobee is famous for is the remote sensors that help monitor the temperature in other rooms of your home and help you feel comfortable. Our old thermostat is downstairs in a relatively cool room, while the rest of the house tends to get hot/cold depending on the season.\n\nHowever, despite the features and useful sensors I felt that the Ecobee4 felt and looked very cheap on the wall for the price. Compared to the Nest, which has a nice LCD screen and heavy metal casing, the Ecobee4 is basically the same plastic as my old trusty Honeywell programmable thermostat. The actual LCD display looked cheap as it wasn't smooth font. It was very pixel/digital looking.\n\nWhile this might not bother some, I felt that compared to the competition, The 4th gen of the Ecobee could have put more effort into the overall look/feel of the product.\n\nMy other big issue with the Ecobee was the iOS app. It was very slow to navigate between the menus and was generally not user friendly. I felt that the overall feel of the product was confusing and off putting to the average user. Being familiar with other Smart thermostats, my general test of user friendly is getting my wife to use it without and prior knowledge. She was able to navigate and use the Nest and Honeywell smart thermostats, but the ecobee she was lost completely. Which again, I feel like goes against the entire purpose of why people buy these expensive devices - being able to install and go without too much interacting.\n\nOverall, the Ecobee4 is still a great device with lots of very handy features, but I would recommend buyers purchase the Ecobee3 over the 4. They are essentially the same without the native Alexa support. My hopes are the 5th gen Ecobee will make a better screen/resolution/font and make an overall more premium looking product at the high price point."}

Two things Ecobee4 are better: price and the separate sensor. You can put the sensor in a room to get the real temperature and accurate control. Big plus! HOWEVER, in terms of the overall design, usability and quality, NEST is much better. It has better scheduling function, faster (when making changes and reopening the app, ecobee needs to wait for loading for one or two seconds ). A serious defect of ecobee is that the temp control broke down sometimes. I run the A/C according to the preset schedule and the temperature of my baby's room. However, the control or the scheduling function didn't work properly. It kept cooling but the temperature remained the same. And the temperature from the sensor suddenly dropped down and was already 4 degrees below the temperature I set. Then I tried a couple of times to turn it down through my phone but it was loading and loading and loading... I have to get up and shut down the AC in the old way... This happened twice after I bought it the day before yesterday... None of them is perfect. Overall, ecobee's separate sensor is a great feature, but Nest has better overall design and more reliable performance."}

We love it. We put 1 sensor in the bedroom, 1 in the TV area and 1 in the office while the thermostat is in the dining area. It took a while before we understood how to get all the \"comfort settings\" setup, but now I love how it \"knows\" where we are and handles the temperature accordingly. A couple of months ago we installed air conditioning. All of a sudden we didn't have enough wires running to the thermostat to control everything. That's when I learned about the PEK included (and that I threw away 2 years ago!). We needed it to function \"now\", so rather than wait for Ecobee to send me a new one as they graciously offered I ordered a Venstar Add-A-Wire from Amazon and had it here and connected the next day. Then they announced the Ecobee4! I also have an Echo and 2 Dots. I was considering getting another Dot for the Dining area, but didn't really have a good spot for one. Long story short: I ordered the Ecobee4 from Amazon as soon as it was discounted a bit, donated the Ecobee3 to my sister (happy birthday!) and installed the Ecobee4 using the included PEK. I love how the included PEK is magnetic, it made installation a whole lot easier. It was confusing getting the old sensors to move from the Ecobee3 to the Ecobee4 (hint - while the Ecobee3 is still connected tell it to forget about the sensors so then they will know that they are \"unattached\" and will sync up easily with then new Ecobee). Apple HomeKit sees all the sensors and both Siri and Alexa let me control the thermostat. As an added bonus the sensors all are seen by Perceptive Automation's Indigo home automation software and it makes it very easy to do things like only turn off lights at night if no one is in the room. Couldn't be happier with it."}

My installer got the thing running without much hassle - not sure whether this is a DIY unless you are handy with wiring. Setting up the Alexa service took some time - just understanding the linkage between alexa.amazon.com and what needs to be specified at that level in order for the voice service to work in a meaningful way. Devices have to registered, skills denoted. Finding the right app to get the service to do simple things like estimate commute time was a trial and error process.

I first was looking at a Nest, but after some conversation about the remote sensors and seeing that Ecobee 4 was just released, I decided to take a chance and i'm really glad I did. Now...I can't tell you why to buy this over a Nest because I don't have an in depth knowledge of what a Nest does vs the Ecobee, but I can tell you this is one snazzy gadget that does what it said it would do. We have a two story home with the extra sensor placed in the bedroom upstairs with the main system downstairs. When we first moved in a month or so ago and even after installing a ceiling fan, I was very warm at nights and I wasn't sure what else to do until I learned of the whole sensor system. After we got the system up and running and calibrated to our tastes, the warm nights are a thing of the past and I couldn't be happier.\n\nInstallation was a breeze to, but that doesn't mean I didn't have to call to verify some wiring. Last time I installed a thermostat I was in a much newer home, so the installation was a bit easier with more modern wiring. This time around my home was a bit older, and even though they warn you to check your wires beforehand, I rolled the dice. Lucky for when I opened the box everything looked alright, but I called anyway and got a human after only a couple of button pushes...No waiting. The girl was previously an HVAC Tech and fully trained, so I sent her the pictures of my setup, she made a couple of suggestions, and I was done. I will say I couldn't get the heat to function after going through all the system prompts, so I called back and again got someone super fast and super helpful, they walked me through the options and we found the issue and tested the heat and no issues.\n\nThe interface is cool and fun. I will say I got the issue that everyone has with Alexa as we have a home full of Echo Dots. At first if you talked to Alexa on the Ecobee then all the other Alexas in the house would answer (It was actually pretty funny). I solved this by changing the wake word on all the other Echo to \"Echo\" and everything works fine now. I DO hope they allow us to change the wake word on the Ecobee or at least make the integration better in a future firmware update, but for now it's a small problem and nothing that made me dislike the product. In fact the speaker is pretty good and since the thermostat is near our kitchen, we use it to play music and news while we are cooking and it sounds fine to us. One other tidbit is that you do have to speak a bit louder for her to hear if you have alot of noise, but again...Not a huge deal. Just keep in mind that you are buying a thermostat that has Alexa as a bonus, not a Echo that acts as a thermostat and you will be fine."}

First, I have zero experience with thermostat wiring. Using the guide-in-the-box, I was able to install the Ecobee in about an hour. That included opening up our HVAC system and installing their power-extender. Next, the new Ecobee thermostat now controls the main floor of the house, and the basement. Consistently with the old thermostat, the basement was always freezing during the spring and summer--about 5 to 9 degrees colder than the main floor. By placing the Ecobee sensor there, we are so far seeing about a 1 to 5 degree difference. And the 5 degree difference is when there is no one in the room--as the Ecobee senses that. Realistically, that's what should happen. As an added bonus, we have noticed that the main floor (where the Ecobee is) remains much more comfortable. Again, the old-school thermostats merely turn the AC on and off in bursts. This made the house cold for a bit, then temperate, then cold again. The Ecobee's auto-control of the fan smooths out the temperature, to the point where you don't notice it anymore. This is how smart technology should work."}

The added sensor just gives the system an extra pair of \"eyes\" to ensuring that the temperature is at the most optimal state.\n\nInstallation I thought was going to be hard, but in the end, it was quite easy. It took a non-technical person like myself less than half an hour to install. The Alexa component is an added bonus too... she's responsive and although I'm not a frequent user of an active-voice interface, I do find her useful whenever I just don't feel like moving!\n\nAll in all, this is a great, sleek product that is an all-round great addition to the features of my home.

The issue is that Ecobee decided to only support 2.4GHz frequencies. Meanwhile, most other devices that you purchase with WiFi operate on 5GHz or they offer an option of running on both (selecting the band that offers the best performance on their own, usually). I was excited when I heard Ecobee was coming out with a 4th-generation device and that excitement was depleted like the air out of a kid's balloon that had just been popped with a sharp object, because the ground-breaking feature on the Ecobee4 is not modernized WiFi technologies -- it's instead Amazon Alexa. So at a time when people are running out and purchasing all these high-end routers to go from Wireless 802.11n to Wireless 802.11ac to support the higher and more frequent bandwidth usage of all their connected devices, Ecobee decided to retain wireless technology from 2009. So the issue that this has caused is when I get a new router, the Ecobee will work fine for a few months and then randomly, one day I'll lose the ability to control it from my smartphone. I have a Ring 720p and they also decided to do the same, but at least it connects when the 2.4GHz and 5GHz network names are the same. The Ecobee WILL NOT. What this means is that you have to create a whole separate network JUST FOR the Ecobee or I have to split up all my 2.4GHz and 5GHz devices across two separate networks which means I lose the ability to control everything from the Home kit in iOS because I'd essential have to change networks to control my AC and change networks back for just about everything else (the way my network is configured now). I'm surprised Ecobee has not been sued yet for false advertisement because that's a silly and huge lapse in judgment that they've now done twice. Without cloud connectivity you might as well save the money and just go get a regular thermostat because you can't control the A/C from anywhere and you can't change or access any of the settings or reporting."}

We moved in this February, and we instantly realized that the doors and windows were not suitable for a New England winter. The basement and main floor are incredibly drafty and cold and all the heat gets stuck on the 2nd floor. We got a quote to replace the doors and windows, and after I recovered from sticker shock we decided to hold off on that project and invest in a smart thermostat to at least help us control the temperature in different zones of our house in a smart way without racking up a huge bill. I was initially going to go out and buy a Nest, but my partner is a VERY thorough and researched consumer. He insisted on doing research and watching reviews, and I'm very happy we did. We ended up with an Ecobee4, and we could not be happier.\n\nIn terms of setup and use, the Ecobee is VERY user friendly. I gave my partner the task of installing it, thinking it would take him all day, and I was shocked when I called him on my morning break and he was already done. We did the mobile setup together that night and it literally took only several minutes and we didn't have any moments of confusion... it just worked.\n\nWhat sold us on the Ecobee4 is the fact that it knows how to make our frigid basement (where my partner's home office is) warm while cooling down our 2nd floor bedroom. That feature has made us extremely satisfied with our purchase. It does also have a built in Amazon Alexa, and I don't care so much about that, but my partner is absolutely DELIGHTED by it. At least once a week he shows me some new trick he's learned he can do via that feature.\n\nOverall, Ecobee4 is money well spent and I highly recommend it."}

It's been only a couple of weeks since installing the unit but I've been thoroughly impressed with Ecobee's features and design.\n\nInstallation: It was easy. Honestly. Even though our home is older (100+ years), our furnace is on the newer side (thank you previous owners) and as such, we didn't have any issues re-wiring. As the instructions state, make sure you turn the power off before installing. I also took a quick picture of the old wiring just to make sure I had a record of what was done previously before installing the Ecobee.\n\nUsage: We're both iPhone users and I've found the app to be intuitive and well designed. To be honest, I haven't adopted Siri into how I use my phone or search for information. With that said, I've enjoyed the ease of interaction between myself and Alexa. Call me strange but \"talking to my house\" is somehow more acceptable than talking to my phone. Maybe it's a Star Trek thing, who knows. I have a daily habit of asking Alexa to tell me something funny while I make breakfast. We've always cooked in the kitchen with music and I've appreciated being able to verbally tell Alexa to turn on a playlist rather than using my iPad or iPhone. The room sensor addition is a great add-on and another reason I chose Ecobee over the Nest. Our bedrooms have been typically warmer than our main floor and since installing the Ecobee we've slept more comfortably due to its ability to regulate temperature more effectively.\n\nBonus: As an avid user of IFTTT I've found some great recipes to use and take advantage of the various platforms that integrate with both the Ecobee and Alexa.\n\nI couldn't be more pleased with my selection."}

This coming from someone who has played with home automation for a bit.... (Google home, echo, dot, Nest, Hue)\nI can be 2 feet away and speak out the words loudly and nothing happens!\nI end up yelling at my thermostat from 2 feet away like a crazy person.\nSo obviously this is bad news for changing things from across the room and forget about doing it from the next room. Unless you yell loud enough where the neighbors might know what you are trying to do.\nIts bad, really bad and it is also.... SLOW!\n'I need a minute' or just phasing out is often seen with this.\nI regret paying the extra 50 to get this device with Alexa. I should have gone the ecobee3 route and saved the cash. Sadly its on my wall and return shipping and a lack of a thermostat backup means I have to suffer with this poorly done thermostat.\n\nTLDR: Buy an ecobee3 instead, and get an amazon tap or dot for your Alexa needs.\nAn alexa device it is not...\n\nPost questions if you have any as an early adopter I would be glad to help"}

So I tried replacing it several times with other \"smart\" thermostats. Don't buy the Honeywell Lyric!! Ugh the worst!

Alexa responds maybe 50% of the time. The rest of the time she says \"Sorry I need a minute\" or nothing at all. This is insanely frustrating when all you want to do is something simple like turn on the lights. Not to mention their support page is less than useless. The remote sensors in theory are neat but don't seem to actually do anything noticeable with the comfort level in my house. My electric bill actually went up a few bucks since installing this thing so I can't say that it's a money saver or \"green\" to any appreciable extent. If you want a smart thermostat with voice control, get yourself a Nest and pair it with an Echo Dot. Unless you love being frustrated out of your mind, then buy this garbage.\n\nOriginal review: Wasn't terribly difficult to install, even using the included Power Extender Kit to accommodate the lack of a C wire on the thermostat it replaced. All told took probably 30 minutes to get everything wired up. The included instructions are quite good for this. As to the thermostat's primary function, that is, you know, being a thermostat, it works perfectly. Remote control via smart phone app can be a bit laggy and unresponsive at times, but not terribly so. The ability to use Ecobee's remote sensors to even out the temperature in your home, or dial in the temperature in a specific room, is outstanding and really the star of the show for this line of thermostats. It's a shame the Ecobee4 only comes with 1 remote sensor, you will definitely want more. The big addition to the Ecobee4 is obviously the Alexa integration. It works well enough but lacks some features that I understand are fairly standard on Echo devices, namely voice training to help it understand your voice better, and bluetooth compatibility to hook up a remote speaker, which is a real missed opportunity here. But, being able to talk to my thermostat to turn on my lights, read me the news and weather, start my robot vacuum's cleaning cycle, turn up the heat, or play my favorite podcast is all pretty magical. The odd thing is that for Alexa being the big new feature for the Ecobee4, you can't talk to the thermostat out of the box to adjust the temperature -- instead you need to download the Alexa app on your phone, pair it to your Ecobee4, enable the Ecobee skill in the Alexa app, then run a device discovery in the Alexa app to find your Ecobee4. Even then it's a bit clunky to adjust the temperature, you have to call the thermostat by the name you gave it when you set up the Ecobee4 in the first place. For instance if you chose to name it \"thermostat\" you have to say \"Alexa, turn the thermostat temperature up 2 degrees.\" You can also ask it for the temperature reporting from any of your remote sensors, but you cannot ask it to increase the temperature in the area your sensor is located, which is another missed opportunity. All said, if you are in the market for a smart thermostat and don't already have an Echo device in your house, the Ecobee4 is a no-brainer. However, if you already have an Echo device in your home, you'd be better suited to pick up the cheaper Ecobee3."}

It's my 1st experience using Alexa, and that built-in function is impressive. However,, a caveat (and I hope Eccobee reads this).\n\nMy old thermostat had 5 wires (the required number to connect the Eccobee4 without the power extender), HOWEVER my old thermostat had 1 yellow wire connected to the \"Y2\" contact and no wire connected to the Y1 contact. When I went thru the Eccobee setup, a message appeared saying I needed a \"Y1\". I called Eccobee technical support within their support hours. After a lengthy hold, I requested a call back. I never got a callback.\n\nI continued to research the 1 yellow wire issue and found that Y2 is used if you have a \"2 stage\" HVAC system. If you have an HVAC \"2 stage\" system, there should be wires connected to both Y1 & Y2. I suspected that the original HVAC contractor wired the old thermostat wrong. I connected the yellow to Y1, and I was able to set up Eccobee4. Eccobee should include this possibility in their instructions. They should also improve their technical support.\n\nEDIT May 28, 2017: Alexa would recognize commands but wouldn't play music. I shut off the circuit that powered Ecobee4 for a few moments and turned it back on. That fixed the problem."}

I know nothing about HVAC and was able to get it up and running within an hour. It is a little intimidating playing with your HVAC system. However, it is really just a matter of transferring wires from your old thermostat to the Ecobee. My common wire was not spliced, so I had to grab some pliers and splice the end in order to avoid installing the power extender (also super simple to do on both ends).\n\nOverall, you will not regret purchasing it. The Alexa add on is nice, as it plays well with other applets like Pandora, Google Calendar, etc. I most enjoy the web portal accessible from any browser or mobile device.

I've been waiting for a long time for something truly compelling to hit the market. I like the aesthetic of the Nest, but it lacked features. I especially wanted something that could account for temperatures in the back room upstairs which tends to get hot in the summer and cold in the winter. I have SmartThings, but didn't want to rely on a cloud service for controlling my thermostat, too unreliable. I'm also a regular user of Echo/Alexa, so this seemed like the best option.\n\nAs far as thermostats go, it is outstanding. It has all the capabilities you could possibly want. Like you would expect, you can program modes (home, away, sleep), schedules (what time to trigger modes), and remote access using the app. It also seamlessly integrates with my other automation systems like SmartThings and IFTT. You can also fine tune lots of little aspects, like the ability to run the fan for so many minutes every hour or how long to run the fan after the AC turns off to help circulate air.\n\nThe remote sensor is also very useful. You can set the main temp on the thermostat to be the average of all the sensors combined. This allows the thermostat to base it's heating and cooling cycles on all the rooms. I plan on adding a Keen Smart Vent to one of the rooms that gets too hot, but now the thermostat will never over heat or under cool that room.\n\nIt's not perfect though. These are the reasons I took away 1 star. Hoping they can fix some of these things in the future.\n- Presence sensors aren't very effective. You need to have one in every room to use this feature. It seems to lose track of you when you're sleeping.\n- Far field microphones aren't as good as the Echo's. It hears you no problem if it's quiet, but seems like you need to speak loudly if there is any noise in the room. Echo is much better at hearing you through ambient noise. I am sometimes standing right next to it and it misses the wake word.\n- It seems strange that when I finished the intial setup and tried to adjust the temp via Alexa, she had no idea what I was talking about. Out of the box, Alexa didn't know it was a thermostat. Beyond the initial guided setup process on the thermostat, there was additional setup needed in order for Alexa to be able to find the thermostat on the Alexa app. This setup wasn't referenced anywhere in the manual or the guided setup. Seems silly that a thermostat with voice control doesn't know it's a thermostat from the get go.\n- Alexa isn't fully functional. She is missing certain capabilities. You can't change her name on the thermostat, she must be called Alexa. You can't play some 3rd party music apps like Pandora or Spotify, but most seem to work. You can't receive or send messages. You can do all of these things on the Echo."}

I've used every generation of the Nest Thermostat and was tempted to try this new Ecobee4. I love the Nest, but I want Apple HomeKit compatibility. By that standard, the Ecobee4 hits the mark. HomeKit integration works just as I thought it would and was easy to set up.\nBy every other measure, though, I prefer the Nest in almost every way and if it was HomeKit enabled, I'd still go back to it. Though not the primary reason for my purchase, the Amazon Alexa integration was another tempting reason to buy the Ecobee4. I have several Echo Dots and thought this might be able to let me ditch some of the extra devices. Not even close. The microphone built into this is absolutely horrible. Even wth ZERO background noise, I have to SHOUT to get it to hear me. My Dot can hear me from rooms away. This might be a somewhat valuable bonus feature, but do not buy this thinking that it is a substitute or replacement for a Dot or Echo device. Installation was fairly straitforward, but Nest included a mounting bracket which I needed to install in my single-gang drywall hole. Ecobee did not include this and it made physically mounting the unit on the wall a challenge. Interface-wise, the vertical temperature scroll doesn't seem as intuitive as the rotating ring on the Nest. To be fair, the extra room sensor on the Ecobee is a nice feature, theoretically, but I live in a small space and it is not much use to me. The Nest also beats this in build-quality. The Ecobee seems cheaper and more plasticly. Even the screen quality and fonts seem low-res. I'm keeping this because I like the HomeKit advantages, but I'll be keeping my eyes open for an alternative."}
{"Author": "heisenburg", "Date": "on May 18, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Ecobee4: More than a thermostat", "Text": "Ecobee has built on previous smart thermostat ideas with yet another killer feature: Onboard Alexa. For those that have your thermostat somewhere that is occupied/centralized in your house, this puts answers to questions, automation adjustments (such as temperature changes), and other Alexa functionality centrally in your house. Add this to the other awesome Ecobee4 features that carry over from the Ecobee3 such as room sensors, and you have a very solid product that really does a great job becoming a vital part of your daily routine.\n\nMy previous top consideration, the Nest, was cool but had one major downside: If you spent too much time away from the thermostat, it would switch to \"Away\" and stop conditioning your house. Nest realized this shortcoming and released $100 combo smoke detectors and presence sensors. While I appreciate their thought, $100 per additional sensor is just not realistic for your typical consumer. Along came Ecobee. In the package you get the Thermostat and a second motion+temperature sensor, and can add more sensors than you'd ever need by buying additional packs. They are tiny (less than 2\" x 2\") and can be put just about anywhere. I have mine on the wall with regular push pins. Ecobee says you should get years of life out of each battery (worlds better than the 4 or 5 months I get from some of my other smart home accessories), and the range is acceptable but not fantastic. Installation was easy. I have an older house (late 70s construction) so I only had 4 wires. The Ecobee requires 5 wires, but comes with an adapter for houses with only 4. Side comparison: the Nest does not require 5 wires, but does recommend it. It can theoretically run off of 4 wires, but simply charges an onboard battery any time the air handler is running. If the battery starts getting low, it will actually run your air handler more than needed to recharge itself! I much prefer Ecobees honest approach to an adapter than Nest\u2019s unnecessary additional runtime. Air handlers use about 500w of electricity simply running the fan! Not very green, Nest! The primary thermostat is easy to use, though to be honest I almost never touch it. The interface is mostly intuitive and easy to navigate. I wish there was a little more customization available for what information shows in idle mode (it changes modes when you approach the thermostat), but right now it displays the current calculated temperature (based on remote sensors that detect motion and the thermostat) as well as the outside weather conditions.\n\nAnother enjoyable feature: Home IQ. Having an older home, I\u2019m always curious to know how my home\u2019s efficiency compares to that of houses around me. Ecobee\u2019s Home IQ feature provides you insight into how your house compares to similar houses in your area. In addition, it tallies total daily runtime, presence sensor activity and temperature history, and a few other things. If their built-in analytics aren\u2019t enough, you can download the raw data via .csv. The App works well, and mirrors the interface you are provided on the front of the thermostat. I do not have any Apple products, but the HomeKit/Siri integration is convenient for those in the Apple ecosystem. With how rarely I touch my thermostat, I don\u2019t mind breaking my phone out or walking to the unit. Overall, I think I made the right choice.\n\nHere\u2019s a TL:DR \u2013\nPros:\n-Integrated Alexa means convenience for your household\n-Saves money quickly over a non-scheduled thermostat\n-Keeps your house comfortable even if you don\u2019t frequent the room containing the thermostat\n-Provides easy access via an app, web portal, or Siri\n-Gives you insight into your energy use and system cycle times via their Home IQ portal\n-Warns you of dangerous or unexpected temperatures inside your house\n-Active development by Ecobee means constant new features added to the software of the device.\nCons:\n-Sensors are still a little expensive (I\u2019d love to see a $20 price point) and can have a limited range\n-You may need to do a little additional install work if your home has less than 5 wires running to the thermostat"}

I called their customer support and the gentleman I talked to was able to guide me through the installation with ease.\n\nThe good:\n1. Remote sensors - I one of the remote sensors set up in my bedroom. At night, the thermostat only uses the sensor in my bedroom to control the HVAC system. Since that is the only room on my first floor being used at night, this could potentially save me money.\n2. Alexa speaker built in - Even though it doesn't have ESP (Echo Spatial Perception) and a few other key alexa capabilities, it's nice to have another alexa\n3. Responsive display\n\nThe bad:\n1. Does not support ESP (Echo Spatial Perception) This is the technology that will keep multiple alexa enabled devices from responding to the alexa wake word.\n2. \"Alexa\" is the only wake word available on the Ecobee4.\n3. Does not support Spotify.\n4. Does not support the new Echo to Echo Alexa voice calling.\n\nIf you'll notice, the only complaints I have is that the Alexa Speaker functionality is a little limited though I still find it very handy. I do like it well enough that I plan on purchasing another one in a few days.\n\nIn closing, I will quote the CNET article which I highly suggest reading.\n\n\"The Bottom Line; There's no comparison -- the Ecobee4 is the best smart thermostat available today.\""}

My thermostat is located in a less-traveled area of my home so the Nest thermostat would constantly turn my system to 'away' status as it thought my home was unoccupied. I first chose the ecobee3 with 1 smart sensor. This worked extremely well at recognizing when I was home/away as I placed the sensor in my open living room/kitchen. Then, I became a beta tester for the ecobee4 with Alexa built-in. I was extremely excited to use it as I did not already have Alexa in the home. In the middle of my testing, I also obtained 2 more sensors for the bedrooms in my home. With those new sensors, my home is now more comfortable at night; meaning that the bedrooms no longer become hotspots while we sleep. Back to Alexa, this was a welcome addition to my thermostat. We frequently use the timer function, play music function, and my kids get a kick out of \"Alexa, tell me a joke\".\n\nThough Alexa has been a welcome addition to my home, I do not use it frequently enough to justify having it. I wish I knew of an in-depth Alexa guide that would allow me to become more of a 'power-user'. That would be very helpful to include in the boxed materials with ecobee4.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with the device just as I was with the ecobee3.\n\nHere are some pros:\n- very accurate temperature settings with my 3 sensors\n- the app is excellent. I can change temps anywhere with a data connection.\n- this device has helped me save energy/money month over month while not compromising the comfort of my home.\n- Alexa is a welcome addition but I only wish I knew how to use it to its potential.\n\nA few cons:\n- the ecobee4 is thicker than the ecobee3. It is a minor adjustment but the 3 looked better on my wall.\n- Alexa will sometimes wake on her own to say something like \"i cannot help you right now, please try again later\". Luckily, this has not been an issue too much. I presume that it hears dialogue from the TV or from occupants in the home as a potential Alexa command.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate in buying either the ecobee3 or ecobee4. Both are excellent. For me, I look forward to learning more about the benefits of having Alexa. I think there will be many improvements down the line for AI use in the home and I am happy to have it built in to my ecobee4."}

Low res so you can see pixels unlike a modern cell phone. Due to ADA, and maybe building trends, our builder installed the thermostats at 48 inches. This means that it is well below eye level for most people, and the LCD screen does not have a very good range of viewing angles. This makes it difficult to look downwards upon and easily read and navigate.\n\nThe light for Alexa is bright, and I could not find an option to lower it so it's less obtrusive in a dark room.\n\nAlexa didn't seem great or that useful to me, and had trouble recognizing requests from two different people. This isn't really Ecobee's fault I guess, but it was one of the selling features to me that disappointed.\n\nPersonally, I was switching to Ecobee from Nest for Homekit integration but I found I never used it so without that one benefit (the sensors don't do much for me) I prefer the Nest."}

If you use a phrase like \"Hey Alexa\" the Echo Dot will recognize you are talking to it, but the Ecobee will not. While this may seem obvious, it did not to me and that was my fault. Nevertheless, I believe Ecobee is looking to make this easier to use with phrases like this to make the Ecobee more like other Echo devices. The microphone is still not as sensitive as the Echo Dots I have, but that may also be an update fix. Other issues I am having are device discovery only finding some of my devices (Echo finds) and it does not pair to bluetooth speaker like the Echo Dot does. I believe the speaker quality could be improved with an omnidirectional speaker so it's speaker clarity is better from further away. While the kinks are worked out I am updating the review to four stars."}

The ecobee4 works well as a simple thermostat but has a few flaws. It does not handle multiple user households well. Only one user can manage it. Also, it doesn't learn the HVAC system. It will wait until the temp is exceeded and then attempt to cool so it always stays a degree or two above the set limit. My nest gets ahead of it to keep it at the desired temp"}

UPDATE June 1,2017", "Text": "********* UPDATE and bump up to 5 Stars *******\n\nI'm updating this review - the original review is below this new information. Once we moved into our new house, I was unable to connect this thermostat via the included power adapter hard wired to the air handler. I finally had the professional air conditioning guy out last week and it took him 35 minutes to get it connected and working properly, but it's installed. Turns out that the 10 year old HVAC system here has the wires color coded differently than usual and it was a bit of a jigsaw puzzle for the AC guy to sort out and correct. It was totally worth the fifty dollar service call fee.\n\nThe Ecobee is programmed for Home, Away, and Sleep with different settings for each and it's set to automatic control. This means that I never have to touch it now. It just works and our entire house is comfortable at the right times.\n\nThe thermostat saw our Wi-Fi network immediately and had no trouble connecting and its connection to Alexa was smooth. The touchscreen display shows our local weather correctly which is a neat trick. I love that the speaker is Alexa's voice so there's no disconnection from the Echo to the Ecobee and the Ecobee even employs the familiar blue light when speaking for Alexa.\n\n********* Original Review ********\nSince we're in the midst of a whole house renovation, I absolutely want a smart thermostat and the fact that this one speaks to Alexa is just extra icing on the cake. The customization options were a pleasant surprise - especially since our old thermostat could barely tell me what temperature it was set to. Plus the Ecobee is sleek and sophisticated looking while doing lots of cool things - acting as a speaker via Alexa is a very neat feature.\n\nI installed this first in our old house using the existing C wire to power it. Total install time was about 30 minutes. The sensor was placed two rooms away and seemed to operate correctly for the three days we were still living there. The entire system tied in to our Wi-Fi with no drama.\n\nHowever, once we made the move to our new house last weekend, everything sort of fell apart. Turns out the system in this house does not have a C wire set-up. The Ecobee website, YouTube videos and instruction booklet give the instructions on using the included power adapter and hard wiring it inside the air handler. I have tried four times over two days to wire this thing up with zero success. There's something weird going on that is beyond my comprehension and requires an actual A/C guy or electrician to deal with. Until I can get a professional out, this will go back in the box and the Paleolithic era thermostat with its very simple two AA batteries, will stay in control."}
{"Author": "sw", "Date": "on May 8, 2017", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Not very good", "Text": "***Update, 9/13/17: The Ecobee was working perfectly, for about a month, and then it suddenly refused to make an Internet connection. After a lot of back & forth with Ecobee, testing everything they suggested, and them telling me my Internet provider (Spectrum) must be blocking the necessary ports, and Spectrum telling me they definitely are not, and me forwarding those specific ports (8089, 8189, and 8190), and the Ecobee STILL not working, I have to drop a star. I may just have gotten a bad one, but Ecobee refuses to replace it; they still claim it's anyone/everyone else's fault. So I bought a Nest E, and it's been working flawlessly; no connection problems at all.***\n\nThis is my first smart thermostat, and the first thermostat I installed myself. I was nervous about installing it, especially when I found out I didn't have a C wire, meaning I'd have to install the PEK, but it went surprisingly well. I took my time, took photos, labeled the wires (labels included in the package), and followed the simple instructions. It worked as soon as I turned the power back on, and the set-up was simple, too.\n\nThe most confusing thing I came across was that when I spoke to Alexa in the Ecobee, I'd hear a reply from both Ecobee & my Echo (and sometimes, they were different replies - more about that in the next paragraph). The solution was simple: rename the wake word for the Echo (it was also \"Alexa\"). Now, when I talk to Alexa in the Ecobee, only that one replies. When I say \"computer\" to the Echo, only the Echo replies.\n\nWhen I was hearing replies from both devices, I'd sometimes hear different replies from each. I realized it was when I asked for something \"local\" like the weather, or traffic. The problem was that the Ecobee put me in a slightly different location (an adjacent city), even though I set it up with my specific zip code. That was a quick fix, too: I just logged into the Ecobee website & updated the location.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with it. I don't use Ecobee's Alexa as much as others may, primarily because I keep my Echo in a nearby room, so I'm more likely to use that, but when I do use it, it's as responsive & useful as my Echo."}
{"Author": "JLES", "Date": "on May 1, 2017", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Easy to install, almost limitless settings configurations and Alexa integration. What's not to love!", "Text": "Installation would have been a breeze even without the step by step instructions. It only took me about 15 minutes to install it. Normally the hardest thing is to make sure it is completely level but Ecobee thought of that and it has a built in leveler for you to go by. After the thermostat is installed it goes through a self check to make sure all the wiring is correct before it will turn itself on. This is a great feature to make sure that you don't damage your HVAC unit. I have to say this is the first smart thermostat that I have ever owned and I was very impressed. After the quick installation I probably spent another hour going through all the settings and fine tuning everything. It probably would have been fine to keep it all at the default settings but I am someone that likes to play with my new toys.\n\nAfter I had it set up to my liking I installed the Sensor in my daughter's room. It always runs about 6 degrees colder or warmer in there depending on if the heat or ac is running. The directions say the main unit will take an average of the two readings and use that to control the HVAC unit. I was a little worried this would make the rest of the house to warm but it works great! I keep the thermostat set on 71 degrees during the day and drop it to 68 degrees at night and now with the sensor installed my daughter's room is always within 1 to 2 degrees of the rest of the house. The rest of the house might get to be 1 degree warmer than the actual setting but I can live with that.\n\nOne of the other reviews said that the thermostat would not connect to other Alexa devices. I had this issue at first also but after a little research I found that all you have to do is install the Ecobee skill on the Alexa app. After that is installed you can control the thermostat from all your Alexa enabled devices as well as ask them what the temp is in each room with a sensor. The Ecobee 4 integrates with Alexa itself also without having to do anything extra. The speaker on it is fairly loud and the microphone picks up your commands from across the room without having to yell at it. My only issue is that my Ecobee is installed next to my T.V and if it's playing loud then issuing commands can be a problem. The only downside that I can find is that the Ecobee 4 doesn't have bluetooth functionality so you can't connect it to an external speaker to play music like you can with the echo dot. I had an echo dot in my living room connected to a bluetooth speaker that was set up away from the T.V. I didn't really need another Alexa enable device so I thought I would just disable the microphone on the Ecobee to keep them from both answering. When I did this the top light glows red and there isn't a way to turn that off. I found that annoying so I just ended up moving the echo dot to my bedroom which I actually found to be convenient.\n\nOverall this thermostat will do anything that you can think of. If you want to just set it and forget it you can put it in auto mode and it will switch back and forth from heat and cool as needed based on your settings and the outdoor temp. You can control how long the fan stays running after the HVAC unit shuts off all the way to how and when your heat strips come on. The possibilities are limitless. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the lack of bluetooth and the red light that comes on if you disable the microphone. I look forward to getting a few more sensors to really fine tune the rest of my house."}

I have really liked owning it. Having a temperature monitor in two separate places is great for dialing in my AC system and managing energy consumption.\nI have also owned Amazon Alexa since She first came out. My family really enjoys her, and we have often considered getting a second Alexa for our upstairs. We keep Alexa in the kitchen. She is so helpful with conversions of measurements, news, timers, jamming out to music as we cook as a family, and so many other things.\nWhen I was offered the opportunity to try out Ecobee IV with built in Amazon Alexa, I thought this is amazing. Two devices I love merged in to one. Now I have Alexa upstairs and down. I also got an extra remote sensor with Ecobee IV, so now I have two remote sensors in addition to the Ecobee. I monitor our two hottest rooms, the downstairs southeast bedroom, and the upstairs south west bedroom. I am using the extra data to begin to dampen the registers in the cooler rooms, and make adjustments to keep all of our rooms more comfortable.\nWe are also enjoying using Alexa upstairs. Some times when we are upstairs during family time, we can play games with Alexa. Jeopardy is a family favorite. Also \"Alexa tell me a joke\" is a loved feature.\nNow I have only had Ecobee IV installed for a few days, so we have not used it a whole lot, but I will update my review as pertinent info becomes available.\n\n*****Install note, Ecobee IV is much more intuitive than Ecobee III was. I had install issues with III because of the way my heat pump works. Ecobee IV has a set up wizard that asks questions about the heat pump in order to have the correct settings (this feature may have been added to III in firmware updates, I did my install of Ecobee III last spring). This way you are not blowing hot air when calling for AC. The set up is pretty straightforward, and the hardware is easy to install. If you have Ecobee III, you can not just snap III off, and snap IV on. They are a little different, and require different backing plates (which are included). The backing plates are about the same size, and I believe they attach to the wall in the same way. But the wiring set up is different, and there is a speaker channel for the Alexa feature in the IV base. Ecobee IV does come with wire labels. So I just used the labels and matched the wire with the code from my Ecobee III base, so I knew right where to plug everything in to Ecobee IV. If you are using the blue wire in Ecobee III, you will not need the power extender in the package of Ecobee IV. I saw that thing when I opened the box, and got a little worried I was going to be doing some wiring. Luckily, I did not need it in my setup.\nMy install of Ecobee IV went perfectly and I had it all done in 15 minutes or so, and everything worked perfectly the first time.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI hope to get 4 more remote sensors for various room monitoring in our home (currently there is a plus or minus 5 degree temp swing from the base unit room to the remote rooms). These additional remote sensors will allow Ecobee to better manage our energy usage, and create more home comfort. It works fine with the base unit and one remote (included), but obviously each room has different environmental factors, so more information can help this little super computer really shine.\nI can not wait to unlock all the features that Amazon and Ecobee are likely to implement into this fantastic device. I owned 2 Nest units in a previous home. Between the two, I like Ecobee much better. I like having a touch screen rather than turning a dial. I like the aesthetics, and I like the additional information Ecobee is able to provide through remote room monitoring.\nMy only knock on Ecobee IV is the Alexa speaker is a bit weak. Now this is being pretty critical. When you look at the low profile Ecobee IV platform, you can not expect Alexa to sound like she does, when she is in a crafted aluminum tube, with a much larger speaker and amplifier. Alexa sounds just fine from Ecobee IV, just don't expect her to sound the same as she does from her original home in the bottle."}

{"Author": "PhotoGraphics", "Date": "on April 24, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "The new ecobee 4 has some nice changes", "Text": "After trying and using the other popular smart thermostat in my home I learned many things. The most important was that no matter how basic the thermostat that came with my home HVAC was, it worked for the simple functions it was intended to do. When I installed my first smart device I got a lot of all new features and functionality but the reality of running a day-to-day schedule of heating and cooling my home actually got more complicated and in some ways not any more improved.\n\nWhen ecobee came along I was an early user of their solution including zone sensors, which seemed to be a good idea for my multi-level open-architecture home. But again, in real life there were instances of the more sophisticated system introducing new problems that never existed before. It took me weeks to get things to settle down and even to this day the simple act of operating my HVAC system is less automated than it was with a simple programmable thermostat\n\nBut with the smart features there were things I learned to like, and high on that list was the ability to control my HVAC system from my phone, whether at home or not. In some ways that capability started becoming the number one reason for owning an smart thermostat. But there was definite room for improvement and among them was a tighter integration with Alexa/Echo to allow for more automation and easier control, especially by voice.\n\nI have had Echo sensors at the two places at home (now 3) where I spend the most time and they are \u201cconnected\u201d to my ecobee but this newest , latest version takes that another big step forward and actually builds an Echo right in the thermostat hardware. One advantage is obvious; generally our thermostats are not located anywhere near where it would be logical to have an Echo plugged in. In my case the thermostat is on a wall between the bedrooms on a staircase landing \u2026 the last place I would ever have an Echo. By having the voice control of Alexa in that location I can simple speak to my thermostat as I walk by. The included remote sensor of my thermostat is located in an open section between my kitchen, dining area and living area, also a location I am very unlikely to plug in an Echo, so it would have been nice if the remote sensors acted as mini-Echo\u2019s with microphones in each. They don\u2019t, so let\u2019s list that as suggested improvement #1.\n\nIf nothing else, getting this unit gave me most of the functions of having another Echo, which can be a big cost savings over buying more Echo units (I already had two Dots).\n\nKEY FEATURES OF ECOBEE\n\nBefore going into features (and differences), if you are new to the whole concept of smart thermostats, here is a run-down of what this is all about:\n\n- The ecobee not only turns your A/C on when it\u2019s hot and your heat on when it\u2019s cold but it actually works (via internet) with your local weather service in real-time so it knows what\u2019s going on outside your home as well as inside\n\n- Its key difference is that you can place sensor is different zones of your house which not only helps balance out the efficient use of heating and cooling but can sense which room you are in and control your preferences for that room, not the entire house. It even knows when you go to work, or to bed or on vacation\n\n- The newest feature, Alexa control, let\u2019s you use the thermostat as a timer, to check the news, turn lights on and off, play music and something like 10,000 other \u201cskills\u201d. Of course you will need various other accessories to make some of that happen.\n\n- You can check and change the temperature of your HVAC using a smartphone from anywhere in the world. To me this is the number one reason I like this system\n\n- The software builds usage reports over time which can be helpful in managing your energy usage for maximum economy\n\nTHE GOOD AND THE BAD\n\nLet\u2019s start off with what was probably the biggest complaint about earlier versions \u2026 they didn\u2019t work well with heat pumps. That\u2019s probably because heat pumps aren\u2019t very common where the company is based. When I first got mine I was on the phone for hours with the tech people (I have to give them credit, their tech support was great). They really couldn\u2019t solve it over the phone so they send a professional tech out to complete the installation for me. Compared to installing an old style mechanical thermostat by connecting two wires and turning it on that would have been a major strike against smart thermostats but I was forgiving because we were dealing with some very cutting-edge technology. The good news is that my installation of the new model was butter-smooth, it seemed to know exactly what HVAC gear I have and fine-tune itself accordingly.\n\nWHAT IS CHANGED FROM THE ECOBEE 3 TO THE ECOBEE 4?\n\n- The new model much larger in every dimension\n\n- The new model is \u201crounder\u201d \u2013 the old design was essentially square with rounded corners, the new model is somewhere in-between a square and a circle\n\n- The new model is substantially thicker, it sticks out from the wall almost twice as far\n\n- The new model has a completely flat face, whereas the older design\u2019s face was slightly convex like the face of a clock. The advantages of a flat face are less glare on the screen and it is easier to touch-activate the icons without accidentally brushing against the wrong one\n\n- The pseudo button has been redesigned. The so-called button is actually a sensor but on the older design it looks like a push button. The manufacturer doesn\u2019t mention it anywhere in their documentation and I understand it was a common complaint from users who tried poking it and nothing happened.\n\n- One additional faceplate icon added (for the Alexa/Echo controls)\n\n- Different mounting plate \u2013 the mounting plate is what screws to the wall and the wires from you HVAC attach to it, then the thermostat faceplate simply snaps on to it. The older design had a two-piece mounting plate that was a bit cumbersome. The newly designed plate is much smaller and one piece instead of two. IMPORTANT: the location of the wiring terminals has been switched up for no apparent reason. If you are replacing a previous model with the new design read each terminal label carefully, they are not where they used to be. The mounting plate still has a tiny built-in bubble level which is incredibly useful in mounting the thermostat so it doesn\u2019t lean to one side or the other on your wall.\n\n- Different remote room sensor is pictured on the retail box than what's inside \u2013 this one is something I\u2019m working on getting an answer for, the packaging shows a newly redesigned room sensor that looks more attractive and eliminates the pseudo button mentioned above, but what is actually in the box is the old sensor. This could just be because I was testing an early unit. By the way, the remote sensor can either be mounted to your wall or placed on a desk/tabletop using a little acrylic stand.\n\n- There is now a blue LED light bar on top of the thermostat but when the unit is mounted at the usual height most people won\u2019t be able to see the light itself, only the glow from it on their wall. So my second suggestion is maybe that light should have been on the bottom of the thermostat and serve double-duty as a path light when the motion sensor senses someone walking by (this is a feature I love on my nest smoke detector \u2026 I have it mounted at the top of my stairway and whenever someone walks under it at night a soft nightlight comes on to illuminate the first couple of stairs).\n\n- Staying on the topic of that blue light, one thing I find very distracting is if you prefer to turn the auto-voice-recognition microphone off on the thermostat\u2019s main unit for any reason, that light turns bright red whenever the microphone is turned off. That looks like it is warning me of a danger situation (turning the microphone off is not a danger situation to me). Suggestion three, please change that setting to be able to turn the LED light off!\n\n- And, Amazon Alexa built in, of course (a few words on that later in this review)\n\n- The Power Extender Kit (PEK) has been completely restyled with bigger terminals, larger buttons to clamp the wires and a handy magnet on back so it can stick to the inside of your HVAC main unit. Thoughtful.\n\n- Back trim panel has been redesigned \u2013 the use of this trim plate is optional to cover screw holes or unpainted walls behind your old thermostat. The new design is rounder which some people may prefer but the larger advantage is that the hole in the back for the wires to pass through is much smaller, which means less air from inside your wall can rush through and affect the accuracy of the thermostat\n\n- There is no way to save your settings when you upgrade from a previous model \u2013 this of course only affect users who are upgrading from the previous model but is a missed opportunity for the manufacturer. You should be able to save all of your settings to your online account so when you install the newer model it automatically recalls them. Instead, they do something unexpected \u2026 when you uninstall the old thermostat your account is automatically deleted and you no longer exist to them. You have to start from scratch to set up a whole new account. By the way I\u2019m not talking about 2-3 personal preference settings, there must be at least 50 settings buried deep in the setup menus!\n\n- New model is not listed yet at registration page \u2013 this is not an issue or a problem, remember I looked at an advance unit several weeks before it was announced to the public. So when I had to set up a new account the latest model was not listed as one of my options. Hint: I said that I have an ecobee 3 and it accepted that.\n\nALEXA/ECHO FEATURES\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about the most exciting new feature \u2026 it has a built-in Amazon Alexa Voice Service. In theory that means if you don\u2019t own an Echo, you do now, and if you already own one or more Echo\u2019s it adds another one (which is essentially similar to the Echo Dot). It has built in far-field voice recognition microphones and (like other Echo devices) theoretically only the closest Echo will respond to your voice. I say in theory because the Alexa portion of the thermostat is very slow to wake up. It turns out my thermostat is located almost exactly midway between my upstairs Dot and my downstairs Dot and even if I am standing with my face a foot away from the thermostat it takes so long to realize I\u2019m talking to it that either the upstairs Dot or the downstairs Dot respond first. Sometimes BOTH respond so I have Alexa jabbering at me from all over the house. Then when it finally wakes up and goes \u201chuh?\u201d (it doesn\u2019t really do that) now I have THREE Alexa voices talking to me. What's really weird is that while my two Alexas are saying one thing, the one inside my thermostat is saying something totally different. Obviously this isn\u2019t ideal and I\u2019ll report back once the manufacturer gets a chance to work on this for their final version.\n\nOne more thing about Alexa/Echo integration \u2026 so far it hasn\u2019t been working out so well and apparently that\u2019s not new (there are way too many unhappy users commenting about controlling the previous models with Alexa). Not to be one-sided but it works 100% of the time for me with Siri, but most of the time Alexa won\u2019t/can\u2019t acknowledge that I even have an ecobee device connected let alone control it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nIf you don\u2019t yet have a smart thermostat this new model is the one to get for dozens of good reasons (besides being Alexa/Echo enabled). It smarter and does almost everything I could ever want a thermostat to do. My only downside with smart thermostats is related to my particular climate which is not like most places that have winter settings and summer setting where you can let the thermostat run on a schedule most of the time. Where I live there are two transitional seasons in which we open the windows and doors part of the day and then turn on the heat or A/C the rest of the day. I would love a simple system on/off button on the main unit and on the app that lets me do that and I would really like a system that has window/door sensors that automatically turn the HVAC off whenever a window or door is opened for ventilation.\n\nIf you do already have a previous model should you replace it with the newest model? Well, personally I think the improvements are all positive and if I didn\u2019t already own an Alexa Echo Dot I would definitely do it. Otherwise, the improvements aren\u2019t a quantum leap in features or technology so I would say it is a personal decision if you want to be at the cutting edge with your home gadgets.\n\nOverall I have a high opinion of the newly improved model and none of the quibbles I mentioned should count against that until the final production models hit the mainstream and any bugs are worked out. So for now my score is high based on my own personal user satisfaction."}
{"Author": "S Young", "Date": "on April 21, 2017", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Pleasant surprise", "Text": "Be aware - you're going to have to take things apart to install this. the instructions are very good, and it even comes with tags for the wires so that you don't get things screwed up. In all, it took us about two hours to work through it and get it all connected up, so not terrible, but if working with low voltage wires makes you nervous, just hire someone to install it. So, not a terrible install, but not plug and play.\n\nThe thermostat itself was easy to get connected up and registered. It has a mobile app, which I later installed, but we were able to connect to our Wi-Fi and get registered right from the thermostat display. Set up took just a couple of minutes and was mostly self explanatory. We mostly took the defaults, then went out to the web site later and looked through the options in more detail and did a little tweaking. In all, easy to configure.\n\nAnd it worked, first time out. We ran a couple of tests to make sure that AC and heat came on correctly, and we were on.\n\nPairing up the remote sensor was the easiest thing I've done in years. We went to the display menu, picked the option to add a sensor, and it immediately found the sensor and paired right up. Then we just placed the sensor where we wanted it. I hate the default name, but that's easy enough to change from the web site, so no big deal.\n\nIn all, we love the device. I think it's easier to use and smarter than the NEST.\n\nNow, the down side - getting this thing connected up with Alexa was annoying. Too many steps. Go to the Ecobee site and enable. Go to Alexa and add the skill. Search for devices. Wait, because everything doesn't register right away, but that's ok. but then how do you use the voice interface? Well, you have to figure it out. There's nothing in the instructions that tells you the commands, and no summary when you enable everything and set it up. I finally googled Alexa Ecobee4 commands and found a summary. Once you get through all the steps right (I missed finding devices the first time) and find the command summary, it works, but the verbal feedback is a little light. You can tell it to increase the temp on the thermostat by say 2 degrees and it will do so - but it doesn't tell you what the final temp is, so it's a little hard to tell if you've done what you intended to or not.\n\nIn all, a good value for the money, and I expect that some of these minor annoyances will be corrected over time."}
