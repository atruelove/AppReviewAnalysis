Perfect timing when the warranty just expired. What electronic devices that last less than two years now a day. There's definitely flaw in the circuit design that makes this device died prematurely. I used a UPS with surge protection so there shouldn't be a power surge that killed it. A pain was that I had to create new account and recreate the whole scenes and add all my Insteon devices all over again. Worse yet I need to use a different email account every time I set up a new hub. Stay away from this Insteon hub."}

I have spent two months working with customer support trying to work out scheduling issues to no avail. Have finally requested replacement of the Hub. Hopefully a new Hub will resolve the problem. If not, I have wasted a ton of money on Insteon devices that I can no longer adequately control in any automated manner. I cannot in good conscience recommend this product or any other Insteon product until they step up their game in product quality and customer support.\n\nNote: This is my second hub. The first died after three years!"}

I can't do anything useful there.\n- There is no documented direct-access to the device to automate things from, for example, a Raspberry Pi.\n\nOne might wonder, did they fire all their engineers after the first Proof-of-Concept."}

Without a Google home for voice control, this device would be useless, as the app interface is so slow and clunky, you'd rather get up and manually turn on/off whatever it is faster. A lot of the time Google would say \"an unexpected error occurred\" and you'd have to repeat the command again for it to work. Here we are just under 2 years later and a couple outlet/sensor failures, the hub literally blew up... A cap must've been slowly leaking or something, because all the solder joints were rusted and there was white smoke residue everywhere around a burnt spot on the PCB. Had been transitioning to a Z-WAVE Plus ecosystem anyway over this year that has preformed flawlessly and can communicate across all kinds of open source platforms or different HUBs of your choosing. Bottom line, stay far away from this awful product."}

There are some unique things about insteon that get it closer to 3 stars than 2 for my application.\n\nFirst the good... if your looking for a decent way to schedule lighting, this is easy and offers some good options. You can even buy hard wired light switches to control anything in your house that uses a light switch. That\u2019s the main reason I purchased Insteon over others, and it\u2019s been nice to be able to control ceiling lights/fans with schedules as well as Alexa. Also this is likely more cost effective if you\u2019re trying to automate an entire house as opposed to one or two lamps.\n\nThe bad... Alexa control is pretty hit or miss, she has trouble finding devices 1/4 of the time and says the device isn\u2019t responding. That could be Alexa\u2019s fault, hard to tell, because when I use the insteon app it will control the device just fine. Overall the base unit signal to each module is pretty weak, so if you have a decent size house with a 200 amp breaker panel you will need a range extender or two. The App is pretty clunky and I feel it could be better, but to be fair it does it\u2019s job well enough. One of the hard wired dimmer switches I had craped out and I had to buy a new one, which sucked because they aren\u2019t cheap and you have to rewire the switch which is something I\u2019d prefer not to have to do considering the price of the modules.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re a DIYer that\u2019s tech savvy and have some extra money you\u2019re willing to spend so you don\u2019t have to get off the couch to hit a switch, then you should be able to handle it. I haven\u2019t tried any other systems, but I would think there are probably some more user friendly options out there if you just need a plug in lamp controller or two. If you\u2019re trying to control an entire house, this is likely cheaper, but you\u2019ll definitely need some patience."}

I purchased this hub because my original hub stopped working, totally dead. When I received this one to replace the failed one I found out that in order to setup the new hub I would have to start from scratch. Yes, you can't just login to your account and add a new hub. There is no way to restore from a backup or anything. If I only had a couple of devices that would be fine but I have around 20 devices around the house, no easy task to go re-install again. After searching the web I found that there is a capacitor that fails on the control board. I was able to replace the capacitor and my old hub came back to life.\nI have contacted Insteon support and asked that they provide some method to backup the hub so that if needed one can restore to a new one. So far NOTHING! Since the communications protocol used by Insteon is proprietary, they are the only ones making these products. I am now in the process of looking for alternative solutions that use a more open standard and that is supported by several vendors.\nOn the bright side, this does work very well with the Amazon Echo and having voice command of my lights is very handy.\nHope this helps."}

Look, I don't know if I've ever negatively reviewed something purchased from Amazon, but I feel obligated to caution folks: being mislead has really ticked me off I must say. Apart from my emotions on this, the advice holds true to use another platform like Samsung (i.e., Z-Wave or Zigbee) if you have a \"regular person's\" size house (wink-wink)."}

The App is poorly made, in my opinion. Quite confusing going from one setting to another. The plus side of the Insteon system is that Insteon outlet can control and dim your lamps, which you would typically need a dimmer control if you went with a ZB solution. Scene was great, as it can automate based on your settings. Basically, all things would work well if, well, they're configured properly and you no longer need to add anything to your setup. However, in my case where my hub completely crapped out on me, well, good luck buddy as none of your Insteon switches/dimmers will work. That's one great thing about ZB, as there's a wide range of support, as seen in Amazon Echo Plus and Samsung Smartthings.

Our neighbors tried doing the same with smart switches that are wi-fi based but ended up spending hundreds of dollars in extending their wi-fi signals because the signals didn't get to where they had wall switches. We love our wi-fi which is why I chose Insteon. It uses some blend of radio and electrical wire signals to get around walls and travel really far. Also, the Insteon switches all repeat signals so the more you add, the stronger things get - exact opposite with wi-fi switches."}

One of those sensors saved our basement when we were on vacation, and I was a very happy camper. But over the years, I was frustrated by the many limitations with the hub, like lack of geo-fencing, Google Home linkage, and basic if/then logic that come standard in other hubs. I saw this new Insteon hub on a giant sale, and decided to upgrade. Installing the new Insteon hub was a giant pain. I couldn't save my old device/scene/room setup, and had to manually re-enter everything (1/2 day wasted). Worse, when I tested several of my old sensors, I found that neither the old or new hub would detect a low battery state. I've had a bunch of mini-bricks in my house for months/years. Now that it's installed, I'm getting lots of false positives from a motion sensor, and it keeps losing connectivity with my router. And, reading the reviews, it seems many have complained about the reliability of this hub. Yikes!! I've sent it back, and since moved on to the SmartThings hub, which supports a ton of ZigBee and Zwave sensors, and is a lot easier to setup and use."}

I had the old wall plug hub in the old house and now the new hub in my new house. I control lots of lights, pool pump, fans, water detectors - I guess 30 devices all in all. With so many devices talking and transmitting the network is rock solid. If the hub gives a command, it is always followed.\n\nI find the design of the hub ok. Mine died like others and after reading the boards I bought a bag of C7 switching CAPs and replaced the C7 and all is right with the world. I measured the one that came out. It had only 10% of the strength as the one I put in. Now I have 200 years worth of CAPs. I think the duty cycle for the C7 CAP is pretty hard. But I didn\u2019t loose all my programming and all is cool.\n\nI find the software functional - that\u2019s about it. We should be able to use our own icons and change colors. What we have is boring and for my old eyes I can\u2019t tell the difference between one button and the next if I choose the same graphic. The house-rooms-scenes thing works ok. I see other users complaining that they can\u2019t set two scenes to start at the same time, like sunset. What\u2019s the big deal? You just creat a sunset scene and put everything it it you want. Then if you want things to turn off, say 11 pm and then sunrise you create an 11 pm off scene and a sunrise off scene and put the devices you want in there. I think people over think things sometimes.\n\nThe hacking bothers me. I read that it\u2019s possible. Is it true? Smarthome should tell us. Smarthome updates the software automatically from time to time. No action on my part. I never notice. Everything is controlled through the internet. So if that goes down, your phones and iPads won\u2019t be able to control it. But that\u2019s not often. I also think that we use Smarthome\u2019s servers. Does that mean that Smarthome knows what all of it\u2019s products are doing?\n\nAdding devices is a snap, especially the more you add. Push a button, hear a beep, follow the directions on your iPhone.\n\nAll in all I appreciate its design and how it controls lights, keeps track of when sunrise and sunset is, and just works .. except when you loose C7,which is every 2-3years."}

I then used the Alexa App \"Smart Home\" section to connect the Insteon devices and quickly had voice command of the lights for On/Off and intensity. One set of lights indicated it was connected but wouldn't actually respond to Echo or iPhone inputs, but I soon realized that was due to the light having a \"3-way\" setup and I had linked the Slave switch instead of the Master. After correcting that error all worked as planned.\nI am pleased enough to start ordering Insteon swiitches and plug-ins to replace my X-10 switches. Many reviews complain of the short service life of the Insteon gear. In my experience, with 4 wall switches, I have had no problem in around 10 years of service.

Here are a couple of tips", "Text": "I had an older hub 2242-222 and a fairly extensive Insteon installation but wanted the Amazon Echo support, so I got this kit to get the new hub and got the included wall modules for dirt cheap compared to the price of just the new hub alone. Given all the mixed reviews I was concerned, but so far I am very pleased. Here are a couple of tips:\n\n1) I kept the older 2242-222 hub to keep the X10 and HouseLinc support, but I completely removed the old app config on the cloud and deleted the account before installing the new hub. I did have to use HouseLinc to clean up some stranded device links after deleting the old app account.\n2) Then I installed the new hub, created a new account, and set everything up with the app.\n3) I used the iPhone app to do the setup and it went well. The Windows Phone app was too buggy to do setup and the Android app gets negative reviews so I did not even try it. So I used the iPhone app for setup, and am glad I did. Except for some long waits while setting up scenes, it was painless.\n4) I have a mix of old (no extended commands) and new devices, and had no problem at all using the old devices with the new hub. Setup of the old modules did require being physically at the devices (all wired-in switches) to push the setup button as instructed by the app to discover and configure them and create scenes.\n\nThe new hub either came with or immediately updated to the latest firmware version (1013 as of this writing) before I did the setup so maybe that is one reason I had no trouble.\n\nThe link to the Echo does not correctly show the scenes; it shows them, but as devices instead of scenes. I also created some groups in the Echo skill to mimic the scenes, so I'm not sure which it is using for voice commands, but it does work as intended (\"Alexa, turn on entry lights\" works, where entry lights is a scene and entry is a group.)"}

The warranty on it is 1 year. A stationary, set-it-and-forget-it device that has no moving parts and you never physically interact with it can just up and stop working. Pretty cool!\n\nIn the time that it was actually working, it made dealing with outlets and switches easier than some of the Windows-based automation programs. It allowed me to see those devices in Alexa once I bought one of those and the control from there was pretty slick. It's also nice that even with the hub dead (and sitting on my desk, unplugged), that the switches and outlets continue to work. Other systems don't do that. The downside of that nice fact is that if I were to buy a new hub, I'd have to redo every single thing about my setup. Considering you sign in with an account, that's pretty crazy that the configuration isn't stored somewhere.\n\nEither way, buy this if you have Insteon devices and want to control them without running software on your computer."}

Things start to fail within a year, and subsequently I need to replace switches, etc within the 2-3 years that I have them. Initially, they are pretty amiable in terms of replacing the product. Soon, I discovered the front office/customer service in the factory store pretty much tells me to go to hell, in one conversation, they are saying, nothing last forever, you can't get things for free in this life. Well definitely I agree, nothing is free, while instead is cheaper than other home automation in the market, it's still pretty pricey and I also agree that nothing last forever but I'm hoping my light switch last more than 1 or 2 years because I have more than 30 light switches and sockets, and if I need to change several switches every other month, i'd rather go to other vendors who stands behind their products and is willing to respect that there's manufacturing defects.

They supplied me with a new replacement hub, so my system is back up and running. Hopefully the issue that I and a number of other reviewers encountered was just with that one production run. Changing my review to four stars.\n\n*ORIGINAL REVIEW*\nI purchased this system to control some of the lights in my home, and to have more solid control over lighting scenes while traveling (for home security). My Insteon hub had worked nicely for over a year, when I received an Amazon Echo last Christmas. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the hub model I had was echo compatible, which made the setup exponentially more useful. No more fumbling to take out my phone, unlock it, and wait for an app to load just to turn the lights on or off, I could just talk to the echo to control everything. There were occasional disconnects where the Echo would report \"The Insteon hub is not responding\", but not often enough to really inconvenience me.\nJust this past week however, the hub died completely and suddenly. It won't power on, and the reset button does nothing. I'll be reaching out to Insteon support to see if they'll help, but I expect my device is well past its warranty period. I don't relish putting another $60 into this system, at that point I'll be more likely to move on to the Samsung SmartThings system. I believe that two years is entirely too short a lifespan for this type of technology, and it seems that other reviewers are reporting a dead hub at around the two year mark as well.\nIf Insteon is able to replace or repair the hub, I'll update this review to reflect the service experience."}

It has some quirks but I like it so when I bought a vacation home I decided to put their products in there as well. That's when I discovered the issues.\n\nIn a nutshell, they do not create applications for all platforms on a equal basis. As an example they have a feature to allow for multiple homes. What they don't tell you is that it doesn't work on Android devices at all. Most features work on the Windows app and it appears all features work on IOS. I'm definitely not an Apple guy so that's a problem.\n\nIn general I found their code is a bit buggy. As an example they have light sensors that you can use to make decisions about turning things on and off. The problem is the senor works off a point of light intensity not a range. So if the light level is right at that point it rapidly switches back and fourth between on and off turning things on and off rapidly in your home.\n\nYou also need to be cautious with their support. They respond in a reasonable time frame but their answers are somewhat vague. I'm an IT professional with over 30 years experience. When I ask a technical question from a technical person I expect something more than yes or no answers. I realize I'm doing things here that are probably out of the norm but when I can come up with better ways to use their products than their technical support staff can that's an issue.\n\nThere are other minor things I could site. I still like their stuff and will continue to use it. But before you get into this you need to really think about what you want to accomplish and then how you want to do it."}

On a new installation, the setup is probably reasonable, but I was replacing an aging Insteon hub that would randomly fail to actuate controllers and switches. My replacement installation was difficult and tedious. First I had to individually remove all the devices from my account, and then set up a new account. Once my new account was set up, I had to manually add each device back into my new account and type in a new schedule for each device. Insteon does not explain the replacement procedure, and I had to search the Insteon support group for an explanation of the correct hub replacement process. One particularly annoyance was adding the two I/O sync devices for my garage door openers. I had to remove the I/O sync devices from my garage ceiling electrical outlets and connect them to the same electrical outlet that the new hub was plugged into. Once the two I/O synch devices were plugged into the same outlet as the hub, the hub was able to discover them and I could add them to my account. I probably spent 6 hours replacing the hub and reinstalling my 12 devices. I suspect the problem for the I/O synch devices was that the garage branch circuit was out of phase with the branch circuit that the hub was attached to. I caught a special 30% off sale for the hub so I was overall pleased with the replacement hub, but anyone considering replacing their old Insteon hub should be forewarned that it may be a time consuming and annoying process."}

{"Author": "Christopher L. Barber", "Date": "on October 19, 2017", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "This is what you get when you let children write software", "Text": "My biggest complaint about this incredibly immature device is the software. There is absolutely no comprehension of decent architecture in this thing. And yet from a hardware/technical perspective it's probably better than most. Multi-mode communication (RF+powerline), more features, more flexible, etc. The downside is that the protocol is proprietary, so you won't be connecting your zigbee or zwave gadgets to this. But back to the so-called software... I don't even know where to begin, this thing is so lame it's laughable. I'll start with most epic fail I've found so far: the device must have a lat-long position provided by the app via GPS in order to correctly set its own time zone. If you configure the device by running the app on (for example) a tablet with no GPS, you'll go through the whole \"set your location\" thing, pointing to your house on a map, and it will read back your exact address including zipcode, yet it fails to figure out what time zone you're in even with all that information at hand, and further fails to tell you that this is the case. So you, like so many others who have asked the same question in countless forum posts, are left wondering why your hub thinks it's 5 am when in fact it's actually (fill in the blank) in your local time and (if you're lucky) the porch lights are turning on at noon instead of at local sunset. As for me, I couldn't get a scheduled even to occur even when I compensated for the incorrect time zone.\n\nSo I figured that was the case, and redid the location setup using an iphone instead of a non-gps tablet, and sure enough as soon as the location was set, the hub time changed to match local time and programmed schedules starting working. This serves to point out a couple of secondary deficiencies in this amateurish design:\nThere is no way to edit the local time\nThere is no way to edit the time zone - in fact, there is no feedback of the time zone at all. If the app would just tell you what time zone it thought it was in, even the most novice user would recognize that something might not be right.\n\nGeneral app design - very incohesive, more like a random collection of screens than an integrated application. My biggest gripe in this area is the fact that you can't edit anything without going to the Settings page. We have a page for Rooms, a page for Scenes, a page for whatever, but whatever is on those pages should have a button you can touch to edit the thing. Here's an example: Click into the Rooms page, click into a room, see a page full of devices. What can you do with these devices? Nothing more than the basic function of the device, such as on/off if it's a switch. How about being able to change the name or other properties of the device right there? Not happening. You have to go to the Settings menu, then into Devices, then something else, it's just a giant hassle. Same with Scenes. Settings -> Scenes -> choose a scene -> edit it. Most of this crap on the settings page has nothing to do with settings. If I want to change what a scene does, the most obvious place to do that would be on the Scenes page. There's my scene, press and hold on the scene, go to edit mode. But that's just fantasy.\n\nThe list of rooms you create seems to have no ability to be ordered into any logical order. Even on the most outdated phone I can drag icons around to order them on a screen to suite my preferences. Not happening on this thing. I think they show up in whatever random order it occurred to you to created them in. So you might want to think that through a bit before starting in on it.\n\nApparently they took some shortcuts with the data structures used to represent schedules because it seems that two separate schedules cannot have events that are programmed to occur at the same time. I set up one schedule with an on-time set for sunset. Then, on another device or scene, I created another schedule which was meant to have an on-time of sunset, but a different off-time. The app responded with an error message telling me I couldn't have the same on-time and that I should either adjust the time or put the device in the other scene. Wtf? It's pretty obvious they're driving the schedule off a list of times where they expect to find only one unique instance of a specific time in the list. Really lame.\n\nThere seems to be no end to the stupidities I find in the app that drives this thing. The hardware's pretty good. I've read a lot of people complaining about poor longevity in the remote controlled devices. It's likely true, but consider that these are essentially digital microcontrollers and radios powered directly off of the utility line voltage in a tiny, tiny box where there is no room for a decent power supply with good transient suppression, isolation, etc. These things are prime candidates to be killed by voltage surges.\n\nOh, the remote control switches and things all come with stranded wire which you are supposed to connect to your solid 14 ga in-wall wiring. Really bad choice. This stuff is not meant to be twisted up in a wire nut. You have to be very careful to get a tight connection. Then on the other hand, the little micro on/off switch (\"micro\" is a fairly optimistic term) has screw-clamp terminals - much better choice - but the barrels of the terminals are so short you can only get about 3/16\" of bare copper in the hole without leaving exposed copper outside the hole. Honestly, I don't think these people have any real understanding of electricity.\n\nOr software, obviously."}

I'm using it simply for dusk-to-dawn security light controls, but I'll also run Christmas lights using it during the Holiday season. Note that setting up a group of Insteon switches is much simpler than with no hub or controller since you can set up the hub and switches using the switches' Insteon addresses instead of having to run around the house manually setting them. In fact, I set each switch into the system using a test rig next to the hub to ensure that it worked before I installed the switches in their final locations."}

These hubs are slow, unreliable, have not been updated in several years. Once you go through all of the setup for a device which is slow and tedious in a poorly thought out app and finally after you have it all working just the way you want you might be happy for a while. When Alexa integration was announced it was always faster to ask Alexa to turn something off/on than it was to open the app, wait for it to stop spinng on all your devices and click on the device to turn it off. I had my hub for a couple of years and thoughI dreaded entering the app to add a new device, I have accumulated nearly 50 devices in our home now. Many of them hardwired. One is 3 stories high controlling the coach lights on our garage. Very cool, until two days ago, the hub failed.

The hub comes with two switches and was very easy to install. This product is one of the best in the league of home automation products. because of its sleek design it looks good on my walls and doesnt lost its connection as my nest devices used to do. This product is very good for beginners who want to automate there homes.Planning to buy more products from this family. The best part is, it is compatible with my amazon echo dot and the response time is very less. As compared to other automation hubs available online this one has the best value for money. Day by day there network is growing and the hub is getting compatible with other electronic locks and motion sensors. overall its a great product for begineers and definately worth it.\nketan sharma"}

The hub failed and I have 20 devices counting on this so I ordered it over night to replace the dead one. I contacted Insteon and if I could find my proof of purchase the will give me a new on as the warranty is 2 years. I set this on up and with help from Insteon on the phone I finally got it to work. There is no documentation on how to replace a failed hub. You have to call.\nThat is part of why I gave it only 2 stars.\n\nThe helped me and gave me an Excel spread sheet with most of the device information I needed to set up the hub. It took over an hour to get it back to working. Some devices require you to be at the device to set up.\n\nThis is the other reason. I have 2 Echo dots, a touch and a full size Echo. After I got them set up I tested their connection with my Echo devices. I deleted the old ones, asked Alexa to find the devices and the Alexa app did. What it didn't do is work. There were six devices that showed in my Alexa app that Alexa would tell me she couldn't find. I emailed for Amazon support and got a quick reply telling me to call. I called and got a representative who had no idea what I was talking about. She had never heard of Insteon devices. I had to repeat the name frequently, spell it and all she did was have me do things I already had done and then she was stuck. She bumped me up the line to a man who immediately told me that I had to contact Insteon for help. When I inquired why since it was Alexa who failed to find the devices, but who found them in the Alexa App he just continued to brush me off. It was rude and not very helpful since the Insteon Hub and Insteon App worked, and Alexa didn't. I finally hung up after he repeated the same thing to me again and would not listen or answer my question.\n\nIf I knew 2 years ago what I know now I would have tried some other device to make my home smart and I would not have bought 4 Echo devices since the support is weak at best."}

However, my system recently stopped working for no apparent reason and after spending a couple hours on the phone with Insteon Customer Service the representative stated that he had determined that my hub (2242-222) had failed and needed to be replaced; he suggested I replace it with the 2245-222 which is what came in this Starter Kit. Upon installation of the new hub, I had the SAME ERRORS! Then I was told the PC based control (HouseLinc) was no longer supported and that I would now be able to set up everything on my phone, and that it would be very easy. I asked about all the scenes I have created for the 35 Insteon devices I'm running and was told I would have to recreate them, but that I can do it on my phone and it would be very easy... So, with step by step instruction with Customer Service on the line, I connected to two of my devices in just over 45 minutes of frustration, and repetition. The technician kept suggesting that I probably need to buy a wifi extender, even though I explained to him several times that I'd been using the system for 3+ years without issue, and there were no recent changes in the home that would affect line signal nor WiFi signal. In fact, three other devices I was attempting to pair were within arm's reach of the hub, and on separate powerline phases (and I also have an Insteon powerline phase coupler)\nI was unable to pair ANY other devices.\nI kept this kit because the two dimmer modules would have cost me more than the kit, and I wanted those anyway. I've since upgraded my hub to the ISY994i/IR Pro. Now I'm back to setting things up with a PC (happily), and the new hub is working flawlessly with much more functionality than I had with the Insteon Hub.\n\nSide note; the Insteon tech guys can be very difficult to understand."}

I plugged the hub into my network and installed the dimmer modules with no issues. Once I figured out some of the initial settings on the dimmers, setting scenes was pretty easy. It's works with my Nest and Alexa. The one thing I did discover, if you want to use it with Alexa, keep the names of the lamps and scenes simple.\n\nI also was able to get this to work with IFTTT and Stringify. Both of these apps let you control your Insteon products based on something else as a trigger. For example, when my Nest goes into AWAY mode and it's after sunset, it will turn the living room light on so the house looks occupied. The possibilities are limitless when you integrate these apps.\n\nAnother selling point of the Insteon system is network security. A friend of mine has a WEMO, when I was at his house, on his wifi, I downloaded the WEMO app and was able to control his lights, change his programming, etc. The Insteon system requires a password to access. So you don't have to worry about friends or family messing with your lights.\n\nI will be buying more Insteon products because I like the safety and security they bring. I do wish they weren't so expensive tho."}

The Insteon uses it's own proprietary wireless protocol to communicate with connected products (in my case an Insteon dimmer switch). This is fine, it just means that the device needs to be connected to the network via an ethernet cable, which in my case is on the opposite side of my home and on a different floor than the switch it is controlling. The distance between the control hub and dimmer switch causes the hub to periodically lose connectivity with the switch, effectively disabling the ability to control the lights from my phone or amazon echo. The larger issue is that the Insteon app doesn't register the connectivity problems, and will simply hang when attempting to complete an action (such as dimming the lights) until the connection is established. It's mildly frustrating, and is direct bi-product of using proprietary protocols over conventional wifi standards to communicate with remote nodes.\n\nThe negative aspects aside, when the device is working the effect is pretty flipping awesome. I can tell my Amazon Echo to dial in any light level I want from 1-100%. You can even set the fade delay, so the transition between light level settings can be instant or dramatically slow. The app isn't quite as nice other smart home devices, but it works."}

Setting up scenes, schedules, and setting up devices as controllers for other devices is all extremely easy with the app.\n\nI love that I can connect to the hub from literally anywhere I have an internet connection to check the status of my Insteon devices.\n\nAnother big bonus for me is that this hub is extremely easy to control in Kodi if you are a home theater computer user. The add on CinemaVision lets you control Insteon scenes as a part of the movie experience. I did a write up on how to set it up over on the CinemaVision forum if anyone needs it.\n\nPros: easy setup; remote access is nice; so many options...\nCons; doesn't control X10"}

Upon calling tech support and finally getting someone on the phone I was able to get clear instructions on how to install everything. I wanted the hub in my Tech Closet out of sight with the rest of my hubs and servers, etc... Unfortunately there \"was too much noise on the electrical circuit.\" For the system to work and for the app to see and connect to the components it sends/receives signal through the house's electrical circuits. And with too much \"noise\" on that circuit in the closet the hub was not able to communicate effectively with the other components. The hub must have an ethernet connection to the router therefore WIFI is only used for the app to connect with the hub. Once I found a circuit with an ethernet connection near by (which is in my living room where everyone can see, much to the chagrin of my wife) I was actually able to get everything to work fine- for about a month. Now all of a sudden it stopped working for no reason. NOTHING HAS CHANGED!!!! I am done with this junk.

{"Author": "Chopper", "Date": "on March 8, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Very disappointing.", "Text": "I should have read the reviews more closely. I usually do but when I got an Alexa to get my Spotify client off my MacPro and learned that it supported my Insteon lighting I jumped without looking.\n\nLet me preface the review by noting that I've been an Insteon product user since the company's first releases. In fact, my house was all X10 protocol for years before Insteon became available and I replaced all those X10 devices with Insteon. For years I've been running my Insteon devices on my Mac Pro via the Indigo 6 software and an Insteon PowerLinc 2413U controller. I initially did run into issues with noisy lines (I have several computers here) and signals not bridging across the power legs but I added two pairs of repeaters to installation and those problems went away.\n\nI received the Hub last week and was initially stoked that it was so small and easy to install. It also managed to pair up with the internet and my phone without incident. I was a happy guy. My thrill was short-lived when it failed to recognize the first device I tried to install which was running fine under Indigo. Then the second. The third was successful. Then more misses.\n\nAfter trying to install 23 currently-working Insteon devices in my house the Hub managed to link to only 13 of them. I repeated the attempts over and over again. No luck.\n\nSo I called the Hub tech support number (without a doubt the noisiest and most obnoxious \"hold\" music I've ever experienced) and spoke with a drone who blindly walked me through a knowledge base tree, asking me several times to restate my problem, asking whether I'd tried doing something we'd already just done. Attention Span: zero. Example: \"Okay, you should uninstall and reinstall the phone app. That should fix it.\" \"Dood, you just had me do that five minutes ago and the only thing that happened was that I lost 45 minutes of work adding those devices!\" The call ended with the drone saying that he had nothing else to try and promising me that a senior engineer would call me the next day, which unsurprisingly did not happen.\n\nStay away from this product. Maybe it will work for a tiny apartment using simple lamp modules but it's definitely not capable of managing a larger and more diverse Insteon installation like I have here.\n\nIn addition, I received an email last week from Insteon announcing updates to this product and was told to expect them to be installed automatically between May 2 and May 5. I was hoping this might fix at least some of the issues with this device. However, here is it May 7 and no updates were received.\n\nSix months later: I did another Hub update. It still fails to recognize half of my Insteon installation even though Indigo has no problems with it. Hopefully a competitor will see the potential market here because this company has clearly has no interest in fixing its broken product."}

A simple task like turning on two lights at the same time is a pain - you must create a \"scene\" with both devices to turn on at the same time, then it gets more cumbersome if you want them to turn off at different times. Another annoyance is there is no adjustment for sunset or sunrise to fine tune the times for your exact location. Other software such as X10, allow you to enter minutes before or after, from the pre-programmed times. Like I mentioned, I'd give the hardware a 5 star rating, but software is no more than a two star rating. Update - software is horrible, not at all user friendly, software is zero stars.

Nice Product, Bad Support, Snotty Help Agent.", "Text": "The Insteon hub and 2 plug kit is a terrific deal. I noticed the price had even dropped a bit one day, so I grabbed the starter kit. It was easy to set up, but when it came to integrating with Alexa, I wasn't sure what I needed to do. There was a nice flyer in the box with their customer service number on it, which I liked. So many companies make it hard to talk to a human. So, I called and asked the agent how to connect Insteon to Alexa. He replied that Alexa isn't their product (rather smart-alecky, too). I told him I knew that, but there weren't any instructions included with the kit, so I needed some help. He again told me that Alexa isn't their product, so \"of course\" they wouldn't include instructions. Well, my TP-Link smart plug included instructions, I told him, and I didn't remember it being terribly difficult. He acted irritated and put me on hold, so he could download the Alexa app. He was not familiar with Alexa AT ALL! All the while, their hold recording keeps telling me how proud they are of working with Amazon's Alexa. While he had me on hold 5 minutes (Seriously?) to download an app, I dug out the TP-Link instructions and all I had to do was enable Insteon as a skill. So simple. Insteon customer service/tech support IS NOT TRAINED ON ALEXA INTEGRATION, AT ALL. So, although the product works very well, I dread the day I have a technical issue."}

Like many others that have reported, my hub died and has no power. Supposedly the C7 capacitor can be replaced and you might be able to get your hub working again. The bigger problem that is completely STUPID is that you cannot just download your hub configuration from the cloud to a new hub. WHAT?????!!!! Yep, you got it, you have to start over from scratch and it is recommended that you factory reset every single one of your Insteon devices. This is a big red flag that the design decisions at Smarthome have jumped the shark. I have a huge investment in Insteon but sadly will begin looking at migration alternatives off of this platform. The amount of time/effort I enjoy back from the automation is being sunk in managing the horrible design decisions being made by this company. At least my Elk configuration is still available and will be taking the duties back over from the silly Insteon hub design. One star because this appears to be a known issue with this device and starting from scratch is just wrong.\n\n______________________________________\n\nFor many years I've been using a very user unfriendly combination of Elk M1 Gold security panel coupled with a serial module flashed with supporting firmware and the abysmal ElkDroid app that was abandoned by its developer ($99 grrrrrr!!!!!!). The setup has worked but is very painful to use as you have to essentially re-add every device to the Elk if you lose or replace a module due to how it works. Additionally, the Elk does not support scenes and if too many devices are in a rule some or many will not receive or respond to the command. I purchased the hub for a whopping $15 even though the reviews were pretty poor. I have to say I have been nothing but pleased with it. I believe that Smarthome must have had serious issues with the hub at initial rollout and the reviews pretty much reflect a hub without the now updated firmware. Smarthome even notifies me when they plan to do maintenance and/or perform updates via email which is a pleasant surprise. Both the hub and the accompanying android app have allowed me to slowly start moving programming of time-based events off the Elk M1 Gold. The use of scenes is an added bonus which greatly speeds up delivery of commands to devices. Hope these comments help someone on the fence about this device."}

{"Author": "SGA", "Date": "on January 7, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Welcome to hell", "Text": "A bit of background: I'm highly technically capable in electronics, computers, etc. I had the Insteon Hub 2242-222 model with a bunch of lights, sensors, etc. working at my home for nearly a decade. It wasn't easy getting things to work back then, but after adding a couple of range extenders and playing with their locationsThis past Christmas (2016) I was given an Amazon Echo Dot as a gift. Turns out that you need this newer Insteon Hub 2245-222 if you want to control your home through the Echo (e.g. \"Alexa turn off the lights.\").\n\nSo, I bought the 2245-222 and the nightmare began. Since I already had a working Insteon network, I thought it would be easy to just switch out the old hub for a new one. Nope.\n\nFirst, you have to delete all of your scenes, then devices, then your account (why?!) from Insteon before installing this new hub. They recommend that you write down all your device IDs to help. Then, you need to create a new account and start re-linking your devices. (I'd recommend starting with your range extenders first.)\n\nHowever, this time around, these same devices that had been working well before are all having trouble being added through the app. Strangely enough, I can see and hear that they are all communicating with the hub when I press the setup buttons and/or toggle paddles. Yet, in the app, they never completely finish getting properly added. It either doesn't see the device, fails during some part of a 10-part test, or -as in the case of one of my two range extenders- it doesn't recognize the device properly. For example, that second range extender shows up as a device that uses an On/Off toggle rather than showing \"Active\" for its state.\n\nTrying to use the ID numbers that they recommended to save makes no difference. In fact, even with the ID numbers, it seems to have exactly the same issues. Of course, I've tried different outlet locations for the hub and the range extenders. I've tried using an Android and iOS devices to configure. And I've tried to be patient. Very patient. But, you can lose your patience with a product when their Help Line has wait periods of 30 minutes, 60 minutes, or 90 minutes. (Yes, I've tried calling during the weekday and the weekend.)\n\nI'll continue trying to make this work and reaching out to Insteon's tech support (if their wait times improve) and will post the progress here if it improves. But, at this point, I'm regretting my choice to use Insteon for my home automation.\n\nUpdate:\nAfter 3 days of re-configuring my Insteon network to get this to work with it, I finally have a new working solution for all devices except one light switch. There was even more trouble with getting the settings to configure properly on the IOLink module through both the iOS and Android versions of the Insteon for Hub app. The app wouldn't allow you to choose some of the options, even though they were the appropriate combinations for the purpose I was using it for (i.e. a garage door opener). Nevertheless, the correct options combinations sometimes randomly are available. It took me an hour of saving, exiting, editing and saving again, to finally have the correct options available to save the IOLink module configuration.\n\nWorse, after all this which was to allow Alexa to control my Insteon devices, I find out that the IOLink module isn't supported through Alexa. WTF. If the Alexa \"skill\" has access to the Hub, then it should be able to control everything that the Hub controls. But, no.\n\nMy only guess as to why the Insteon skill for Alexa doesn't support the IOLink module and some other devices is because of a potential security risk. Imagine someone walking up to your window and saying, \"Alex, open the garage door!\". Okay, I get that...though I'd rather have the option to secure my system myself. But, why Insteon couldn't build this Hub to learn the previous configuration, I have no idea. Why Insteon couldn't build it to be a drop-in-replacement for the prior hub version, again, I'm at a loss to understand. Why Insteon's app is so crappy, there's no excuse for. Unfortunately for me, I have spent a considerable investment in Insteon's home automation devices, so it's a bit late for me to switch."}

However, there is a defect where if after you don't use it for a few hours, the first time you ask Alexa to turn the lights on or off it DOES actually turn them on or off, but you get an error message instead of the standard \"Ok\" message. The error says the device is not responding and to check the power supply and network connection. Clearly both of those are fine since the light does turn on or off. The error message is very annoying.\n\nContacted Insteon support who acknowledged they've heard of this issue but they said they couldn't replicate it locally. They offered zero options or suggestions. Looking online I see other people have the same issue. Why the company is playing it off as not being a problem simply because they can't replicate it locally (if that is really the case) is beyond me. Will be returning this within the next few days if they don't respond back with some more appropriate next steps.\n\nThis was a lower priced product from other brands, and I certainly feel like I got what I paid for. My mistake."}

Once you don't expect much from them, you'll be satisfied. Not happy, just satisfied. The Windows 10 platform apps (mobile and desktop) seem to have an issue disconnecting devices from scenes. The interface is nice enough, but compared to HouseLinc (the prior version that was a desktop app) you lose at least 70% of the features. For example, you can't really inspect device links like you can in HouseLInc, the Sunset/Sunrise times just don't work for timers, you are unable to set ramp rates for switches, it barely works with KeypadLinc switches. Overall it's a reasonably reliable replacement for a PLM, but if you're expecting Houselinc v3, forget it."}

The Insteon product line is extensive and, I feel, covers every need one would have while automating their home. That is why I gave two stars. However the real concern was with their hub and technical support. Or I should say a burned-up hub and lack of response from technical support.\n\nMy Hub: While trying to figure out why our automated lights would not turn on one day I noticed the hub was non-responsive. I tried\u2026 un-plug/plug back in, new outlet on the surge strip, new surge strip, new wall outlet, new power cord. That\u2019s when I noticed faint brown spots covering the entire bottom and some on the top of the case. While I was looking closely I caught the familiar \u201cburned up\u201d smell. That\u2019s when I opened the case. Just from what I can see, there are three components and five spots on the circuit board that are burned through. That worried me.\n\nTheir Support: I used Insteon\u2019s website (the only option I could find) to send them an email request to replace the hub - twice. Each time I received a confirmation from their website but I did not receive a confirmation email nor did I ever heard back from their support team. Once again - this happened twice.\n\nIt\u2019s these two reasons together that prompted me to leave such a poor review. I understand electronics need electricity and electricity can burn things up but to me a lack of support or even a response from their support team is what ruined this vendor for me. I can provide picture of the burned up hub if needed.\n\nUPDATE: 01/10/2017 = Shortly after posting the above review I (interestingly enough) got an email from Insteon support. The end result (w/o too many details) is they went above-and-beyond to take care of my situation. They replaced my hub for free and even shipped the new unit overnight. This experience has restored my faith in Insteon's Tech Support. I will once again buy from them in the future and suggest their products to others."}

{"Author": "John", "Date": "on December 11, 2016", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Big improvement over X10, software needs updating", "Text": "My first impression of the Insteon 2245-222 hub is that it's a great improvement over the old X10 powerline controllers, which had issues with missed signals and limited range. Using RF signals, I can now turn lights on and off reliably, as well as dim them using the Insteon for Hub app or the RF remote control. No more guessing as to whether it will work the first time. That's a big improvement. Programming light intensity levels is easy, and the ability to create scenes is a real time saver for frequently used settings. I also like being able to schedule lights to come on at sunset, and to turn them off at a preset time. Here's where the problem lies with the Insteon for Hub software. After setting the scheduler, the on / off times do not work as expected. In my case, there is an 8 hour offset between the hub time and the actual local time. The hub location says Los Angeles, which is in the correct time zone, but the hub time is 8 hours later. The scheduler events are based on the hub's internal clock, so they happen 8 hours earlier than expected. The suggested fix is to reset the hub location, but when I try to do that under Settings, House, Location, the Insteon for Hub app crashes every time. It shows the locator map for a fraction of a second, then crashes. I see this same behavior on a Samsung Galaxy tablet and an Alcatel smartphone. Also, when I click on the \"Observe DST\" button, I see the message, \"Updating hub time\" momentarily, however there is no change to the original \"Off\" state. There needs to be a reliable way to set the local time in order for the scheduler to work properly. Hopefully this can be addressed through a hub firmware or app software update. My Insteon hub currently has version 1010 firmware and the Insteon for Hub app software version is 1.9.4. An improved web interface to the hub with a settings menu would also be nice, but right now, I'll settle for just having the correct time.\n\nUPDATE: I found a way to prevent the Insteon for Hub app from crashing. The app only crashes while setting my hub location if the Android phone's GPS is turned off. I turned on the GPS, repeated the location setup, and this time, the hub's location and time were finally updated to correct values. It would be nice if you could set the location manually in the event that there is no working GPS on the Android device, but the app exits before you can get to that point. Nevertheless, I am upgrading my review rating to four stars since the hub time and scheduler are now working. I did notice the \"Observe DST\" button still doesn't work. It's always off when running the app."}

I was trying to make a single scene to turn on at sunrise and off at 8am Monday-Friday. This part worked perfectly. The problem occurred when I tried to create a second scene for Saturday and Sunday to turn on at 8am. It claimed there was a scheduling conflict and that I could not create a scene to turn on at 8am when there was another scene set to turn off at the same time but on entirely different days. Insteon's support site claimed I would get a response within 48 hours but instead it took 7 days to get a response where the technician essentially told me to change the Saturday/Sunday on time to 8:30 instead of 8am. I replied back saying that would allow me to create the new scene but was not an acceptable resolution. Two weeks later, still no response so I called their support phone number and was told just to make the new scene 1 minute later instead which was still unacceptable.\n\nAnother issue I had with it was the lack of functionality of either their Android or Windows interface. When creating a schedule or scene, you have to advance the hours and minutes manually up or down one unit at a time instead of being able to type in the time you want. For example, if the time is displayed as 5:28 and you want to change it to 11:00, the easiest way would be to click the down arrow for minutes 28 times, and then the up arrow for hours 6 times. There was no keypad entry option available.\n\nNeedless to say, based on those issues alone I can see there being lots of other issues if I were to get deeper into home automation. I've returned the product and will be looking at other alternatives to Insteon. Definitely can't recommend or say anything positive about the product."}

This is just a controller, and doesn't do anything by itself. You plug it into an ethernet port, and into your house power. It communicates with other Insteon devices primarily using your house's power lines (it sends data over your house's power wires). It connects to the internet through the ethernet, of course. You can do things with the insteon hub using computer programs, a smartphone app, and Amazon Echo. It's cloud-accessible, so you can use your phone's smarthome app from anywhere in the world to see what's turned on, and control your home. You also have an interface that makes it easy to program schedules and triggers -- e.g. Turn off all the lights at 10:00pm, or when you open a door make lights turn on automatically -- if you have all the necessary insteon devices.\n\nThis kit also comes with two dimmer controls. These plug into your wall (remember, insteon uses home power to communicate with the hub) and you plug a dimmable light into this controller. You can use the hub (from a computer, smartphone app, Amazon Echo) to turn power on and off and provide dimmer control to these controllers.\n\nOther Insteon Devices you can buy (not in this kit) include: Garage door controllers & sensor. Water sensors. Smoke & CO detectors. Thermostat. There are also cameras, but those are more a combination of network and insteon devices."}

Here is my experience...\n\nFirst, some background. I have been using Insteon devices since their inception. I have probably spent $10,000 on the product with mixed results. I used these in 2 larger homes (2,500 and 4,500sf). I now live in a small apartment in a 100 year-old building. The wiring is new, but everything is in metal boxes and conduit)\n\nI had 3 leftover Insteon LED bulbs so I thought I would try this out. I also have a Nest thermostat (don't tell the landlord). I thought I would \"risk\" 65 bucks on this, since it was the least expensive solution out there - by far.\n\n1) Initial setup was flawless. The app takes a photo of the hub's QR code and does the rest. You set up an account in about 2 minutes.\n2) found the LED bulbs with no issues are all. Just remember to search, then turn the bulbs on so they can send their \"Hey!\" signal to the hub.\n3) Insteon app is clean, simple and intuitive. I have seen some nasty programs - this is simple.\n4) Works fantastically with the Nest - no problems here.\n5) It hasn't missed a signal yet and I played with it for hours.\n6) setting up on other iDevices is a simple as loading the app and signing on. period.\n\nHere's the one I don't understand. It had remote access right out of the box. No port forwarding, no DNS. It just worked. It will remote access the devices and check status via internet with no complicated setup.\n\nThis has been the best Insteon product I have seen yet.\n\nThis model is not compatible with Apple HomeKit (which I wanted). After setting it up, it seems like HomeKit is just an extra and unneeded step in the process, since Siri never understands me anyway. The other Insteon hub is HomeKit enabled but seems to have a lot less features. Make sure you pick the one that suits your application.\n\nOther people seem to have had difference experiences.

I found out that our whole house has no neutral wires in the switch boxes. If a neutral on the same circuit breaker is nearby (like in an outlet), you can fish it to the switch box and use it. That worked in a couple instances. Otherwise order the \"2-wire\" Insteon dimmers, if you have a 3-way or 4-way, find the hot switch box and install the 2-wire dimmer there, then add a mini remote paddle switch in the other switch boxes so it looks and functions normally."}

Apparently, it requires a mobile app to operate it; there might be a desktop application for it, but I did not look for it. I have come to believe that the iPhone/iPad (which I use) support is superior than that of Android. This requires AC power and a wired RJ45 Ethernet connection (this is a typical network cable) and comes with a network cable.\n\nIt is VERY easy to link devices with this Hub, especially in comparison to the ISY99 products, however, that is the extent of its superiority to the ISY99. It can \"automate\" devices with a very limited schedule - all I could figure out was a SINGLE schedule per device for which you can choose an On time, Off time, and which days of the week. It supports scenes (a \"scene\" is a group of devices that are acted upon simultaneously), each of which has its own schedule, so you could create a scene with just one device and have more schedules.\n\nThe iPhone mobile app is fairly responsive and easy to use, but very simplistic. For example, when you choose thermostat, it shows one thermostat, but I have two - so, I created a \"room\" (a group of devices - you create \"rooms\" and assign devices to them, a device can be in more than one \"room\") called Thermostats and put both of my mine in that room.\n\nThis is a good device for the casual user, however, you want more complex programming, such as knowing \"today\" is a holiday so don't turn on the bathroom lights at 5:30am, then you would want the ISY. I use both because the Insteon Hub's mobile is so easy to use to just turn things on and off.\n\n4 of 5 stars because of the limited programming."}

You don't NEED the app on your phone or Windows 8 computer, but it makes life easier (and even then, the app is junk - but this isn't a review on the app) - the instructions provided don't detail how to do the setup without the App, but there are instructions online. The two lamp switches that come are 2-prong and are slim enough, configured so that you can still use the upper plug on a 2-plug receptacle with the switch plugged into the lower. They also have a green / red LED to show when they are supposed to be on / off, which will help with troubleshooting.\n\nThe bad - the App sucks as mentioned above. The devices don't always do what they're supposed to do, sometimes the buttons on the sides don't work, and some times you need to reboot the system to get it all back to normal. The devices also allow a small amount of power through, even when \"off\" so if you have LED bulbs in whatever it's controlling, you'll notice a slight glow. It isn't enough to get a glow out of a regular bulb. I have been told that this charge is to monitor the on/off status of the lamp itself, so if you turn on or off the lamp from the lamps physical switch, the Insteon plug will notice this and turn itself on or off - I haven't seen that happen yet despite trying a few times. This means if you want to turn on the light, you either need to use the App (which isn't great), push the button on the side of the insteon plug (which may be behind a couch or piece of furniture), or install an Insteon remote switch to act as a controller for the lamp (not cheap).\n\nDespite all of this, I'm still happy with it. I have one in the living room and one in the bedroom. I have the one in the living room set to scenes (from the app) so it comes on in the mornings and evenings as it gets dark outside. The one in the bedroom comes on just before my alarm to help me get up. And if I turn it on before bed, I can find my way to bed in the light and then turn it off from the bed using the app on my phone. I've also found that as I add more devices to the house, the mesh network gets stronger - each Insteon device acts as a repeater for signals, so the more the merrier.\n\nAll in all, I think the Insteon hardware is pretty solid - their software is what needs some love, and I hope they start investing more into that side of the business, because great hardware with crummy user interface is worthless."}

The Home control starter kit here kit comes with the Insteon hub and two plug (two bladed socket) dimmer modules for lamps. I also purchased two of the 8 watt Insteon bulbs. Some important things to know:\n\n1) There is an app for Windows on your PC - AND for Windows Phone (I'm using Windows for Mobile 10). It worked with bulbs and plugin dimmers and I've done on-off-and dim as a test for each of my four devices. It isn't just for android and iPhone. (YAY!) Note: I was told the reason I couldn't set my location and local hub time was because I was using windows, however support was able to do this for me remotely using my hub's password < which I was asked to provide them with.\n2) You should plug your hub into an actual wall outlet, you can use an extension cord but NOT a power strip (it messes with the signal)\n3) You will need to plug this into a network port (hub, router, or wall) using the included RJ45 jacked cable. There is no Wi-Fi option.\n4) When you download the app- bring a single device online at a time. You have to start the add device process before plugging in or screwing in bulb then it'll auto-discover.\n5) It helps to use your phone/pc near the hub and device when setting up -- there's a timeout during set up you don't want to run to another room.\n6) Give your devices simple easy to use names\n7) Discover your devices from within the Alexa App\n8) Call out 'Alexa Living Lamp On' or use options like Off - dim to 50% - set to 100% - dim to 80% etc.\n9) Using the insteon app it's easy to schedule On/Off times or set schedule by night/day. Be sure to save your change in each window or it loses changes when you go back to the root scheduling page for the device. Aka- set On time and save- then go back and set off time and save.\n10) Dual Band devices like the plugins in this kit are basically signal strengtheners/repeaters. Install your closest Dual Band devices closest to the hub before installing devices farther from the hub unit.\n\nAlso - the closer you are to the hub the faster the response to your commands. I found within 15 ft, a 2 count occurs between requesting and executing a command. At a distance of probably 54 ft a 4 count occurs between request and execution. I have Alexa placed centrally within my home (which has an open hall/kitchen/living/dining concept). My hub is about 14 feet from Alexa in a direction opposite most of my 2101sqft home. At a distance of about 30 feet from Alexa, down a hallway and through a wall I was able to activate a voice command for a device about 54ft from the hub, with three walls between the device and hub. I haven't tried any farther than this, yet.\n\nOn a whole I was so emboldened by the freedom this product provides and the ease of setup I already have one more bulb, a thermostat, an outlet, and several dimmer and on/off switches on order. Currently I only have one device in any given room so I haven't tried creating groups yet - however I will be trying this as soon as other devices are installed.\n\n**** 8/29 update - I created a scene in my insteon app today, to group several fixtures together (as a start three bulbs and one plugin dimmer). While I was able to turn this scene on/off from my PC- I wasn't able to control this insteon scene from Alexa - I had to create a group for the same units directly in alexa's app instead. << just a little tip for ya :)"}

Yes, just like getting a new computer, you will have to reload programs (and all the music you pirated using Napster). This is, after all, a new head unit for a relatively high tech system of systems. All that aside, it works like a champ. I have about 20 or so Insteon devices, installed them all myself. All of them linked quickly with no hiccups. As far as functionality with my Amazon Echo, it works great. I tell her to turn on or off something or set something to a certain percentage and she says, \"okay.\" No issues. You will have to add the Alexa skill to your Echo and create some groups using the skill software so that she can recognize what device or group of devices you want her to control. But, if you have one you are probably already familiar with that process. It's painless. Insteon was my first foray into home automation. My system has been working flawlessly for over three years. I've been using this new hub for a couple months now with no issues. It took me less than 30 minutes to go from box, to linking devices, to back to my lounge chair. I have not been disappointed."}

Any of the other HUB-based products will likely serve you better, particularly if you're looking to integrate with some of the more popular services like IFTTT. This is because Insteon's HUB software is terrible and rather glitchy for anything but the most mundane tasks, and Insteon is a closed system that really doesn't play too well with other brands. I had purchased this because I had invested in a large number of Insteon devices years ago (back in 2007), and spent a lot of time getting everything programmed, etc., and I didn't want to replace almost 50 devices.\n\nAnd even then, I regret my decision to purchase because the Insteon Hub software doesn't recognize any existing programming, whether done through the Insteon HouseLinc software or manually through the devices themselves. In fact, the Harmony software will likely glitch and not work if you try to create scenes when you have existing programming on your devices. After speaking with Insteon support about this (they were friendly and tried to be as helpful as they could, given the limitations of the Insteon hard/software), their suggestions to me: do a factory reset of all my devices and reprogram them using the Insteon Hub software (again, which is terrible) or buy an ISY994i and try to read the existing programming and \"clean up\" any glitches the Insteon Hub software may have introduced (and this may not even work, they warned, and you'd still have to do a factory reset).\n\nI had considered the ISY994i, but opted for the Insteon Hub because it was \"natively\" supported by the Harmony (Elite) Hub and the Amazon Echo/Alexa. Don't be fooled; the integration isn't as smooth as what you'd imagine. For example, the Harmony will allow turning \"ON\" Insteon scenes through the activity screen, but there's no way to turn them OFF unless you assign the scene to a hard button. At the time of my purchase, the Echo didn't support ISY but apparently it does now. And if you're looking for deeper automation via IFTTT, Insteon isn't directly supported so you'll either need to use recipes through other devices, such as through Harmony Activities, or pay a third party a monthly fee to integrate a limited number of individual devices. This may be OK if you only have a few devices, but if you've got a whole-house set-up, you'll need some disposable income. To this end, I'm trying to learn about Insteon's API to see if I can create my own IFTTT-Insteon because I'd really hate to see my large Insteon investment go to waste, but apparently Insteon isn't granting many API keys these days, so this could just be a pipe dream.\n\nAs a final note, do NOT attach any security-related devices to the Insteon Hub. Hub communications are handled as clear text."}

If you're paying someone to install these for you, that really sucks.\n\nSoftware:\nTheir software is incomprehensible to me, which is sad given that I work in technology and some degree of actual programming experience. The switches seem to lose their programming randomly and need to be reprogrammed. This can easily take 2-3 hours for my home with ~18 switches as the switches must not only be programmed to work with each other, but also the Insteon Hub app on your phone. I usually have to do this 1-2 times a year.

First, it does NOT use your home's Wi Fi network to reach other units to be controlled but creates its own and the range of that network is very limited. The hub could not detect one of the plug-in controllers in the other end of our house and I'm now reduced to buying a range extender to reach something on the same floor of the same dwelling. Second, the Quick Start guide tells us to not plug the hub into a power strip and I ignored those instructions. The hub would not work until it was plugged directly into an outlet I guess because the system ostensibly uses home wiring to reach other controllers. (See the comment after \"First\" to note how well THAT works.) Finally, I agree with other customers who have complained about the documentation that goes with this product. The setup is NOT well explained nor is it as intuitive as the product designers seem to think. And getting the interface with the Amazon Echo to work consistently has not yet succeeded. I'm not a tech idiot and rarely have the setup difficulties with other products that I have experienced with this one.

No, not by any means. There is still no sensor support of any kind, there is no web app, the iPad apps have layout issues and dozens and dozens of other small quibbles.

{"Author": "Gina D.", "Date": "on April 21, 2016", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "The programming of different devices is too limited.", "Text": "I received this as a gift, as I had an idea for a \"programmable timer\" that could be set-up by an app in your phone, but Quirky went out of business before I could submit it. I told a friend about my idea, and he remarked, \"it's already been invented,\" and so he gifted this to me. The system is \"close\" to my invention, but lacks what my idea has, flexibility.\n\nThe system comes with a controller, plus two dimmer modules. The controller has to be plugged into a wall outlet (no power strip) and into your internet router (it comes with a Ethernet cable) so you can communicate to the controller via Wi-Fi, and remotely. The modules communicate to the controller, I assume, through the wiring in your wall. Install their app to your phone from your phone's app store. Launch the app, pick \"Add a Device\", plug-in a module, and press the button on the side, so the app can discover it. Easy enough.\n\nNow the problem; everything I wished to control is either an LED or fluorescent lamp. Dimmer modules do not play well with those two lamp types. When \"off,\" my LED lamps would just dim, and my fluorescent lamp would flicker. So, my next thought was to use them on \"something\" that would not react like this, but these modules are only capable of handling 300-watts (2.5-amps)! They're best suited for something I no longer use; incandescent lamps. I ended up tossing the modules in a drawer.\n\nUndaunted, and due to a Amazon Gift card, I thought I'd give this thing another chance so I purchased the basic plug-in On-Off module, and an On-Off wall switch. These two modules were great, as they were rated for 1800-watts (15-amps). The plug-in module went to control the fluorescent lamp of my aquarium, while the wall switch went to operate the porch and walk-way lights. Adding them to the app was easy, as explained before. Now the next problem; flexibility! Insteon's interface programmer, apparently, never heard of it.\n\nAs mentioned, I am controlling an aquarium lamp, and a porch light. I'd like to have them both come on a dusk, but the aquarium turn-off at Midnight, while the porch light turn-off a dawn; cannot be done! The app does not allow two \"schedules\" sharing the same \"on or \"off\" time. seems rather ridiculous and an unnecessary limit.\n\nNow, you can have two or more devices share the same schedule, and this is done through creating \"scenes,\" which are nothing more than an \"on-off\" time that allow multiple devices.\n\nTo be fair, I suppose I'm not Insteon's target customer. I think it would be better to receive the basic \"on-off\" module than the dimmers, but I suppose it's the only way Insteon can get rid of them, since most people I know no longer use incandescent bulbs. I suppose it's a plus for Insteon making additional money selling the modules one can really use.\n\nMy conclusion is this system is just OK. I wouldn't buy one if what you're looking to do is what I use it for. The inflexibility of the programming interface is very disappointing. One should be able to intermix multiple devices to share on-off times.\n\nSave your money, go to Harbor Freight, and buy regular dial timers."}

Now I can just say, \"Alexa, turn on the bug zapper\" and she will turn on the fly execution device in the greenhouse, or, \"Alexa, dim the kitchen lights to 50%\" and it will happen.\nOK, so that's the good part. The bad part is the thoroughly frustrating software app that INSTEON provides for use with or without Alexa. In concept it is great. I should be able to set schedules for various lights and outlets or even special thermostats. I should be able to tell it to turn specific lights or groups of lights at sunset and off at a particular time, or at sunrise. So far and after much email conversations with their support, I can do some of it fine and others not at all.\nWhen INSTEON (note that they are capitalizing their name each time, not me) gets it right, I will be able to just say \"Alexa, always turn on the living room ceiling lights at 20 minutes after sunset, except on Thursdays\" and she will take it from there. INSTEON has finally figured out when sunset is each day of the year by my geographic location so that part is covered."}

I find the insteon hub ok for controlling a simple network but lacking in features needed for home automation.\n\nYou manage the hub and define & control devices connected to insteon modules in your home from an app installed on your phone. You can set up simple schedules to turn devices on/off by time of day or sunrise/sunset. You can read the status of insteon sensors in the home on demand, and it's supposed to be able to send you an email from \"the cloud\" when sensor status changes, but there's no way to set \"rules\" or \"events\" to instruct the hub to do something on its own when, for instance, the leak sensor detects water. The phone app is a little clunky but I would hope this will improve. It's almost like they added additional screens just to make it look more full-featured than it is: Finding where to change the name of a device after it was added was a real challenge. The variety of devices you can add seems limited also. Smoke detectors, door locks, and unique items like the SynchroLinc seem to be conspicuously absent from the Add Device list.\n\nOther posts are correct: For those of you who have existing devices you need to add them to the hub from scratch. This though, according to Smarthome, is a security feature of insteon, not a failure of the hub, and was intended to prevent someone from driving up to your driveway and getting control over your home: There is apparently no way to \"scan\" an insteon network to find/add your devices... you have to link/pair each item manually."}

I've replaced the few X10 devices I already had in place and added more Insteon switches. Perhaps things have improved since some of the earlier reviews, but overall my experience has been very positive. After a few weeks, I've only seen a couple of small glitches that I can't account for and those were with adding complicated scenes and certainly weren't show stoppers.\n\nTo one reviewer's complaint about having to manually add devices, this is still true at first. You have to go touch each device the first time. To be fair, there's really no other good way to do this. The hub detects the device and gives you a chance to name it and assign it to a room. When adding devices to scenes, the hub automatically added all my wired in / plugged in devices without having to touch them again. Battery powered devices such as leak sensors and open/close sensors do require manually pressing the set button to add / change scenes.\n\nScenes and timers have worked well. Yes, there are some limitations but the hub and app will meet most people's needs. Others will need more complex PC / Mac software. Everything has been reliable so far.\n\nThe Amazon Echo integration, while it doesn't yet support scenes in full, really adds value. It's great to be able to easily control lights by voice."}

After moving it to several other ports it finally did. From there downloading the application and connecting to controllers was fairly easy.\n\nNow comes the frustrating part. The software that comes with the unit is totally lacking in any useful documentation. The \"quick start guide\" is very good in explaining how to set up and configure the hub and modules but when it comes to the nuances of the software app, zilch, bupkis, nada! For example after setting up dimmer module and then testing the light connected to it turns on and off one can set a \"on level\". You\u2019d think that once that \"on level\" was set it would be remembered the next time the light was turned on. Think again, it isn\u2019t. One has to create a scene, add then add a device to that scene and then set that level.\n\nAfter adding a device to scene and accessing \"scene members\" there are 3 configuration dots that allow one to edit or delete the item. If you choose the edit button there is a blue and red (color may be different on your phone or app), box. The blue box has the option for \"responder, controller or both\". No where in any documentation could I find anything to indicate what the different options are. Accessing the green option allows one to set a permanent \"on rate\" and \"ramp\" rate. Again there isn't any documentation on what a \"ramp rate\" is either.\n\nThe above is just one example of the many documentation deficiencies. I consider myself proficient with technology. However, even I was very challenged in getting Insteon to function the way I want it to function.\n\nGiven the above I\u2019m sure many users might decide to totally give up on configuring their system. Take heart, this is one company that has excellent customer support. The wait times to speak to a specialist can be lengthy but they do have a \"call back\" feature that allows you to enter your name, phone number and a brief description of your problem and they will call you back. The specialists are very patient and understanding.\n\nAs indicated above I am very comfortable with technology and have the \"Amazon Echo\". After configuring the \"connected home\" option it is possible to control Insteon using voice commands without having to use the Insteon app at all."}

{"Author": "Pilchard", "Date": "on February 9, 2016", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "My review of the Smarthome Insteon Hub has some good news and some bad", "Text": "This is a good news, bad news product. It may be 5 stars if you fit what it can do, or 1 star if you can't. The Insteon Hub 2 as depicted is the newer Insteon hub model, the older model had a small web server. There seems no easy way to access any local web server feature on this device. It connects via Ethernet cable to my local network. There are apps to support this on Microsoft Windows 8 and 10 (in the app store), Apple OS and Google Android operating systems. My personal experience is with Android and Windows 10, for me there is no Apple device in my home.\n\nThe app presents pre-defined icons fitted on a graphical screen. Words to describe and or label devices. Adding a device to the Insteon hub is easy, just enter the type of device, and decide if you want to connect to it by ID or by pushing a button on the device to activate. Either way adding devices is easy. It's up to you to create your home name, room names, scene names, and device names.\n\nFor me it was easiest to start with my home, just give it a name like home and it's good. Similarly rooms are more or less free style. They get alphabetized in a folder called rooms. Scenes are also easily named, but usually require a device.\n\nDevice control takes time, even if you are using a cell phone attached to your local Wi-Fi. Control also works over Internet (you can be away from home and use cellular data to control devices in your home).\n\nThere is an Insteon Hub app in the Microsoft Windows 8 and 10 app store (for desktop / laptop users). It is very similar to the Android app, though it seems a bit bugged as I write this review. First there is an error message on launch that push notifications couldn't be established. This is fine, but it comes up as a notification on each launch. It would be nice to not have it.\n\nRegarding support, it's not good. My Fanlinc devices (which control overhead fans) work well on the Android app, but on the Windows 10 app version only light is available. The Insteon Hub interface for Alexa seems unable to operate anything but a fan light when using a Fanlinc module. This makes it impossible to control the fan blades (paddles?). Customer service isn't of much help.They wanted to remotely access my computer, when denied, their suggestion was to uninstall and reinstall the Windows app (didn't work).\n\nIntegration with the Amazon Echo is also a bit messed up. Echo reads devices, but not scenes. The result is she doesn't understand that a room may have a number of lights, but a scene may set different groups of lights. This can be overcome by duplicating the scene into the Echo app on a smart phone and adding something called a group. A group is like a scene, but is stored on the Amazon Echo, and will drive each device in the scene from the Echo. There is no way to automatically relate Amazon Echo Groups with Smarthome Insteon Hub scenes. This is a failure of Amazon and Smarthome to get along, my guess is this won't be resolved. Smarthome is busy with the recently launched Hub Pro which only works with Apple products.\n\nThere is an older version of software to control an Insteon network, it seems designed for Windows 7 and is text centric (not icon centric). This version of the Insteon Hub software does work under Windows 10, though device support is an issue. Smarthome has released support for newer devices, but it isn't automatically updated as the Windows 7 app seems no longer supported. After determining where the update files were to support my Fanlinc, I restarted the app and have had no issue controlling fanlinc devices from this app. Though the app won't sync with the Insteon Hub, so you'll have to reproduce everything. Tech support from Smarthome indicated the Microsoft app store was the only Insteon Hub control product for Windows 8 and 10, that the Windows 7 Houselinc 2 would not run under Windows 10. This is not true. Of the few calls made to Smarthome, never was any good advice offered or a solution found to any issue. The Windows 10 app does have one feature the Windows 7 lacks, the Smarthome Windows app 10 controls my microphone.\n\nCurrently there are 31 Insteon devices on my network, and 3 X10 devices. X10 support isn't very good on the newer interfaces and it is going, but there seems unnecessary difficulty getting X10 to work well. Others have reported very small limits to the number of Insteon devices, so far, my 31 devices all work and are controlled by the local Insteon Hub without issue.\n\nThe good news / bad news is as follows, if you use an Android App, good news, you'll like the Insteon Hub, if you use Windows 7, you may not like it much as you'll need to fiddle with device set up and synchronization for changes made by other apps doesn't work. If you use Windows 8 or 10 and install the Smart Hub app from the Microsoft Store, well it will work, but has some gliches, like broken fanlinc support or nuisance notifications that reflect a broken signaling interface that can't be turned off.\n\nFor me at this time, the Insteon Hub is a crossover device. Eventually I'll be using Homeseer. I wish Smarthome was working better to help with the interfaces on Windows. For basic scene management this is a decent device, for larger homes, or more complex situations (with triggers and what not) a more advanced controller is necessary.\n\nThe Insteon Hub does not support triggers or events. There is limited support for a timer (a scene or device can be turned off at a specific time or sunrise / sunset). However only one device or scene can use the same time (this means if want multiple devices turned on at sunset a scene will have to be built as only one sunset timer is permitted). Interaction with the Amazon Echo is not always accurate, often the Echo will report it turned on or off a device, but the device failed to perform the function. The supposed Insteon feedback to be certain a signal gets to its destination fails in this pairing. It isn't clear to me if the failure is at Amazon or Smarthome, but a highly likely guess is Smarthome.\n\nRecently at a hacker conference, the Insteon network was hacked using wireless. Apparently there is some use of xor and a crc to try and prevent seeing clear signals, but this is easily defeated. A $60 Raspberry Pi like device with 915Mhz capable wireless interface can spy on and control an Insteon network, with good antennas at some distance. The hackers indicated Insteon has a command to turn off RF for all it's devices, but only companies that sign a non-disclosure agreement have access to this.\n\nThus our Insteon networks are not secure, and are quite hackable. We may use these for lights and what not, but maybe not for door locks.\n\nSigh."}

It took 40 minutes to undo the sunset/sunrise scene, 30 minutes to do a sunset scene and 20 minutes to create a sunrise scene.\n\nThe biggest disappoint was the iPhone app. It takes two minutes to initialize and the information is useless.

Compounding its inherent design flaws is its unreliability and bugginess. If you are looking for a well designed and stable automation hub for Insteon, look no further than Universal Devices ISY94 series. Although somewhat more complicated than Insteon's version, it isn't hampered by its design limitations or erratic behavior. For example, one is not inexplicably limited to having only one device scheduled for dusk and dawn operation. As an added bonus, the ISY devices can be upgraded to support Z-Wave and Zigbee wireless protocols in addition to IP communication, providing for near \"Universal\" interoperability in environments containing any of these device types. This is of particular importance for those wishing to include devices such as locksets which do not have an Insteon equivalent. UDI's technical support, while not instantaneous, is exceptional. Not only do they know their product inside and out, the also know Insteon products as well. Check them out."}

The App for Windows is buggy and lacks features. It does not seem to get updated often and is ignored. I purchased this hub in the first few weeks it came out (over a year ago) as of today the web interface still says Beta and doesn't do much. The Android app is clumsy and convoluted and most importantly it is not designed for a tablet and will not rotate to landscape mode which makes using it on a tablet terrible.\n\nIf the hub is offline you cannot login to any app or the web page to administer anything. My hub died a little after 1 year and I had to get it replaced. There is no apparent way for you to replace your own hub without calling and sitting on hold for 40+ minutes. Then they have to delete your account and cannot just re-assign your hub to that account. You are better off just using a new email address and setting everything up again.\n\nI have used insteon for years but this product just makes me wish I had gone Z-Wave... There is no advanced features and overall it is just really hard to use.\n\nOn the bright side... The Logitech Harmony Hub has really nice integration with the insteon hub. This allows you to use your insteon devices from the Logitech remote or app. This integration is the only reason this device gets 2 stars. The logitech app is WAY better and hides some the utter lack of features.\n\nI have not tried Insteon Cameras but I can only imagine how horrible it would be to use this app on a tablet. The resolution of the camera would be squished up or you would have to rotate it one way to view and the other to use...(this is speculation)\n\nI am also REALLY bothered by Insteons hub apparent strategy. They made a 2nd Hub Pro that only works with Apple and I have heard they are making another hub that is \"Internet of Things\" compatible instead of making one nice hub that works across all platforms. There seems to be a real lack of consistent effort and strategy on insteons part.\n\nTo sum up this review - this hub is FRUSTRATING\n\nAs I write this review I have just had my 3rd Dimmer in 12 months go south so I have to call Insteon (Smarthome) again.\n\nOn the positive side - Once you finally get to someone the support people are VERY helpful and SUPER willing to replace and/or support the product. Kudos to whomever runs that support department because I have ALWAYS had a great customer service experience with them."}

I installed them yesterday and couldn't be happier. The installation, setup and configuration was straightforward and simple. No connectivity issues whatsoever. Linking them to my Amazon Echo was a walk in the park. Since the Insteon app knows where the hub is physically located in the world, it is able to recognize time zones, daylight savings time and the sunrise and sunset on a particular day. Consequently, setting up a scene that turns the lights on and off at sunset and sunrise was also very easy. In summary, the products work as advertised and I would definitely recommend them.\n\nOne note of caution, if you want to link an Insteon hub to your Amazon Echo you must purchase this specific model of the hub as it is the only one currently supported by Amazon Echo."}

Once setup, the clarity of picture is amazing.\n\nOne thing to look out for, if you have a device (like garage door opener / plugin) that is not RF and only powerline, then adding an outlet or switch that is both can help with connectivity issues. In my case, the device was right next to the hub, but couldn't reach it because it was powerline only and was on an electrical sub panel. By adding a light switch in the garage everything worked perfectly. It really is true what the instructions say, the more devices you add, the better Insteon works as it will use both RF and powerline to make a mesh of a network across your home.\n\nI just started working with the REST API. The web site API instructions are very good. I didn't notice at first, but they actually show working code examples in 14 languages like PHP, VB, Ruby, Java, etc. I tried Javascript first (AJAX call from a page running on Apache), but the Insteon site rejected my connection (doesn't allow calls from another domain).

It came as part of a startup package that was sold at Costco. Upon first connecting it, the hub updated itself to the latest software version (you will need a smartphone - I have an iPhone 6S). Then I place the two lamp modules were I wanted them and went through the discover protocol and they connected just like that. Couldn't have been easier. Since that went so well, I ordered an Insteon LED light for my outdoor garage light fixture. The bulb came and worked as advertised. Haven't had any issues with any of the components. I have had a X-10 system for many years (seems like at least 20 years), so am used to how that system functions and bought Insteon to start phasing our my many X-10 devices.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that multiple scenes can't use any of the same times used in another scene (or device). For instance, I have my main floor indoor lights come on at sunset and go off at 11 PM (yes I can get over not having the flexibility of X-10 plus and minus sunset times). But I want to have my garage outdoor light come on at sunset also and go off at sunrise. But the system won't let me do that since sunset has already been used in another scene. This is a mind boggling shortcoming that needs to get fixed. I had to just pick a time for the outdoor light to come on and will have to adjust that time manually as the seasons change.\n\nHave read many of the reviews on this site and haven't had any of the problems or failures mentioned in some reviews. I am pleased and will keep adding incrementally to the system.INSTEON 2245-222 Central Controller Hub"}

This has been a downhill spiral, and every time a new method of controlling them comes out, I have this irrational optimism that this time Smarthome will have figured it out.\n\nNope.\n\nThis hub is the latest in a series of increasingly serious disappointments. It claims to be Insteon compatible, but it turns out that it is only compatible with a secret list of Insteon devices. Some of my devices are on the list, some aren't. You might wish to call technical support for clarification or help, but be prepared for 1.5 hours of waiting on hold to get through.\n\nThe central problem with this device is that even if everything worked as the app says it should (and it flat out does not), it still is terrible. You can set a scene up, but if anything goes wrong during the setup, you're left with a huge mess. The individual Insteon devices each keep a database of what they're supposed to do, and the links in each database have to be synchronized with the other devices (controllers and responders) for everything to work well. Apparently nobody told the Smarthome software designers this, as they don't have any way to deal with broken links, which happen for lots of real-world reasons, including that they just have flaky programming from this flaky hub.\n\nIf you have more than two devices or two scenes, this spirals completely out of control. Quickly nothing responds correctly and you're running around the house poking all the light switches *for hours* doing this \"manual linking\" thing that should not be required in the first place.\n\nSmarthome has demonstrated repeatedly that they are perfectly happy leaving their customers high and dry without firmware updates or support for things we've wired into our houses.\n\nAs a pretty good expert on Insteon, I say STAY AWAY!"}

The hub will not act as a modem. It does not support X10. It does not have support for HouseLinc and other software products that Smarthome has put out previously.\n\nIn addition it's \"cloud based\" which means that a network connection must be available for it to work. The web interface looked poor and behaved badly - I tried adding a device by ID number (since it's part of a MicroLinc which is installed inside a lamp and there is no access to the 'set' button). The device was communicated with and added, but uncontrollable.\n\nLooks like I have to find a new way to program my Insteon switches... or get rid of them altogether.

Primary use is security lighting and home status monitoring.\n\nPluses:\n-The hardware is well made, looks plenty solid.\n-The whole system actually works pretty well. I can see the status of my various lights and sensors, and (after I removed a signal booster) the older X10 receiver modules still work.\nA leak or a door opening can send an alert in a second or so, and can also send an email message.\n-Adding new modules is fairly painless, select it from the app add device screen, a button press on the module, a few beeps from the hub and you're done!\n\nMinuses:\n- The software is still pretty primitive. The UX in general feels like as Beta 1 version (ie only the minimum must have main features implemented) not a shipping product.\n1) Only one schedule can be made with dusk dawn, and no random option to simulate \"human activity.\n2) X10 modules can't be part of any scenes\n3) There's no conditionals, like \"If the front door is opened between 8PM and 6 AM, send an alert\".\n4) The applet drops the connection when I go offsite and won't reconnect when I return, I have to exit and restart the applet.\n5) I expected to be able to easily manage controllers, responders, and their links. It appears you can only manage these by scenes and it doesn't seem to import existing links.\n6) I also expected to be able to manage mapping controllers to older X10 modules, this feature seems to be entirely missing.\n\nSince the minuses appear to be all software issues, hopefully the Insteon team will be addressing them via a software update soon."}
{"Author": "M. Cruzan", "Date": "on October 3, 2015", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Updated: The Insteon Hub does not work with Echo/Alexa", "Text": "Whether this device will work right off will depend on what you use to control it with. So far I have had the best luck using the app for Android. It seems to be updated with more features and has functioned nearly flawlessly. I suspect the IOS app is similar but I have not tried it. At the time I am writing this review the desktop Windows app does not work well at all and it is not updated. The Windows phone app works fine, but does not have all the features that the android apps has. I expect they will get around to updating the windows apps eventually.\n\nBasic functions for controlling dimmer switches works fine from all the apps I have tried. Finding and linking devices works well from the Android and Windows phone apps, but not from the desktop. Scenes only seem to work from the Android app. Scene assignments include adding functions to Insteon keypads. This works fine from the Android app.\n\nOnce the hub is set up the Amazon Echo - Alexa - will integrate with it quickly and easily. Alexa can control physical devices but she cannot currently control scenes, so that means anything controlled by individual keypad buttons. The Alexa app does have the ability to assign devices to groups, but this is limited to the devices she can recognize. Depending on how complete your home automation system is, this can be very limiting. For example, I can tell Alexa to turn on a light or a set of lights, but she cannot control my AV system (at present). The group feature also does not have the flexibility of control over ramp levels and speeds the way that Insteon scenes do. Currently the Insteon Hub is not very good about taking advantage of all the features that Insteon devices offer.\n\nJust in the last few days the Android App was upgraded to add and control X10 devices. This is a power line protocol that dates back to the 1950's and is still widely used. Many Insteon devices are compatible with X10 so this addition really expands the flexibility of the hub. Currently Alexa is not able to control X10 devices - she can discover them, but then there is an message saying that she cannot control them.\n\nI'm giving this hub four stars because it has a long ways to go to become fully functional, but it is also clear that they are actively working to update the apps and add features. I should also mention that the schedule programming in this hub is very limited - on/off at certain times of day and that is all. If you want full program flexibility there are much better options out there. I have had a lot of luck with the JDS HomeRunner RBI. The main reason to get this hub is to allow control over your automation system using the Amazon Echo.\n\nUpdate March 2016: Not integrated with the Amszon Echo. The Echo developers have done only the minimum effort here - it will control individual devices, but it will not activate scenes (groups within the Insteon hub). For example, this makes all the Insteon keypad devices worthless - Alexa cannot do anything with all those buttons. After many complaints over many months they keep saying this is \"high priority\" but we have waited a very long time. I am really fed up."}

The app needed some work but things just worked together once I got it setup. Even my wife, who is not tech-savvy, loves the app and controls our lights and fans using the Insteon app. When I read about Apple's release of HomeKit, I was hoping that Insteon would work with Apple to get everything working seamlessly. I purchased the Insteon Hub Pro and it was not sent out until the HomeKit release from Apple. I have been doing construction on my home and finally got around to installing the new Hub Pro. Unfortunately, nothing really works with the Hub Pro. I have 10 open/close sensors, 1 garage opener, 3 fanlincs/keypadlincs, 9 switches and 1 water sensor. That's plenty of money spent on Insteon products but none of my existing products work with the new Hub Pro according to Insteon because it needs Apple to support the devices. That's fine and I understand that Apple does things their way so there may be some pain along the way. After being a loyal Insteon customer for this long and spending a significant amount of money to outfit my house, I was hoping I could get my money back from Insteon since the Hub Pro does not do what it's advertised to do which is work with Insteon products. It doesn't make any sense why there is no warning/disclaimer that says \"if you are an existing Insteon customer, don't buy the Hub Pro because nothing will work.\" I just want a full refund for my purchase of a device that doesn't work for me but Insteon refuses to do so and only allows me to return if for store credit. I don't need any more sensors or cameras or anything else so store credit does me no good. Real bummer Insteon. I have always recommended your products to others but not sure I can continue to do so after being treated this way. Guess my Hub Pro will just collect dust in the box."}

The hub and/or its apps are so flawed that it will be impossible to set up anything complex. I used both the Windows 10 PC app and the Android app in an attempt to set up a 60+ device home with 6 8-key pads. If there is a single communication error with any of the keypads during setup, it will completely hose up the scenes for all of the other devices. It will be so bad that you will have to do a factory reset on every device, delete the account in the cloud and start from scratch. After days of going through this cycle, I gave my device away (properly warning the victim, of course).\n\nThere is no error recovery, no backup and restore mode, and other flaws aplenty.\n\nWhile it's pretty nice to use your smart phone to control devices in your home, that thrill is completely negated by the failure to perform anything remotely complex. It will also consume your smartphone's battery. I was only able to set up about 1/2 of my house with a single charge on a phone that I normally recharge every 48 hours. I suppose you could plug it in while doing this, but you will be exhausted by that point anyway.\n\nI now have a Universal Devices ISY994i which is handling my home just fine.

Instead, you'll be entering and pairing EVERY device you have all over again. If you have a lot of Insteon, as I do, it's just too much. Especially because the software is very broken; you receive Access Denied messages, Comin Soon messages, and blatant bugs. The worst is in the device add, where even the text box for the name has several bugs. Voice recognition doesn't even work properly in their text box, so you'll be typing the name of every device as well.\n\nEntering, linking, and naming each device takes 1-2 minutes, so it's only about an hour for 30 devices, but it's a painful process.\n\nThen, when you create scenes, you get to do it all over again! For each device you add to a scene, run around the house in whatever order it tells you and press the link button manually on every device? That one in the basement crawl space for the circulation pump? Get on your coveralls, you're going down there.\n\nThe web interface is undocumented, labelled as \"BETA\", and doesn't allow you do add/edit/change anything. You cannot add or edit or rename devices in the web interface, which would have at least given you a keyboard way of entering all of this information. Perhaps you can bind a full size bluetooth keyboard to a phone - had not tried that.\n\nThis would have been an AMAZING product if it could have just imported everything from the devices and given me mobile phone control of it. Unfortunately just configuring it is a hobby on its own.\n\nThe integration with the Echo is well done - the Echo just does it's thing and finds everything, but only the devices you've re-entered into the hub. It doesn't work for being \"close\" - it will fail to recognize \"Turn on the Bathroom Tub\" as \"Turn on the Bathroom Rub\", and fail. It should likely have some heuristics to get the \"closest\" sounding device, particularly since you preface every command with \"Turn on\" or \"Turn off\".\n\nCompared to desktop software solutions like Indigo (which is what I've used for years even though it requires a Mac I have no other use for) this is amateurish and rushed to market. Wait six months and see where they're at.\n\nIf, however, you are setting up a brand new Insteon installation of a handful of security lights and so on, this is likely adequate if you work around the frustrations. For a larger pre-existing setup, I will use mine only for the 10 or so devices I -really- want the Echo in control of."}

I had a little difficulty finding the hub from my Insteon App, but realized that there must be a timeout between powering up the hub and searching for a hub on the app...so be sure to start the app shortly after powering up the hub. Once I did this setup was a breeze! The product works exactly as I expected. I would like to see a little more functionality, but expect that this will be part of App upgrades thoughout the years.\n\nOne note for the Insteon makers would be to put the plug on the side of the dimmer modules instead of the bottom. My plug receptacles are too close to my baseboard hydronic heat to make these units usable in those locations...I need to turn my wall receptacles upside down in order to plug a lamp into these modules because of this. If the plug was on the side of the dimmer module this would resolve the problem."}
