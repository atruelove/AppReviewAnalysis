Tiles connected fine with bluetooth and location enabled. As soon as I turned off location services the tiles were useless. I specifically confirmed these tiles worked with bluetooth capability only and was told they would. Well the FACTUAL information is these will work with bluetooth 4.0 devices but not the new 5.0 on the s9."}

From the beginning it would not ring an iPhone 6 or an iPhone SE unless the Tile App was showing on the screen. We are using iOS 11.4.1 and the latest Tile App from the App Store. It also did not work on the iPhone 6 when it had the last iOS 10 installed. The Tile will ring either phone correctly when the Tile App is showing, and the \u201cFind your Keys\u201d function works OK. The Tile URL will also ring the correct phone. Tile Customer Service has had me try many different things via emails since July 26th, and even sent a replacement newer Tile, but the system still has the same problem. They have given up as of today. If anyone has found a solution to this problem, I\u2019d appreciate a response. Since you are probably not going to have the Tile App showing when you lose your phone, essentially the major function is not working for us. It is a nice concept, but for now the system only rates 1 star."}

It has a very short range and does not perform when you need it. Unreliable and has a very short battery life. This is a good idea in theory, but the final product does not delivery. It was really designed to maximize profits for the company and not provide a long-lasting and reliable product to the consumer."}

Loves it!!!", "Text": "I received a Tile as a gift from a friend who had extras. I'm not a forgetful person but I've lost my keys a couple times the past year so it's definitely helped me. It helped me find my keys those couple times so I figured I buy a Tile for my girlfriend who loses her keys and/or her phone A LOT (3-4 times a week). I can't count how many times she's asked me, \"Have you seen my keys or phone?\" Now that she has the Tile, she finds whichever she has at hand and uses it then BOOM! She finds it.\n\nThe only drawbacks I can think of are the battery life on it and the bluetooth. I wish the battery life was longer and indicate how much battery is left on the Tile app. As for the bluetooth, the phone has to have bluetooth on at all times to stay connected to the tile. If you turn it off then turn it back on, it reconnects half the time but sometimes it doesn't and you're SOL if you lost your belongings attached to the Tile."}

IF located on app, the app shows you it's in the stadium. Good luck.\n\nExample #2: Cat run away from home? Tile shows you the last known location - at home. Start printing missing cat fliers.\n\nExample #3: Misplaced keys at home? Using app search for keys...app shows keys at home... Listening for chime... Few days later, in the car on driveway.\n\nExample #4 (Best results): Misplaced keys at home. Using app to locate... I hear the chime! Ah it's in my pocket, silly me.\n\nI give it 2 stars b/c if you are kind of a messy person and often misplace your phone or keys (in your room or small house) it works great but also note that it won't locate your phone if the phone's Bluetooth is off.\n\nSummary: Tile is a gimmick. It's a simple Bluetooth MIDI advertised as a tracking device. I almost want to give it 1 star after saying that."}

From someone who looses everything this has been a life saver. I have had my tiles for a little over a year now. I have one on all of my keys and one in my wallet. It is zero stress whenever I lose something I just grab my phone (which I hopefully haven\u2019t lost) and hit find. If for some reason I lost my phone then I just grab something with a tile, hit the button twice, and I can find my phone. It was very easy to set up, took less than 10 minuets. It also isn\u2019t too bulky to have on my keychain. It\u2019s almost like another key. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s too big to keep in my pocket or anything. I use it to find my car in parking garages, my boyfriend in crowds, and I have put it on my cat (would not recommend) for easy finding. A small downside, if you aren\u2019t close enough to your item then your phone won\u2019t connect to it. Luckily your phone keeps track of the last location it was connected so you can just go straight to that point and it will connect. Overall a would recommend this to anyone. It it a comfort knowing that even when I lose my keys they aren\u2019t really lost, just probably in the dirty clothes bin...again \ud83d\ude02"}

You spend hours hunting around the house for these things, all because a 4-year-old who shouldn't have been messing with it in the first place was carrying it around and then got distracted by a shiny thing.\n\nNo more. NO. MORE.\n\nGet yourself a 4-pack of these tiles. Attach one to your keys, one to your tv remote, and the rest to whatever else disappears all the time (does your toddler have a toy he insists on bringing everywhere, and then promptly loses when you get there, forcing a 45 minute search of the grocery store for Mr Bun-bun? Give ole' Bun-Bun his own tile!). The load the app into your phone.\n\nNever. Lose. Your. Stuff. Again.\n\nLose your phone? Find any one of the tiles and activate it. BOOM, your phone sounds off, even if you had it set to silent.\n\nLose anything else? Pull out your phone, find the missing item listed in the Tile App, and activate it. Your keys are now screaming \"HERE I AM\" from underneath a sack of flour in the pantry. Because of course that's where they are. Most logical place, right?\n\nSeriously, this thing has saved me so much time in the few months since I bought it, I feel like I'm on vacation all the time. I don't have to spend all day trying to find something before I can make a 5-minute run to the store. Once I get to the store to buy the one thing I needed for dinner, I don't need to spend an hour backtracking all over the store, dreading that this will be the time some other kid has picked up a lost Mr Bun-Bun and so he's now gone forever.\n\nI love this product so much, I would gladly offer sexual favors to it's inventor. Daily. After all, I have the free time now."}

It is so accurate on his location also and it shows me the path he took to get to where he is at that moment. At night is when he escapes so he camouflages pretty well in the dark but when I\u2019m tracking him there is a flashing blue light which helps and I also use my phone flashlight and I\u2019m able to see his eyes If he is hiding in a bush. I honestly don\u2019t care about paying the 12-14 fee I don\u2019t know exactly how much it is. I\u2019m paranoid about someone stealing my cat or him getting by a car. This gives me peace of mind.

With four pack I could put one on keys, one in wallet, and one in each of me and my son's little med packs. The essentials if I'm in a hurry. Works good as long as you keep bluetooth on. I don't keep bluetooth on because it's a waste of battery most of the time. But no biggie because I can turn back on when I need to find something. The only problem is the feature that lets you double click the tile to find the phone. I didn't know it had that beautiful feature and its one of the other big reasons I got this one instead of others. But it doesn't always work. Of course then I can default to use \"find my phone app\" on iPad or whatever, but it's bummer that's not always possible. Also the speakers are very loud on the tiles unless they are complete unobstructed. So when its on something like keys the sound is clear and loud enough to find. For things like my wallet, where it is zipped inside, it's much tougher to track down the sound and I must silence the entire house to track it down."}

On the other hand I was easily able to ring some of the Tiles even when they were well out of sight; just depended on the Tile and location. I could have lived with these quirks but about a week ago one of the Tiles just stopped working; there was no low battery warning, it just died. I even tried to connect with a different phone to see if there was something wrong with my phone and it still didn't work even thought the other Tiles were fine. A couple days later another one died just like the first one; no warning, no reason, just dead. I bought the four pack at the beginning of June it is now the middle of August and only 2 of the 4 Tiles are still functioning. Since the batteries are not replaceable I don't even know if the battery died or if the Tiles were just faulty/not durable enough to be used with pets. If it is the durability it is something purely internal as the exterior only shows wear from ID tags rubbing against the Tile. I will likely replace these two with Tiles ordered DIRECTLY from Tile and see if they hold up better."}

After that you push the icon and the tile will ring.\nI then shared the tile to my phone hoping I could could use it to find the keys. I walked all over the house looking for them.

I like it so much I bought another for my husband and actually put it on his keychain. The original gift purchase is still going strong. The two subsequent purchases however have died. I feel like if you have unlimited funds and don't mind replacing them every 3 months it's great. If it had lasted one year I would have been fine. I'm on the fence about buying again for myself.

{"Author": "Mixed Signal Design", "Date": "on July 31, 2018", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Bluetooth connectivity issues", "Text": "This product has one flaw that I simply can't overlook. The bluetooth connection isn't reliable enough give you full confidence that you won't lose whatever your tile is attached to. When the tile mates lose bluetooth connection (ie too far away from your phone, or your phone is off, or bluetooth on your phone is off), the tile app marks the tile mate's last known location on a map. This is a pretty cool feature. The problem I've encountered (quite often) is that when the tile mates are back in bluetooth range (or you turn your phone/bluetooth back on) they don't reliably and consistently reconnect to bluetooth. And there's a good chance you won't know this has happened unless your checking your tile app to see if the tile mates have reconnected. When this happens, your tile app still thinks your tile mate is at that mapped location when bluetooth connection was lost. This can go on indefinitely until you discover the problem and correct the bluetooth connection. This usually requires you to toggle bluetooth on/off or sometimes power your phone on/off to get the tile mates to connect. I discovered this problem the hard way, when I couldn't find my keys in my house, and my tile app was telling me they were a place I'd been several days prior. In my opinion this issue greatly diminishes the value of this product. When the batteries die I won't replace unless I have confidence this problem is mitigated."}

The battery on one of the two Tile Mates that I ordered( at the same time), is dead and was only used 3 or 4 times. I attempted to \"re-Tile\" after receiving an email from Tile, offering a generous discount for replacing my units. After four attempts to make the purchase via the link provided in the email, I gave up because the order would never go through and their customer support is just an email address. Now, looking at the replacements on Amazon, it appears that the so-called discount for replacing them is about the same as the regular price on Amazon. If they had good customer support I would probably overlook the other shortcomings but I am thinking I can find another option that will have a replaceable battery and better volume."}

Usually I would find them on my own before the stupid app would even connect and then the two times I legitimately lost my keys, it wouldn't work. I ended up finding them through manually search. This product is a fantastic idea, but HORRIBLE EXECUTION. I cannot say enough bad things about this product. On the plus side, every time I bent down in my jean it would make my phone ring.

It helps me find my belongings very easily when I need to go out. However, tiles are connected to your phone via Bluetooth. The range of the tiles is impressive but it can only ring/send location when you are within 100 feet of where it is. Otherwise, it will give you it's LAST SEEN location if you are out of range. It will occasionally disconnect and you have to open the tile app on your phone in order for all the tiles to be reconnected again.\n\nWhen it comes to finding my phone with the tiles, my experience varies. When it is on mute, my phone will ring at maximum volume (or at least loud enough for me to hear from downstairs of my house). But when my phone is not on silence, the ringing is soft and I can barely hear it unless i am following the faint sounds and I am within a 5ft range."}

I would expect it to update about every minute. However, if I tell the app to let me know when it's seen, it doesn't take long to get an updated location.\n\nBottom line: It works, it's cheap, and it's easy to use"}

For example I left my keys in a jacket pocket that I rarely wear and hung it up in my closet. The bluetooth worked fine. However it was impossible to hear the sound until I finally searched the entire room and went through every jacket pocket. When I pulled the keys out of the pocket I could hear the tinny little sound. I have tried all combinations of the sounds offered. None of them work. Even if I lay the keys on the bed and throw a pair of jeans and a tshirt on top of the tile it is completely inaudible. Yes, my hearing is perfect. So. 2 stars because it lets you know they are \"somewhere\" around the proximity. A big F for finding them fast. In fact last night I was looking for them and Tile told me they were in my office.

For a while things were OK, but in the last 12 months or so, the reliability of these has been very poor. Now part of this has to do with the fact that these devices pair with your phone via Bluetooth - and bluetooth only works to about 30 feet. But even with that limitation in mind, like many other reviewers, I constantly get the \"phone is literally next to the Tile device, but the phone can't find it\" problem. This was NOT typical of older tiles. A more recent - and even worse - problem is that the Tile app finds the Tile tag, and claims it is playing a sound, and there's no sound at all coming out of the device. But - by far - the worst problem is the behavior where the app seems to in some kind of contact with the Tile tag, but there's a perpetually spinning circle as it is \"locating\" the tag - but it never makes the connection. The standard Tile support response can be boiled down to: \"Reboot your phone, and see what happens after a few minutes.\" Note that this does not actually solve the problem, but it does make you wonder why you spent $500 on a collection of Tile tags if they don't actually work most of the time.\n\nThe degradation in overall quality and customer experience is startling, as I was a big fan of these devices for a while, and I have a considerable investment in quite a few of the Tile tags. But now, as they gradually die off, I'm not replacing them. I'm just trying to be more careful with my stuff :)"}

Within two weeks of setting up 2 tiles, they stopped working. All of the troubleshooting advice hasn't helped. Cycling bluetooth, cycling phone, and trying to re-add the tiles only results in the spinning green circle.\n\nIf you're into troubleshooting tech then maybe you can keep these things working, but for the average user I'd stay far away. There's no way I'd recommend these to my parents for instance - just too much messing about to get it to work."}

Apparently needs \"reconnection\" every time you leave the range for the tile. Not worth any price!\n\nI have two barn cats, so I wanted to have a better way to see if they were in the barn when I shut the door at night. I received the Tile Mate today and activated it without any problem. I put it on the cat collar, checked the app, saw it was working, and went back inside. A short time later, I decided to check out the Tile. When I got to the barn, it said it was out of range...yet the cat was right at my feet with the Tile still on her collar. (Picture shows iPhone with message by cat/Tile.)\n\nChecking the Tile website, it says to make sure the app is updated (which it should be, considering I had just download it that day) and that problems may arise if you have it connected to multiple devices (which I did not). Another option was to turn bluetooth off and then back on (didn't work). A final suggestion was to turn off your phone for two minutes and then turn it back on. Finally, it worked. To see if it was a one-time thing, I went inside for a short time, and then back outside. Yet again, it said my Tile was out of range when the cat/Tile were right by my feet.\n\nThe entire time this was going on, I also had cat #2's Tile sitting on a shelf in the barn, waiting to go on that cat. It had the same problems, so I can eliminate the issue as a result of any damage done from cat #1 wearing her Tile.\n\n*Update: I did find that the Tile works with my iPad but not my iPhone. Range seems to be relatively low outside\u2014approximately 25 feet."}

In contacting Tile about the warranty, all I got a canned response about things to try so that's pretty useless. I'm not impressed with the durability, their privacy policy is, as other posters have pointed out, extremely invasive, and you have to be within bluetooth range to find what you lost. Yes, it does pinpoint the last location but that means having privacy policy set to always allow location, which means even more data for Tile to collect on me and sell to marketers and advertisers.

The only way this product can be better is to get the one with gps locating.

I bought both the wallet and key finder for someone who loses everything everywhere. It's very convenient when the item is simply lost in the house. I believe it would be nicer if everyone in the world used a tile so that the software would be able to constantly locate a missing item but that's just not the case. However, we did lose a wallet in someone's car after being dropped off at home. The app last located the item at the house which was the last time the phone and wallet were together. After asking the person to look in there car, they were unable to find it. But one day when the phone was near that same car it was able to pick up the signal coming from the tile and we ended up finding it wedged deep down between the seats. That being said, if someone were to steal your item, it's probably not going to help but the way the tile works in telling you its last location is super useful."}

I am the type of person to frequently lose things. I purchased this tile mate with the hopes of putting my days of lost keys to an end. So the first one that I had lasted maybe a week or a week and a half and suddenly, it would not make a sound. It would connect to my phone, but when I attempted to play a sound.. nothing. I contacted customer service, and after asking me a bunch of questions that I already answered in my initial email, they finally agreed to send me a replacement.\nWith the replacement, the speaker at least works. But this thing is not reliable in the least. On 2 or 3 different occasions, I\u2019ve lost my keys only to try to use my tile. It would show up as though the tile was not in range despite it my Bluetooth working properly. I would find my keys later (within feet of me) without the help of the useless tile.\n\nThe worst day was the day I started having difficulty breathing after floors had been pulled up in my house. My epipen was in my car, and I could not find my keys to get to it. I knew my keys were nearby, but everything was a mess from furniture being moved and I couldn\u2019t remember where I put them. I was almost in tears desperately trying to get my tile to connect so I could find my keys, which I knew where somewhere within feet of me but I just didn\u2019t know where. Of course, the Bluetooth was on and it showed the keys at my house.. but it was acting as though they weren\u2019t in range enough to ring them. I ran all over my house and still couldn\u2019t find them. After panicking for almost 15 minutes and being home alone, I finally found my keys 5 feet away from where I had been underneath a thin blanket. I was about ready to crush my tile with a hammer at this point because I was so upset by the situation.\n\nNeedless to say, I won\u2019t be purchasing these anymore. I was going to buy one for my husband and buy a wallet version for myself, but after my issues with this one, I don\u2019t see myself doing that"}

She was hiding in various places when I first brought her into my home. I added this to her collar and labeled it with my phone number on it, just in case. The app is supposed to help you locate the tile and cause the tile to ring so you can locate it. If there is no extra noise and I\u2019m within a few feet of it, I can hear the chime. It is pretty quiet, so I have to listen carefully. The locator map on the app is off. It won\u2019t put the tile together with my phone if I\u2019m right on top of it. I was hoping to find it by following the app and walking room to room. Doesn\u2019t happen. Only way I can locate the tile is through the little chime sound. If it were outside, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever locate it."}

The tile sets off an alert sound and makes it easy to find. If he ever happened to misplace his phone but not his tester (this will never happen), he can use the tile to locate his phone. Even if the phone is in silent mode, the tile will make the phone ring and easily found."}

{"Author": "L. Solomon", "Date": "on February 13, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "GREAT IDEA, BUT IT FAILED MY \"FUNCTIONALITY TEST\"", "Text": "TILE is a splendid concept that is nicely marketed and promises to be a lifesaver. In my case, this hardware/software offering was too glitchy for any degree of dependability. It could well be that I messed something up in the programming/linking--but there is just so much time I was willing to invest on \"getting it right\". Far too many times, my iPhone 7 logged into the system and couldn't find a tile that was a foot away. Customer service says that this happens sometimes and that I should wait 3 minutes and then try again. I did this once and it failed.\n\nTo some degree, I find a lot of TILES advertised functionally to be over-stated. The prospective buyer should be aware that this is a bluetooth device ONLY (no wi-fi) and that Bluetooth technology does not serve the product well. If you are less than a hundred ft away from your wayward wallet, you can page it (as in make it beep). If successful, you'll hear an anemic tinny tune of your choice. To put it into perspective, a \"talking greeting card\" is no less than 10 times louder than a TILE. If your TILE is upstairs and you are downstairs you will not hear it. If your TILE is attached to, let's say, your keys--and said keys are located in a heavy down jacket or coat--you will not hear it. My dog DID hear it and wasn't all that happy about it.\n\nA big disappointment for me was the \"find it on the map\" interface that resembles most popular mobile map apps. More often than not, you left your keys in your car (happens to me all the time). Look for it on your Mobile Device, and you'll discover that your TILE is somewhere in the area which is not all that useful. TILE's solution to the problem involves using your iPhone as a virtual \"metal detector\". You must sweep your device back and forth until you hear/see a signal. \"You're getting warmer...warmer...Oh, No! You're getting cooler\"...and so on. You'd be amazed at how Not Fun this becomes when you're late for an appointment and can't find your damn keys!\n\nNow, I LOVE gadgets and find computer problems to be well within my expertise. I am not easily daunted by quirky set-ups. However, after an entire weekend of trying to get it right, I basically gave up and returned my 4-TILE purchase from whence it came.\n\nMost disappointing of all is that I REALLY NEED something like this! I had great expectations for TILES and am sorry it didn't work out. Judging from all the excellent reviews posted by Amazon, I must assume that your experience might be far different from mine. If you decide to try TILES, I wish you success!"}

Phone Finder. Anything Finder (Review)\n\nIf you are accustomed to misplacing your: keys, phone, remote, wallet/purse, or bag, this would be an ideal product. It is available in four different tiers: Tile Sport (Waterproof, $35), Tile Mate (Original, $20), Tile Style (Designed Tile, $35), and Tile Slim (Slimmer, $30).\n\nDesign\n\nThe tile is fairly slim (34 x34 x 4.65 mm) and minimal in weight (6.1 grams). It has a compact durable design and is water resistance for extra protection. I personally use tile mate for my keys and wallet, but it can be attached to any item via keychain/adhesive strips.\n\nOn the surface of the tile, there is a grey \"track\" button. Many times, I have had keys placed in a pocket and have accidently activated this button. This results in a loud pinging noise from the device and can be pretty annoying. However, this is only a small issue in the design and doesn't take away from its functionality.\n\nBattery Life\n\nThe product came with a \"One year from shipment\" battery life expectancy. Tile didn't put much effort forth with this form of battery management, but they do offer a reTile program. This program allows users to replace their Tile each year at a discounted price.\n\nFunctionality\n\nThe product functions via Bluetooth technology. Your smart device must have Bluetooth enabled at all times for it to properly operate. This was a pain at times when trying to conserve battery life for my phone but was necessary to keep track of my items.\n\nTile also has a mandatory application you must download in order to manage/track all your items. The application seemed to be user friendly and easy to navigate through. All you do is go on the application, locate the lost item, and click track. It also has an interesting feature that allows you to ping your smart devices even if they are on silent/vibrate.\n\nTile's default pinging noise is set at 88 decibels, which is effective for most individuals. Even when my wallet was buried deep in a pile of clothes, I was able to seek it out. All in all, the product is ideal for consumers looking for an inexpensive device tracker. It is a good size for any item you choose to use it for and does exactly what it's designed to do."}

I wouldn't say setup was a breeze and can take a little bit of time, but it's easy if you're patient. The app has to remain open at all times, but it has an easy interface to use and lets you customize the ringtones (which may very well get annoying if you lose your stuff frequently).\n\nThe thing that I don't like about tiles is that these have to be replaced on a yearly basis - the app will notify you and Tile gives you the option to buy new ones at a discount (called reTile), but for me the discount was only a few dollars after tax and shipping fees (yes they charge shipping fees for reTiles - stay classy, Tile). I ended up buying it for cheaper elsewhere online. I'm not sure if I'll stick with it after a second year as I've spread about $150 so far - getting 2 4x packs in 2017 and then 1 8x pack in 2018.\n\nIf Tile's competitors did not have such bad reviews (especially Trackr which only requires a cheap coin battery replacement), I'd be more inclined to go with those.\n\nAlso, while Tile supposedly has a bigger user network than its competitors to help you find your stuff, it's really only going to come in handy if you live in a big city with lots of users."}

These are also often the scenarios where you're most likely to lose something (e.g. airports and other travel).\n\nWeakness 2: no battery replacement option, so tile is decent price for a non-disposable product but overpriced for a disposable one (i.e. $15-20/tile is too much to throw away every 6-12 months)\n\nRecommendation: These guys need to come up with a GPS solution on the tile itself as others have. This daisy chained linking of the bluetooth tile, to the GPS enable phone, to the internet and back is dumb.\n\nI'm sure they know this, but want to milk this product for a while, and are having a hard time getting the product small enough with a GPS in it."}

{"Author": "D. Metzger", "Date": "on January 25, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Jury's Still Out", "Text": "I'm still trying to decide. My initial impression of the Tile was good. Even though, like with some less sophisticated locators, you have to play a game of \"warmer/colder\" to get within Bluetooth range to ring the tile, it seemed to work well at first. Well enough, in fact, that I followed up with a four-pack and stuck one on various often-lost devices.\n\nThen, today, my cat (the first Tile recipient) shed his quick-release collar, and I tried to use the Tile app to find it. Nothing. Even after I found the collar by sight and held it in my hand, the app did not see the Tile. I tried pressing the button on the Tile device to ring my phone but, again, nothing. Since buying the Tile, I've left my Bluetooth active all of the time, hoping that the app would use it to keep track of my devices. It doesn't.\n\nI thought maybe the Tile's battery had already died, despite the fact that I'd only had it for three weeks. Then, I tried one of the others. Nothing. Tried another. Also nothing. I tried replacing the cat's tile with the remaining new one from the four-pack. Still nothing.\n\n\"Okay,\" I thought, \"it's apparently not the Tile itself. Maybe it's the app?\" I turned off my phone and rebooted it. Suddenly, the cat's \"missing\" tile was found. I was able to ring it, too. Good news, that! But now I'm left feeling I can't really trust the app or the devices.\n\nI'll give it some more time.\n\nWhat I DO like is that the Tiles are small and light enough to use on small cats' and dogs' collars. They're still not quite as small as I'd like, but they're not nearly as large and clunky as most of the other devices I've seen. When a pet goes missing, though, I don't want to have to worry about whether the battery has died without my knowing it, or that the app might have suddenly gone wonky.\n\nSuggestions to manufacturer: Can you perhaps add a \"low battery\" alert to the app? Also, when Bluetooth is turned on, your app needs to ping the device every half hour or hour, so that it's always keeping track of where things are. As it is, despite having my Bluetooth turned on constantly, the app said today that its last recorded \"sighting\" of my cat's Tile was two days ago, even though the cat has been here with me the whole time. That's unacceptable."}

But the performance of the product is inconsistent which becomes a significant problem given the nature of the product.\n\nThe Tile system uses bluetooth to communicate between the Tile and the app on your phone. This limits the range of the device and provides only proximity detection. To resolve this problem, when locating a Tile device, the device plays a sound. Since the Tile device is not rechargeable and does not take a replacement battery, some thought had to be put into how to extend the battery life. A constant connection between the phone app and the tile is infeasible to maintain over the course of a year on a single battery.\n\nThe unfortunate end result is that the Tile system only irregularly connects to and can locate Tile devices. Standing in my kitchen with my phone in one hand and the Tile device in the other, the bluetooth did not connect and would not locate the Tile device.\n\nAt a larger scale, the GPS location of a Tile device is imprecise as well. As a test, I ensured that a Tile was connected to my phone via BlueTooth. I then left the tile in my car in long-term parking at the airport while I was gone on a trip. When I returned, I attempted to use the last known position function. The end result? The position wasn't close. If I had, say, dropped my keys the functionality would have been useless.\n\nIf the Tile were a one-time purchase, this inexact location system would be helpful. But as an expensive, annual subscription for new devices? It is nearly useless in practice."}

I find out because the company starts emailing me. So I go to figure out how to change the battery, no big deal right? Well apparently you can\u2019t. They designed it so you must buy a new one! Sure it\u2019s at a discounted price, but still much more than a battery. What a crock of shi#! They could have made the battery accessible, but nope! What an unethical scam!"}

Tile saved me a huge iPhone deductible charge with my phone loss insurance- thank you so much Tile!!! The \u201cfind my iPhone\u201d function would not work unless I entered an authentication code which I could not access because I didn\u2019t have my iPhone to get the code?!?! How ridiculous is that, Apple?? So I logged on to my online account with Tile that I set up when I installed the Tile app. Tile showed me within maybe a 10 foot radius exactly where my iPhone was- 2 hours away lying on the ground at an I-95 rest stop where it had fallen out of my pocket! It was giving me a live signal too and displayed how long it was there pinging the location. Using the Tile on my keychain I was able to make my iPhone ring (works even if the ringer is off) and found it lying in the snow exactly where the website said it was. Again, thank you so much Tile! Tile worked when my Apple iCloud account wouldn\u2019t let me access the location without a verification code (even though I was logged into my iCloud account).\nFor the negative reviewers: $20-30 for a tile and web view locator via Tile website, and you\u2019re complaining about the 1 year battery??? Really?"}

After loosing his keys Numerous times my sons wife activated his tile and its been a life saver !! He's lost his keys on the job site several times and was able to find them in places where he would not have looked. Just recently he unknowingly dropped his keys on the ground outside his building ,while trying to locate, the tile indicated it had left the parking lot. My son was frantic , calling a lock smith and then the car dealer to find a new set of keys and ignition would cost around $600 dollars . Then I reminded him of the \"Tile Community \" ,he logged on to the app , listed his Keys as Stolen and within minutes he had 6 pings . Long story short , with the help of the Tile Community he was able to locate the keys to a Apartment complex 30 miles away and recognized a car that was parked next to his when they came up missing. After confronting the individual - who was with full intent going to go back and steal my sons car , the keys were handed over and then the tile . My son couldn't of thanked me enough for this gift. After 3 years the battery is still working, and it has saved him hundreds of dollars and an almost stolen car. THANK YOU TILE !!!!"}

{"Author": "Darren", "Date": "on December 29, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "no issues - Tile made it easy when we got to the Bahamas to locate our ...", "Text": "This is a really neat device. We purchased this specifically to put on our checked luggage for out last trip outside the country, and it worked very well.\n\nAs the description says, it uses Bluetooth to connect to the device, so it does have a limited range. This isn't a GPS device, meaning you will need to be within a 100 feet or so for it to work, but don't let that deter you. Tile is the most popular product in this niche market, meaning there are a lot of people out there with Tiles of their own, and if they have the Tile app, they can anonymously locate your Tile for you if they are nearby it - which works surprisingly well in a place such as an Airport where people are actively using Tiles.\n\nSo why 5 stars? Well here's my story. My wife and I recently traveled to the Bahamas on our Honeymoon. We flew Delta, and had a layover in Atlanta. On the way down, no issues - Tile made it easy when we got to the Bahamas to locate our bag on the carousel, and allowed us to get to Customs before everyone else. The true value of Tile was on the way back. We unfortunately got stuck in Atlanta for TWO DAYS due to a snow \"storm\". We landed in Atlanta around lunch, and our connecting flight to our final destination was delayed multiple times over 12 hours, then finally cancelled (along with 1,000 other flights). At that point, it was 1:00AM and all we wanted to do was get our checked bag that had all of our clothes, and find a hotel. Well, if it was only that simple... Delta was not allowing people to get their checked bags, and said that the bags would be forwarded along to our final destination at some point, most likely before we would get there. I could go on about how frustrating this was, but in the end Tile saved the day or at least relieved a lot of stress. Since Delta's operations essentially \"rebooted\" in Atlanta, tracking our bag on the Delta app was useless. When we arrived at the airport to catch our flight two days later, we spoke with Baggage and they said that they didn't know where our bag was. We checked the Tile app multiple times, with no luck on locating it - not surprising because a lot of the bags are held in their storage facility which is away from the terminal, away from Tile users. About 30 minutes before we boarded the plane to our final destination, the gate attendant told us that our bag was already at our home airport and arrived the day before. At this point, nothing on the Tile app, and the Delta app wasn't showing any updates. This news was a little bit of a relief, but at the same time stressful thinking that it's just sitting on the carousel in our airport waiting to be stolen. Fast forward to us sitting on the plane waiting to take off... all of a sudden I get a notification from my Tile app saying that my luggage has been located! Wouldn't you know, it was located exactly at my current location - what does this mean? It was on the plane with me! What a huge relief... Tile is a great product... we landed at our home airport and then the Tile came out on the carousel playing it's little tune and we were on our way home. I want to point out that when the luggage hit the carousel, our bag didn't come out at first - it actually came out about 15 minutes after the rest of the bags for some reason. If we didn't have the Tile app, we wouldn't have known to look for it on the carousel, and if we did, we would have likely walked away to go find Baggage causing more confusion.\n\nThis isn't the end for our Tile... we will use it again while traveling, but in the mean time we put it on our cat's collar - he's notorious for \"escaping\" our house... Haven't had to use it to find him, but if he does escape, it will hopefully help.\n\nStop thinking - just buy one - they are cheap and extremely useful. Battery lasts a year then you need to buy a new one, but I've spent more money on lunch in a single day - who cares!"}

Otherwise it\u2019s useless and prettt much never rings when you tell it to so when it\u2019s actually time to use it you\u2019re stuck in the same predicament you would have been anyway. I only bought it to ring to save time looking for my keys but it rarely even goes \u201cgreen\u201d to let you ring it and when you do get the \u201cgreen\u201d it doesn\u2019t ring. Terrible product awesome concept.\n\nDoesn\u2019t work as expected 50% or the time. Only rings from my phone sometimes. I can usually call my\nPhone from the tile but that\u2019s not what i bought it for. The app will show that it is ringing and it\u2019s not.

She has lost her phone 3 times since then; each time, the tile has not rang her phone. Each time we finally locate the phone, we open the tile app, looks like everything's connected how it should be, we try it out again, and it works. The performance of the Tile is VERY inconsistent and we learned quickly that it won't be useful for my daughter to keep track of her phone. So, looks like we got a $20 key chain.

From what I\u2019ve seen, they charge a fee for this. So, something that cost me $50 now will cost me more because I guess the general public isn\u2019t intelligent enough to change batteries. So, I found a poor fellow on YouTube who shows one how to saw through the Tile with a kitchen knife. Pretty cool, huh?? I opted to try the \u201cpull apart method\u201d using channel lock pliers. As soon as I tightened them down, it flew apart. Cool, right?? That was easy. So now, I will try to replace the batteries. Stay tuned for an update.\n\nI find this whole system ridiculous because there is no easy way to replace these batteries. I understand that batteries run out but how about making it easy for the consumer to change them INSTEAD OF HITTING THEM AGAIN WITH ANOTHER CHARGE. I will never buy another one of these again.

I lost ascetic keys my remote truck key attached, it costs a75 $ to replace that key.\n\nSo much for tiles helping make my life easier."}

{"Author": "Joe Joe", "Date": "on December 22, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "it's a great concept. Tile is just glitchy and getting support ...", "Text": "I've used this for a few years, it's a great concept. Tile is just glitchy and getting support from them (off of their site) has been difficult. I've gone from being okay with it to not liking it over the years. They could fix the problems, it's not a problem with the concept.\n\nI'm an early adopter, I've had Tiles since they first came out, then the new versions (I was most excited about the Tile slim as I needed help with my wallet). I'm currently on a Pixel 2 XL. I'm okay with glitchy, I appreciate support but I understand that young companies can be resource constrained. I was surprised recently because they seem to be doing a pretty aggressive marketing blitz.\n\nI had ordered extra Tile Slims to get a discount (this was a mistake). After the Tile slim's battery had died, I replaced it with the extra Tile slim I had purchased, repeatedly tried, no success, guidance on app was not helpful. Guidance in support of app was also not helpful. I had tried reaching out via Tile's website but I haven't heard back. Frustrated, but still hoping to give Tile a chance, so I ordered another Tile (mate this time). The handshake seems like it should be simple enough, I press the button on the tile, I initiate the pairing in the Tile app and wait. and wait. and wait. So, I changed devices, tablet this time. As I've just learned Tile doesn't work on tablet because of required permissions for location tracking. I've tried it on another phone, checking that the Bluetooth is working (it works with my hands-free car stuff) but no luck.\n\nOverall, I'd say that the app is pretty battery heavy an a bit glitchy and connectivity with the tiles is okay but a solid B since it's so nice to be able to recover my wallet, bag, dopkit, gym bag when I'm trying to get out of the house.\n\nI'm mainly posting on here because my attempts to contact Tile have been unsuccessful until now and I'm hoping that this encourages a meaningul response that gets my stuff working again. This is really the power of Amazon that I appreciate."}

Literally, I\u2019ll be in my bed lifting the comforter and sheets trying to find my phone, but with Tile on my keys I just double-click the button and my phone starts making this chiming type sound. And then I find it, even if it\u2019s on silent. It\u2019s great. Same for keys. When I can\u2019t find them, I go on my app and hit \u201cFind\u201d and the same sound chimes. The ONLY thing I sort of don\u2019t like about it is the fact that you have to keep your Tile app open in the background at all times and same with your Bluetooth, for the Tile to do its job. But don\u2019t let that stand in the way of purchasing this.\n\nI went out to this club with my friends and I got wasted. Basically, my driver said don\u2019t get out of the car and I did the exact opposite and my phone fell out in my friends driveway. I got back in and got home and freaked out. BUT you know what helped me find it? TILE. I went on the website and signed in it gave me the address to the house where my phone was sitting in the driveway in a corner. So grateful for this little invention and I\u2019m going to order another. You never know when you\u2019ll need it."}
{"Author": "avid reader", "Date": "on December 20, 2017", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Deceptive pricing and poor customer service from Tile", "Text": "This review has to do with the Tile company vs. the product itself. I received a Tile as a gift last year and although my Tile is still working, after receiving several emails and a \"final notice\" from reTile, I decided to purchase a 4-pack through the reTile program. I did research to ensure I would be able to keep one and gift the others and was told that during the holiday, individual pouches would be included with all multiple orders. Based on this and the fact that reTile's website guaranteed that by \"purchasing through reTile, our loyal customers will always receive the best price available\", I went ahead and made the purchase. Shipping was fast but when I opened the package there were no individual pouches and no mention of them. When I was on Tlle's website trying to figure out how to contact them, I saw the 4-pack advertised to the general public at $50, while I (one of their loyal customers) paid $55 only 3 days ago. I decided to check \"final notice\" email from reTile, and the price there was now $47 ($8 less than I paid 3 days ago). Tiles response was they were out of gift pouches (I guess they hoped I wouldn't notice) and they suggested I go to their website and print out the manuals to give with each of the tiles. Really??? After talking to the \"higher powers\", the rep I was chatting with did offer to refund the difference. It took too much insistence on my part to get to this point, and combined with the suggestion of printing my own instruction manuals, the whole experience left me not wanting to support this company. Instead of handing Tile three new customers, I opted for a refund. When my existing Tile dies, it will not be replaced. It is a good product and serves a useful purpose, but I will not support a company that I feel is dishonest."}

When you double press on the key fob, your phone will ring audibly even if it is on silent and even if the app was not open on the phone when the key fob button is double-clicked. The only downside is that the find phone function won\u2019t work unless Bluetooth just happens to be enabled on the phone when you misplace it. Of course, you can also use the app on the phone to find your keys or whatever the fob is attached to, limited by the range of your Bluetooth connection. Mine will basically find the fob anywhere in the house and possibly a few feet outside of it.\n\nThe Tile Mate version looks a bit flimsy and I\u2019m not sure that it will really hold up to being attached to a set of keys that are dragged in and out of pockets and so forth. However, they do make a more robust model that appears to have a sturdier case if this becomes an issue."}

The app would show that it was ringing but it wasn't. When I located my keys, they would be silent even though the app was still showing them ringing.\n3) When it did ring it wasn't very loud. If my keys where under something like a coat, pillow or couch cushion, I could not hear it ringing until I moved the item off the tile.

I have even lost my phone and the tile can actually alert your phone to go off whenever you misplace it. The biggest complaint i have is that although the battery lasts about a year you have to mail it in the get a new tile battery and they do charge you. There are other products that do the same thing and even send you batteries for free, I have recently switched to that product and it is cheaper as well. If the prices were lower or at the very least, the batteries were replaced for free or cheaper I would come back to using Tile."}

But theres good thing to if you were to lose your phone it can locate your phone even if it is on silent But one big drawback in my opinion is that you can't replace the battery once its done its done and return it and they replace it for a fee of coarse? That really sucks!!\n\nPro Pretty easy to set up\nCan find your phone with this device even on silent\n\nCons It does drop the signal\nYou can't replace the battery GREED!! IMO"}

My number one complaint however is their business model markets them as an item that should be stuck on your baseball glove and your Xbox remotes, and every other loseable item in your house. I realize they would love for you to have 10 or 20 of them. But my complaint is the battery lasts a year and the pester you for months leading up to that year that it\u2019s time to replace and they even offer you a discount but it 15 or $20 a piece for the replacement cost it is a roadblock to taking an existing customer that obviously liked your product and creating a long time loyal customer by charging you 15 or $20 a year per item for a battery replacement basically. My tile slim in my wallet is always setting off my phone accidentally when I sit on it. This causes the battery to die even quicker. I can not and will not continue to spend $100 per year to be a Tile user."}

I gave 4 stars because it\u2019s far from perfect\u2014-but in the end I got Dilbert back. The facts: I had only had my cat 3 weeks and he of course wanted to go outside like the others so I put a light on him and this tile. Last night he didn\u2019t come home and the tile said he was last seen 4 hours before, near my house. First criticism: the map function basically does not work. The only clue I had was that he was last seen on my street and heading east when he drifted out of the 100 foot range. I was originally thinking that the receiver would be powerful enough to pinpoint his current whereabouts and show me on the map. No. I started out walking with my ap open looking for him, and covered about 1 circular mile around my house with no luck. I took a break and went home, checked back 5 min after returning home, and the ap now read he had been spotted 20 minutes before. But no new info: just on my street to the east. I wish it would have sentme a text alert but luckily I kept checking every few minutes and not much time had passed, so out I went again, covering the exact same ground as before. This time, the app picked him up across the street about three houses from mine, hiding in the bushes. I\u2019m pretty sure he had been there all morning because cats prowl at night then sleep in the early morning to mid day hours and he looked like he\u2019d been sleeping. So I\u2019m pretty sure the ap had failed to alert me the first time I walked passed him (Within 15 feet of him). Still, it did at least let me know he had been spotted more recently (did my own app pick him up when I passed the first time but not update me?) and honestly without the chime playing, I never would have found him on my own. He was scared and hiding and I am certain he had no clue how to get home. I hope the company keeps working on their app. For people searching for a lost animal\u2014-cat in particular\u2014\u2014I would like to suggest walking very slowly, and keep turning the phone in different directions. I think that made a big difference."}

I'm someone who misplaces everything, so this seems like it would be perfect for me. I purchased it after I lost my car key at the beach a few months back. The cost for a replacement key was $200, and it was at this point I realized I should have a contingency plan if my keys go missing again. The Tile itself is thin and fits fine on my keychain. Pairing it with my phone was simple. The app is intuitive and easy to use. The problem I have is that while my keys are in my pocket, the slightest movement triggers the push button on the Tile. The Tile has a feature where if you push the button twice, your phone sounds an alarm so that you can locate it in case you can't remember where you've placed your phone. Cool feature, but it's driving me insane at how easily this goes off simply by just carrying your keys around in your pocket. It's getting to the point where I don't even want to have the Tile on me anymore. It goes off at least twice a day, most days it'll accidentally go off 6+ times. When this happens, I have to reach for my phone and click \"Found it\" in the app so that it stops the alarm. It's become such a daily nuisance that I wonder if it's even worth keeping at this point. What a shame, because I really would like it otherwise."}

She couldn't find her keys and dutifully went to the phone app and pressed the \"Find Keys\" button. Nothing happened, and we kept pressing the button as we moved from room to room listening for the alert. Still nothing. We finally found the keys without the help of the Tile Mate and eventually discovered that the product had failed. The company replaced the Tile Mate and we were reasonably happy with their customer services. But to our disappointment the next time my wife lost her keys we had the exact same problem - the replacement Tile Mate failed just like the first. This is a great idea for a very useful product. Unfortunately the company has not produced a reliable product that can stand up to the daily jostling that items like keys go through. NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME!"}

Also, they're aggressively upselling and I've more than once had the \"somebody found your tile, (insert name), do you want to thank him/her\" when my tiles were safely in my possession and I never indicated that I was looking for them. I have also been told I helped somebody find their tile, which frankly at this point I think is bunk. I like the idea of being able to find my luggage should it go walkabout, but I'm getting less and less convinced it's more than very expensive snake-oil."}

Useful for finding my keys around the house because before I had the Tile I failed to train myself to put them in the same spot. I say before because my tile battery expired 80 days ago. Since then I have put them in the same drawer SO thank you tile for that.\n\nToday I finally decided to swap out the battery on my tile only to learn you CANNOT swap out the battery on the tile. But I CAN turn them in for a new one...for a fee. The tile is supposed to last one year. Mine did not. I purchased them in December, activated in late January and they lasted until the end of August. They are guaranteed to last a year. I can apply for a replacement - that's why I am here to get my proof of purchase - but not sure if I can at this late date. So if you buy them -- register them. One would think they would automatically be registered when once you set them up in the app. Because technology.\n\nTwo thoughts about them while they worked:\n1. If you keep your keys in your pocket you will invariably set off the phone alarm. This happens about once a day. So maybe that's why the battery died early. However, I should be allowed to lose my keys once a day.\n2. About halfway through the alarm in the tile stopped working effectively. The app could \"see\" the tile but when the alarm was activated there was no sound. I would just end up walking around the house looking at the \"you're close!\" alert and then try to guess where nearby I would have set my keys or where they may have fallen out.\n\nEven though I will attempt to get a replacement because..heck...I paid for at least a year. I am going to try a competitor called TrackR Bravo. That one allows user replacement of the battery for the same cost. And on the plus side looks more fashionable. Because I am very shallow about my car keys appearance. Especially when valet parking."}

Despite multiple keyboards, which my children have already installed in the house because of this, the keychain was always there, where he actually does not belong. The search for it not only cost time, but also annoying my children extremely, which I had involved in my eternal searches with.\n\nThis shortcoming has been haunting me for almost 30 years, until I became aware of \"Tile\" at the beginning of this year through an ad that appeared on Facebook. This small square and flat \"thing\" seemed to be the solution to my problem of constant keychain searching.\n\nUnfortunately you can not rely 100% on the deposited customer reviews, but I ordered a \"Tile Mate\" directly; the almost 30 euros were worth the risk. These almost 30 euros had been the best 30 euros, which I spent for something!\n\nAfter the \"Tile\" arrived a few days later, I attached it directly to my keychain. The matching app was quickly installed and set up. Since then, after so many years, my problem has not been solved, my keychain always somewhere to lie down, but the search for it has been relieved by 100% and cost me as good as no more time: one click in the app on mine iPhone and I just have to follow the ringtone of the \"Tile\" to find my keychain. Not only is this an incredible relief to me, but I also do not have to listen to the shrieking and constant reproach of my children for acclimating me to hang the keys on one of the keyboards.\n\nAnd not only that with the \"Tile\" I can now locate my keychain within seconds, vice versa, it also works with the smartphone: once pressed on the \"Tile\" \"rings my iPhone, so that I have found this immediately.\n\nAs it is similar to my wallet, as with my keychain, I have now ordered a second \"tile\", the \"Tile Slim\" ordered, which is a bit flatter and therefore fits perfectly in the wallet. A third, the \"Tile Sport\" I have ordered for our dog. Since this loving stray dog escapes through the front door every now and then, I can then locate it thanks to the \"Tile\" directly, without looking for the whole family and acquaintances after him.\n\nI say yes: \"Tile\" - for me the innovation par excellence and I would NEVER MISS IT!\n\nHad it already been around 15 years ago? I lost the key to our business back then. It was not just \"a\" key, but the GENERAL KEY of a comprehensive locking system that not only opened / closed almost all the doors in our factory, but also in our private home, but also to the doors of many of our branches ( among other things in large supermarkets) belonged. The subsequent investment of a completely new locking system that was unfortunately necessary cost around 5,000 euros at that time, which had not been covered by the insurance. Damn a lot of money, an issue that really hurt really. Had I already had a \"Tile\" at the time, I would have definitely spared those costs and the associated hassle and effort.\n\nTherefore, I can only anyone who can not get used to his keys to a key board or similar. to hang, advise and warmly recommend: buy such a \"Tile\"!\n\nYesterday it freed me from a really awkward situation.\nI had to go by train to an out-of-town appointment. After I bought a cappuccino in a caf\u00e9 near the train station just before leaving, two minutes before departure I realized that I did not have my keychain in my bag. Immediately I activated the search through the app on my iPhone, which indicated to me that it was in the caf\u00e9 and that \"happily rang\". However, I had absolutely no time left to run there because the train was already leaving. In my \"Tile\" -less times, I would have gone in panic searching my way gone and would definitely missed the train and thus my appointment. But now I knew immediately where my keys were: even on the train Google was thanked the phone number of the caf\u00e9 quickly found out and immediately afterwards I have with the condition the later pickup of my bunch of keys can agree. This had already become aware of the keychain by the ringing of the \"Tile\" and had taken it for safekeeping. A triple high on this amazing technology!\n\nTHANKS to the inventors and developers of \"Tile\". You have made life a little easier for me :-)"}

I purchased 4 Tiles last December though Amazon. At the time it was not made clear through Amazon that these only last 1 year. Today I received an email and app notification from tile that the batteries are going to die for good! Apparently these only last 1 year and cannot be charged or replaced. This is either a design flaw or planned obsolescence. Either way, it's definitely a negative experience for the product as a whole.\n\nHonestly, these tiles only work about 50% of the time which is very frustrating. Many times they won't connect, helplessly chirp an error when pressed, or can't be found even right next to the phone.\n\nI'm sorry, but this product is certainly not what I expected it to be so I won't be upgrading my tiles after they die. I certainly wouldn't recommend them anymore..."}

Initially I thought it was a good purchase. I was able to test the locator and had fun hiding the tile around the house and letting my daughters try to find it. That is where the positives ended. In order for a finder to work properly it should be reliable and react quickly to a request to find either the tile itself or the phone to which it is supposed to be connected. A month or so after I had set up the tile and linked it to my phone I misplaced my keys. I knew they were in the house but not exactly where, great I thought, this is exactly why I bought a tile. I opened my phone and requested it to ring the tile in question, the phone gave me the little spinning wait indication and told me that my tile was nearby and was currently being connected to the phone. After a minute or so of this I resumed my manual search and was finally able to locate my keys. This scenario repeated itself several more times until I finally gave up and just removed the tile from my key chain. The reverse action was also not useful. When I had both the phone and the tile in my possession and had recently connected them and made sure they were talking properly I was able to push the button on the tile and my phone rang. That is great but when I have actually misplaced my phone and am trying to locate it the results were not very useful. I would walk around my house pushing the button on the tile hoping to hear my phone ringing. Not once of the two or three times that I tried this did my phone ring. I could be 5 feet away and push the button and no ring. When I did locate my phone, reconnect the tile and then push the button the phone rang but that is not why I bought the device. I don't need my phone to ring when I have both my phone and the tile in my hands I need the phone to ring when it is lost.\n\nI really wanted to like this device and my initial tests were positive but in the end this device does not do what I purchased it to do, locate my keys and/or my phone. I am following reviews in hopes that other products or latter releases of this product increase dependability to the point where it can actually be used for its intended purpose."}

Planned obsolescence.\n\nAfter one year from activation, regardless of actual usage or battery draw, Tile modules \u201cexpire\u201d requiring paid replacement per unit.\n\nThis directly contradicts Tile\u2019s own statements from the FAQ support section of their website which states:\n\nHow long will Tile last?\n\nEach Tile tracking tag lasts for one year from the date of activation. Tiles do not expire after a year of use, however we highly recommend replacing each Tile on an annual basis to ensure reliability when you need to find your things. Tile is designed to be reliable and always allow you to find your stuff. After a year, while the battery may still have power, your ability to find your Tile will be decreased from the optimal state.\n\nIn our journey to create a simple and sleek Tile, we discovered that battery replacement became a tradeoff for other factors. The biggest factor was creating a sealed device that is not only waterproof but also prevents dirt and/or other corrosion from getting in. In addition, it means there are no screws or other pieces of \"hardware\" which allowed us to create a simpler and sleeker product to fit in with your life and your style.\n\n......\nI\u2019ve written a reply email to Tile\u2019s reminder email for me to reTile (and a convenient advertisement of their new Tile Pro series tracking modules):\n\nHello,\nI currently use 9 tiles to track my things.\n\nI\u2019ve just spent the last few hours reading reviews and watching disassembly/battery replacement videos about the widely known issue of Tile\u2019s software-based timed expiration issue that I\u2019ve recently encountered for the first time.\n\nI understand that it\u2019s not a profit strategy that you personally implemented but I\u2019m pretty upset about it considering that I rarely use my Tiles and they all still ring just fine but are somehow now all \u201cexpired\u201d on the same date regardless of how they were actually used and how the battery was drawn from or not during this past year.\n\nThe few times I have used Tile to find my things, it\u2019s been quite helpful. But now I\u2019m facing a steep replacement or reTile cost for my many tiles, which already had an expensive entry cost.\n\nGiven that the planned obsolescence strategy exists with the 2nd generation of Tile modules, my question is....do the new Tile Pro series modules also \u201cexpire\u201d one year after their activation regardless of actual usage, or will these units work until their battery actually becomes drained to the point where the Bluetooth antenna can no longer TX/RX signal?\n\nLooking forward to an honest, technical response.\n\nThank you\n\nThe beginning portion or Tile\u2019s reTile reminder email, that I replied to:\nOn Oct 3, 2017, at 08:08, Christina, Tile Customer Care <care@email.thetileapp.com> wrote:\n\ntile reTile Now\n\nIt\u2019s time to replace your Tile Upgrade now and save up to 40% with our reTile program. | reTile Now\n\nDear\n\nTiles are designed to last a full year with no charging and zero upkeep. This is a friendly reminder that your Tile\u2019s year of service is coming to an end and it\u2019s ready to be replaced. Once the battery runs out, your Tile will stop working and you will no longer be able to locate and ring your misplaced items.\n\nAs a loyal Tile customer, you\u2019re eligible to upgrade and get the latest and greatest Tile technology at an exclusive members-only price.\n\nSincerely,\nThe Tile Customer Care Team"}

What they don\u2019t tell you is that they count down the days from the time you activate it until 365 days later when the watch battery inside is set to die. Then they want to sell you new ones. Two things: 1.) why should you spend this much money on something designed to fail after a year forcing you to buy a new device. It\u2019s worse than having to buy anew software update each and every year. 2.) it is designed to fail if you don\u2019t buy a new on, so what happens to your valuable item if you don\u2019t send it in on time? It gets lost and you cannot rely on your tile to find it since the battery and the software no longer work together. If you like gimmicks and don\u2019t mind spending money every year on another new Tile (or four), go ahead. It\u2019s a waste of money year after year... is what you are tracking really worth spending money each year???"}

I bought the Tile Mate to replace my old Gen 1 Tile. My Gen 1 was phenomenal, absolutely worked every time I rang it from my phone, and it even lasted for roughly 15 months. Now back to the Tile Mate. Worked great for 2 months, after that, when I would try to ring the Tile Mate from my phone it never made a sound. Was always in range or \u201cNear By\u201d as it would say in the app but would not make a sound, even with the Tile Mate in my hand beside my phone, so pretty useless when I was actually looking for my keys. I contacted Tile and after going through their procedures to find out if the Tile was functioning correctly, which it was not, dead silence from Tile. Absolutely horrible customer service. Did not return emails for refund or new Tile Mate, absolute radio silence. I raved to friends about the original Tile, but after the performance of the Mate never again will Tile have me as a customer. I definitely do not recommend this product, because it will let you down when you need it to actually do what it\u2019s intened to do. Save your money folks and look for alternatives!!! Zero stars if I could!!!!"}

The good part is that we were able to check in on her from Asia and it would tell us her last location. The bad part is that this would sometimes ping somewhere out of range and tell us that she was on a main road 10 blocks away. This caused a few major freak outs from us and had us calling home to make sure she was ok. Long story short, she had never been 10 blocks away and never escaped (confirmed by several people). The app was wrong. We ARE buying a new one for our next trip (bc something is better than nothing), but still wish it would be a little more accurate.

However, I found a set of lost keys with Tile attached to it. This was exciting. I thought I could get first hand experience on helping return the lost keys to the rightful owner. I'm not sure why Tile management decided to not create a feature where I can return the lost keys/Tile to the owner. I am not able to be in contact with the owner. I can only download the Tile app and turn on my bluetooth so the owner of the lost keys can find me. This is a bit lame. What if the owner is not near the location where the keys/Tile were lost?!?! So yes, I've downloaded the Tile app and placed the lost keys/Tile near my phone so the owner will be notified that a \"community member\" has located her keys/Tile. Sounds like Tile could easily allow communication between us so I can mail the keys back to the owner or arrange some other way to return the keys. I'm thinking it will be useful for Tile owner or non Tile owners to just put their emails with their keys so when lost, the parties can connect and get the items returned. I'm not planning on purchasing Tile anymore until they improve their product."}

I eventually find my keys the old fashioned way. I place my keys next to my phone. The tile app still can't see my keys. Eventually, I close the app and reopen it and it finds the keys.

These tiny devices saved my life on many occasions ( keys, wallet; I literally left my wallet inside a 19 level building, inside the cabinets of a cubicle that wasn't mine on the 12 floor and I found it in 10 min). The cons is after a year you have to replace them because the battery dies. Now if you're like me when you purchase something ( I have a 4 pack) you like to own it and not have to feel obliged to pay a monthly fee to maintain it. I just got an email asking me to replace my tile at a members price.. that's cool and nice and all that but I'm not going to keep paying $100 a year. Why can't I just charge my tile myself? That's a turn off for me. As much as I love my tile I'm not happy about that part. Overall it's an amazing product"}

She tends to hide them places. So I bought a Tile Mate, and attached to a cord which we use to hold her hearing aids together. Basically just an eye-glass cord. I secured the Tile with a small cable tie, and also added a metal badge clip to attach to her clothing. About a week ago mom lost her hearing aids. I went over to the Nursing Home, and opened up the app, and sure enough, it detected them nearby. I pressed the find me link on the phone and the chime began sounding off. I opened up a drawer and could hear the chime loudly, but didn't see the hearing aids. Picked up a little bag with a necklace in it, and the sound followed the bag. Sure enough, the hearing aids were in there. Success. Well, she misplaced them again today, and they were not nearby. Have not located them yet, but on the lookout using the notification feature. Also notified the staff about the problem.\nUpdate: Mom's hearing aids \"found\" with help of the Tile Mate. Returned to search for her hearing aids last Thursday, some suggested I look in the laundry area, so I opened up the app and while I was walking down the aisle the app, came alive with the Found flashing like crazy, I turned on the find me to activate the tiles chimes, and a lady in the laundry came running out with the hearing aids.

I have 4 tile devices and I've not had any luck with making them useful for any period of time. There needs to be some sort of an indicator as to when the battery is dying and you should be able to replace the battery on your own. Unfortunately while the idea is good the actual product is not.

I had come to rely on them heavily to find my keys.\nAt first I liked the smaller size, but soon discovered that the new center button gets pushed easily by accident. I had one of them completely fall apart in two pieces and it quit working. Two others do no longer ring. It took several weeks to get customer support. It is a shame there is no phone support. You have to schedule a phone call.\nTech support promised me three new tile mates. I will see if they work.\nTile mate is a huge step backwards in reliability. For this device reliability is paramount, that and the cumbersome tech support justify only one star. I will not buy another tile mate. maybe the sport version is better?"}

Well my experience is that keeping the tile app open drains my cell phone battery quite rapidly to the point where I do not want to open or run the Tile app. This seems to be the case with others. So, it is of little or no use. I have returned the one that I left unopened."}

I use it for my Keys, Bill-folder, Air-Pods, and a Charger. These actually tell you when you use their App where all these items are last located. If within range you can activate a ring tone to locate device. This works well if you start your day by seeing where these items are located.\nUsing the App later will tell you where items were last located or if they are in range. There is no separation \ud83d\udea8 alarm to notify you that you left your keys in a restaurant, but the App will give a general location.\nThat is the drawback with this unit , plus having to replace the unit after a year of use. I use the iHere3 device with my Wallet and Keys for double coverage as this device will gives you a separation \ud83d\udea8 alarm.\nNeither device has a loud sound, especially if your device is covered or in an enclosed container( suitcase)\nSince I have a tendency to lose my keys , these devices have saved me numerous times. iHere3 device has other options like recording, taking a selfie, auto location and is rechargeable. So, a combination of both gives me peace of mind. Tile needs the separation alarm and the option to replace their battery, as I will probably not replace it when they die. The iHere3 needs a charge every month but I'm on my 2nd year of use with no problems. iPhone Bluetooth does seem to have connection problems with both at times. Oh, Both will ring your phone if in range for you to find where u left it.\nWithout the separation alarm \ud83d\udea8, the Tile requires you to constantly check the App to make sure all your items are with you. Hopefully, Tile will make a revision as their device is slimmer in appearance. For now, I have 2 units for the overlapping coverage..."}

It is very frustrating. They need to upgrade/fix the battery problem. I have read other reviews on this and many others have had the same problem, although the other reviews state that the battery is dead. We have found that the battery is not dead, it is just not connecting with the connectors properly inside the tile.

Have attempted to use the app to locate my tiles on 8-10 different occasions and the system rarely works. All of the times I've used it so far I knew the tile was somewhere within my home but I still ended up finding the tile by just looking for it before the tile system located it. It often takes forever for the tile app to connect to the tile and the ring my tile function never seems to work. It also seems to randomly disconnect from the tile while searching. As far as using the tile to find my phone this system Relies on too many external factors such as your phones Bluetooth being on. You can't remotely enable Bluetooth so you're out of luck if Bluetooth happens to be off. Overall I think this system cost me way too much money for something that has only worked for me 10% of the time. I'm very disappointed in the product."}

I recently received the new Tile Mate which is a lot louder and more responsive than the original. The new tile is also slightly smaller which can decrease keychain clutter. Overall very pleased and happy to continue using Tile."}

I got my Tile to find my cats' collars when they disappear, which is very often. It works great for that purpose. However, it has also helped me locate my two cats when they hide. When the tone sounds, my cats come running out from their hiding places. I don't know why they do that, but it sure helps me locate them. I was also worried that the Tile might be too heavy for their collars, but after the initial breaking-in period, they don't seem to notice it. (Both weigh about 12 pounds). Although the Tile gets wet when my cats drinks from their water bowls, the water has not harmed the Tiles so far. Sometimes it is hard for me to hear the tone when a cat is hiding under the bed (and probably laying on the Tile), but after about 10 seconds the sound starts getting louder because he is emerging from his hiding place."}

So I regularly had my phone ringing away because when you press the Tile it's a find my phone. This annoyance didn't happen with the original tile because you had to push the \"e\" on the tile to find your phone which was not something you could do from your pocket. (2) the ringer in the Tile mate started working intermittently for me. The app on the phone recognized the tile was near, but it wouldn't make a noise. I tested the mate and sometimes it rang sometimes it didn't. There must be some connection that had gone loose. So I had to stop using it and go back to an original tile that I had still.

Being able to say, \"oh hey, I guess I should just ring my tile to find my phone\" or vice versa is quite a blessing. Not, \"well I guess it's time to lose my mind and tear my house apart.\" I did that for a looong time, regardless of how many organizational improvements I made growing up. A hint- if you ring your tile and it can't find your phone or vice versa, don't immediately assume its at the bottom of a trash compactor, walk around a little bit and try it again, the range is only about 20 ft, but the crowd sourcing aspect is great, someone will pass by said trash compactor and with a little deductive reasoning you can figure out why your tile is at the corner of blah and blah blah blah."}

These have come in handy sometimes, especially when I'm in a hurry to go out and I have to round up all my possessions before I leave the house. But there are times when they don't ring even when I summon them. And I'd imagine the crowd finding feature is almost useless outside of major city centres - I've only had one of my Tiles \"crowdfound\" here in Israel in maybe a year of using Tiles so far. Perhaps it will grow as more people adopt these, but I doubt it. They're useful for what they are, and probably better than the alternatives (at least according to my research), but still very, very limited."}
