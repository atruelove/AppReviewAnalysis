I got the lock to connect but all it does in the basic lock and unlock feature, and does not work remotely. Then I found out that I needed to download the \u201cclassic\u201d SmartThings app to have all those features available. Lies! At this time I was going back and forth with customer support. I really wanted this to work. Finally I just returned it and bought a Wink (1) for $29. Connection was easy. Just keep it away from the router and move the hub around if you have issues connecting."}

I loved it, integrated it Alexa, and started adding more smart switches and devices. Worked smoothly and easily... for three months.\n\nThen Samsung pushes an app update, causing it to lose my hub and all the devices attached. I didn't notice until I kept asking Alexa to turn on lights, and her polite response was basically \"I don't know what the hell you're talking about\"....\n\nSo I figure I'll have to re-link the hub and all devices to the app (oddly enough there are now two SmartThings apps on my phone, thanks Samsung...). It will be a pain, and take a lot of time, but what choice do I have? I currently have white brick connected to my network.\n\nSo I start to go through that process, only to find out I need a code that was on small piece of paper. From three months ago. Which I can't find... (I know, I should have taped the code to the hub itself. Or maybe Samsung should put the code directly on the hub instead of small, easily losable piece of paper.)\n\nSo now I have no working hub and no smart home. I can search through papers hoping to find the code, or wait for customer service to finally respond. Or I could call customers service, which is conveniently available during the hours most people are working. Either way, I give this device two stars for the three full months it worked.\n\nUPDATE: The support on Samsung's website will tell you that the welcome code is on the included card, and if you don't have it you need to contact support. I did some searching and found out the welcome code is in some cases also printed in the battery compartment. So I got my hub back online and tried to reconnect all my devices. But now for some reason it will only connect to Samsung brand devices, and despite numerous attempts will not find any of my Leviton or GE switches.\n\nUPDATE2: Still haven't heard back from Samsung Customer Service, but I finally managed to get it working again. I had to go into exclusion mode and manually go to each device and remove it. Once they were removed then the app would find them again when searching. I'll up the review to three stars, because when it's working it's great. Unfortunately the possibility of losing all my devices again worries me.\n\nUPDATE3: It worked again for about a week, then today I got the notifications that my hub wend offline, then came back online. And now all of my devices are disconnected again. I really wanted to like this hub, but I really don't like constantly reconnecting every smart device in my home. The reliability just isn't there..."}

I started with the new version of the iPhone app not realizing it was only a few months old and was a total redo of the app.\n\nIn the end I canned my original setup with the new version of the SmartThings app. The software security won\u2019t let you run a new version and classic version on the same device. The registration is a one-shot deal. You have to do a reset to get the classic app working.\nThe new version is no good right now. It does not support auto pairing for all intents and purposes. this is important because only a fraction of the available devices are listed in the menu.\n\nI messed up the reset some by not de-pairing the devices in the app prior to resetting it. If you have to backout from the SmartThings app realize it\u2019s best to do an online delete of each device then do the hub reset. Also, a local reset can be required.

I could not have been more wrong. Virtually every ZWAVE or LAN device I connected or tried to connect was an abject failure:\n\nGE Wink bulb, a very common ZWAVE product? Unsupported. Not in the list.\n\nAEON home energy monitor? Not in the list.\n\nAEON motion detectors? It managed to add them, but aside from room temp, they didn't work. No motion sensing. I tried to add a scene to turn on a light when they sensed motion? Impossible.\n\nGE ZWAVE wall switches? It added the first one. The one next to it I tried to add like 20 times. It didn't find it, even though it powered the lights so it was definitely on. Many forum users said the same - a nightmare to add.\n\nBryant LAN Thermostat? Also not on the list. No support.\n\nOh and AV support? Let's see, my Onyko NR626? No. Yamaha RX LAN receivers? No. In fact, NO receivers are supported!! Washing machines and ovens- some. Receivers, none. Really, Samsung? How many homes have their ovens on the LAN? Like NONE! Receivers- lots of homes. In fact if you bought a receiver in the past decade its probably on the LAN.\n\nI expected the VERA to be like a hobbyist hub - hard to use, and for tekkies. And I expected the Smartthings with a company worth billions behind it to be rock solid and support common products. I had it exactly backwards. The Samsung is targeted at Samsung products like Fridges and washing machines. Which no one has on his or her LAN.\n\nToday I shut off the Dumbthings , and plugged the Vera back in. I plan to reset the dumb things and sell it for a huge loss. Money well spent on the lesson I learned about corporate ZWAVE projects.\n\nOh and the ap? It has like zero config options. ANd the web interface? It said I had no hub at all (even though the AP said I did, and I signed in with the same ID). DUMB DUMB DUMB. How could the phone ap associate my hub to my email, and the web ap no? This is worse than bad.\n\nThat was like 8 hours I'll never get back. They should package this hub with their Washers and Ovens, and not offer them to consumers with a plethora of non-Samsung ZWAVE devices, like most of us.\n\nI have several TECH masters' degrees, and own/review many tech products. Usually, I rave about how great they are. In this case, I wish I'd never trusted a corporate solution. What a disappointment.\n\nWanna buy a hub?"}

Ogroski", "Date": "on June 5, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Plug & Play, and then...", "Text": "I must preface this by stating I first entered the world of Z-Wave with a Aeotec Z-Stick, using it with an older laptop, and trying various software suites (Openhab[2], HomeAssistant, Etc.). After months of off-and-on play, primarily with Openhab, I was tempted to try SmartThings as it promised a plug-and-play nature and seemed to support everything I wanted with their custom (though very confusing) development environment.\n\nUnfortunately, from the get-go, SmartThings was causing trouble. It had about half the range we had enjoyed with our Z-Stick, and thus, even with the mesh network throughout our house, couldn't reach certain nodes. Because SmartThings plugs directly into the gateway/router (no WiFi support), it has to be near your gateway, and hence, placement is very restricted... in our case, we could only relocate it to one other area, but it threw everything else out-of-whack.\n\nLooking past that, ignoring a few unreachable nodes, the interface was very...disappointing. SmartThings is designed to run in the cloud on their proprietary platform, and they only (presently) provide an app to interface with the device. Because everything is cloud-based, it requires always-available internet at your house, and has a significant delay in requests to turn things on/off. The delay alone was enough to make us think twice, but the internet requirement (even for programatic timers) was just too much after being spoiled by full local control with the Z-Stick.\n\nDeveloper-wise, they've seemingly hacked on support to write custom scripts via a web interface, but it's far too tedious to bother with for me. In the end, I just couldn't get over the cloud-based proprietary nature of their device, so we ended up sending it back.\n\nWe presently use the Z-Stick with HomeAssistant, which is pretty intuitive and entirely under local control. We have a pretty web and mobile interface (responsive design), and have it proxied through so we can access it outside of our house.\n\nIn the end, if you're ok with cloud-based proprietary control for your devices, SmartThings may be for you. If you're one who likes to be in control, and are comfortable with things like shell scripting, I'd recommend a Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5 coupled with an always-on computer at your house, or a Raspberry Pi, etc.."}

They didn\u2019t offer any further explanation. DO NOT use this for security related systems. I didn\u2019t even mention the login problems. There are 2 separate logins, 1 SmartThings, 1 Samsung. More often than not you will get messed up by logging into the wrong system. Just amateur. Forced updates with a few hours notice. I could go on. Stay away."}

Samsung prompts new users to install their \"new\" app. After much confusion and time wasted I learn I need the \"Classic\" app to control the Smart Lock. Installation and setup should have taken maybe 10 minutes, ended up taking 3 hours.\n\nThe installation process - which should be very easy - was complicated because I kept getting an error \"Device already exists\" when trying to add the hub to the SmartThings app. This was at 7:00 pm PDT on a weeknight. The Samsung website says customer service hours go until 12 am EST so I gave them a call. after drilling through their menu, I got a message saying they were closed. I tried the option of \"Live Chat\", but that turns out to be a \"bot\" that doesn't deal with the SmartThings product. Trying to find troubleshooting or manuals on the website was a total fail. Finally, after a lot of web searching I found a page showing how to do a factory reset. This fixed the problem and I was able to use the provided Welcome Code. I never would have found this page by navigating the Samsung website, only by searching the web for the particular error message (and even then not so easy).\n\nI had, as instructed, installed the \"new\" SmartThings app, which is completely useless. It could tell me whether the door was locked or not, but it would not let me lock or unlock the door within the app, much less program door codes.\n\nSo installed the Classic app (again, after much web-scouring trying to figure out what could be wrong). Classic has a better interface. Still doesn't allow you to add/delete codes. For that you need another plug-in, SmartLocks. Not that smart though, because you can't put expirations/schedules on codes. For that you need to get a developer app. I don't know how to do that because I quit there and figured I'll live with this. Another BIG issue: after you set the code for a certain person, the app will no longer display what that code is anymore! So if I forget what code I assigned to Suzie then i have to delete it and make a new one. Do I really have to write down the user codes and keep them somewhere??? Instead of store them in the app???\n\nMy Smart Lock is on a vacation rental. I want to set codes that last for each person's individual stay, plus permanent codes for housekeeper, myself, etc, plus one-time codes for plumber, painter, etc when work is being done. It doesn't seem that complex! I wonder if I would have gone with Vera or another hub if this capability would have been included.\n\nI can't speak to any of the other Smart Home device management as I just have the lock."}

The fence, which is a proximity boundary that determines when you are arriving or leaving your home, works approximately 75% of the time. It's annoying and - at the same time - a security hole because the alarm system doesn't always activate when I am away. I thought this would improve when I transitioned from my iPhone to a Samsung S7 but it did not affect the outcome. I live in the middle of Los Angeles.\n2. I received false alarms on the motion sensor frequently. When this occurs you're freaking out and waiting for a door sensor to trigger as a two-step verification but then realize that one of the - included - door sensors does not work. It's just disappointing.\n3. The outlet switch stopped working 1-year after the purchase, and then one of the door monitors died as well.\n4. The app very rarely gets updated. The app doesn't have a ton of options, you're not going to be lost in all of the things this thing can do. For example, you can't put the wall socket on a count-down timer. If a room temperature sensor reaches X, you can't turn on the wall socket to engage a fan or air conditioner. Which part of this system is smart...the sensors have been around for decades. The control system is average and there is plenty of room for improvement.\n\nBottom-line: If you're serious about home security, spend a little more money and don't buy this product. Read the 1 - 3 star reviews. I've had my system for a little over a year and I am not confident that I know what's going on at home when I am away."}

Most of these I've experienced personally, some I've not.

Developing on the Wink platform is a bit painful and the community isn't as vibrant, so I thought I'd switch. Well, step one was just trying to get it to work out of the box. Turns out I didn't get that far.\n\nI can't even describe how beyond terrible the apps are. I'm running on a Galaxy S8 (latest Samsung flagship phone) running Samsung apps on a Samsung SmartThings. You'd assume I would have the best possible experience here. There's a \"legacy\" app that doesn't seem to be able to add the hub anymore. The new method is apparently Samsung Connect. That app would get most of the way through the setup process and fail with a \"please contact support\" message. Note that the \"contact support\" message wasn't even nice enough to provide a website or contact info. Eventually I found that after I exited the app, it had installed the hub, but told me I hadn't completed the setup. The setup told me the hub was already registered to another user (me). I performed a factory reset, and did the same thing again. Try three I found out that if I just closed the app right as it was adding the hub, I could re-launch and finish the setup properly.\n\nFinally, after having the hub paired with the app, time to add my ZWave devices. Strike 1 - doesn't work with Lutron unless I buy their hub. Strike 2 - doesn't work with Nest. Strike 3 - got it paired to one of my simple smart switches, I can turn it on all day long with the app, but not off. This may not be the hub's fault - I'm not 100% sure if it had good signal strength and it was a 'generic' switch. However, the Wink hub in the same room had no issues. Strike 4 - Bali Autoview absolutely would not pair (wouldn't discover it - as a debug step I re-paired it to a Z-Wave remote and to my Wink Hub successfully, re-tried with Samsung to no avail). I don't see how it was a signal strength issue, the hub was line-of-sight in the opposite corner of the same room.\n\nSo - a few hours after opening the box, I had it half-working with one of my smart devices. The hardware experience was poor, the app experience was even worse. No thank you."}

After researching different hubs, I settled on the SmartThings hub because of the price versus what all it interfaces with. For $80, I have been exceptionally pleased.\nSetting up the hub was basically take it out of the box and plug it into the wall outlet and modem. It goes through the process of setting up on its own, after you enter your WiFi password. Be advised, mine came with a set of instructions that showed a \u2018group\u2019 of lights on the front, and explained what these lights mean. The unit I got came with only 1 light....about the size of the end of a paper clip wire. I thought it was a \u2018reset\u2019 button it was so small. After reading on the SmartThings community, I determined that this was the most current light set-up and 1 little dot is what I was looking for.\nI plugged the unit in, entered my password, entered the asked for information....and.....I waited! It took nearly half an hour to power up, go through its diagnostics, and perform endless updates. Throughout this process, however, the 1 little light did blink and change colors in accordance with the instructions. The light finally turned steady green and the hub was ready to go.\nThe App is fairly straight forward and intuitively usable. I installed two switches and 2 light bulbs in table lamps, then started adding these into routines. So far, everything I have installed has been pair able right out of the box. I have been setting up different routines in the app, just to get used to setting devices up and into usable functions, such as turning off lights for bedtime. I Am so happy with my setup that I am proceeding with my smart home project by replacing all of the switches in the house with smart switches and adding motion sensors, thermostat, and locks.\nI would STRONGLY encourage anyone reading this that is interested in setting up a SmartThings hub to READ about smart devices and what they can (and cannot) do. I admit, I was EXTREMELY pessimistic going into this project, I was definitely not expecting it to be this easy, and I was not expecting everything to be \u201cplug and play\u201d as advertised. I have been very pleased with both!\nSince I started writing this, I have installed 2 motion sensors that were NOT \u201cplug and play\u201d... they had to be \u2018finessed\u2019 in the SmartThings device handler....GET VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SMARTTHINGS COMMUNITY!!!!! I don\u2019t think there is anything that they can\u2019t walk you through and they keep it simple enough that I could follow what they were doing. Everything I have set up....works!"}

I'm just trying to use it for detecting leaks and warning me, but it's incredibly frustrating. 1) Devices will go offline with no warning. SmartThings doesn't try to fix the connection. Even after I added range extenders, the devices will just sit there offline, and not warn me when they become \"unavailable.\" This has happened to me maybe 10 times with various water leak sensors. 2) Audio notifications simply don't work. I have a Sonos connected that is supposed to play a warning in the case of a water leak. It didn't work. So I got a SmartThings alarm hoping that would fix it. Nope. It's the app. It WILL NOT play audio notifications, even though it says it will.\n\nSo I got the hub and water leak sensors to have some peace of mind. I don't go into my basement often, and I don't want a second flood. Unfortunately, Samsung can't offer real peace of mind.\n\nI really do applaud Samsung allowing any Z-Wave device. They're not closing their ecosystem, so you could, in theory, get some really cool home automation. In real life, though, it's just not there yet.

They're kinda spendy, but work great and it's really nice being able to just ask Alexa to turn on or off the lights in the morning when we wake up, go to bed or leave for work. Pairing with the hub was super easy and it works great.\n\nThen I added some Visonic MCT-340 door/window sensors to a few doors and our backyard gate and shed. Nice being able to get an alert should someone open a gate/etc while we're gone. Again, pairing with the SmartThings hub couldn't be any easier.\n\nNext up was a GogoGate2 garage door opener. Turns out the GogoGate2 only support IFTTT integration and nobody has written the necessary code for direct SmartThings integration. I'm going to blame myself for not doing my homework, but kinda makes the point that you really have to do your homework before you buy things and expect them to just work.\n\nSo I did more research and picked out the Linear GoControl garage door controller. While the GogoGate2 would require a lot of work (writing custom Groovy code) this worked out of the box and was super easy to pair with the SmartThings hub. This is pretty useful in the SmartThings app, but sadly the Alexa integration is basically non-existent which an Amazon imposed issue, not with SmartThings. Apparently, for \"security reasons\" you can't use Alexa to open or unlock doors. Oddly, you can't even ask Alexa if the garage door is open, which seems kinda stupid. Something to keep in mind!\n\nI've also integrated with our Trane XL1050 thermostat. This was a bit more work as out of the box as Trane/Nexia makes it _really_ hard to integrate with SmartThings. This is because Nexia wants to use the XL1050 as your 'smart hub' and pay Nexia a monthly service fee. Samsung on the other hand doesn't charge a monthly service fee which is why I bought it instead. Anyways, I found the necessary information to connect my XL1050 on this thread:\n\ncommunity.smartthings.com/t/how-do-you-control-a-nexia-thermostat-with-a-smartthings-hub/34046/110\n\nLast up was our Logitech Harmony remote/hub for our entertainment system. Easy peasy. Just type in your harmony username/password and it discovers all your settings.\n\nAnyways, right now I'm reading up on the SmartThings docs to write my own Device Handler and SmartApp for our HTD whole house audio controller. Obviously, this isn't for everyone, but I love the fact that SmartThings is an open and extensible platform for those of us who aren't afraid of using Github and writing some code. If you can code, then pretty much your imagination is the limit when it comes to SmartThings, but if the idea of writing code is either scary or a turn off, realize you can still do a lot of things with the SmartThings Hub, just you've got to do your homework in advance and make sure the other devices are compatible."}

{"Author": "T.J.", "Date": "on February 17, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "No Nest Support But I'm Happy I Got Smartthings.", "Text": "Comparison: After looking at the both the Wink V2 and Samsung Smartthings hub In-store and online it took me a while to make a decision, For me the biggest factor was whether or not they would work with the Devices I already had (5 Wemo Light Switches, 3 Wemo Insight Outlets, 1 Nest Thermostat and 1 Nest Fire & Carbon Monoxide Detector, 1 Ring Doorbell, 2 Sengled Bulbs, 2 Logitech Harmony Hubs, 1 Alexa, 1 Echo Dot and finally 1 Google Home) The first flaw with the smartthings is due too the rivalry of Samsung vs Google. Nest being a google company has no support with or from smartthings. The second flaw is that both have no official support for Wemo however Smartthings integration is possible with the work of smartthings Labs while with Wink there is no communication at all. Meaning while the official Smartthings team has made Wemo integration possible it is not yet official but is available to users through the lab section under the Manually add devices section in app. So too me the Smartthings seemed good but i would not be able to integrate it with nest (Without use of IFTTT) and I have already spent too much to now switch over too ecobee3. The third gripe I have only effects Wink, No harmony support whatsoever but it would work with my nest.\n\nBiggest Points:\nThings that can be Macgyvered to communicate with each other through the use of IFTTT will be marked*\nIFTTT will not allow for use of all features.\n\nWink V2: Wemo* No, Harmony* No, Nest Yes, RIng doorbell Yes (No motion alerts*).\nSmartthings: Wemo Yes (No energy info from Wemo Insight outlets), Harmony Yes, Nest* No, Ring doorbell Yes (Can create routines with motion alerts)\n\nThe Decision: In the end I decided to go with Smartthings as it would control my Wemos and Harmony hubs as well as letting me use my harmony remote to control lighting and outlets and seeing as how the Nest app is very intuitive I decided I'd much prefer using that over either Smartthings or Wink.\n\nReview: I currently have my Smartthings hub communicating directly with all my Wemo's, Harmony Hubs, Ring Doorbell and 2 Sengled Element Light Bulbs. The Communication with all of them is flawless. When someone approaches my Ring Doorbell It sends a motion alert to Smartthings\nWhich then uses the \"If things start happening\" condition to turn my Wemo light switch \"Porch\" on and then after no movement is detected for a set period of time it uses the \"If things quite down\" condition to turn of the porch light. Tested this rule 25 times with it working each time before I was satisfied. Then I paired it with my Sengled lights and it found them in seconds. When switching the non-smart switch the smart lights are on from the Off to the On position the bulbs are re-connected to the Smartthings within 3 seconds (More impressed there by the fact $10 Smart Light Bulbs can connect that fast then the ability of the hub itself). It paired to my most used harmony hub easily, only one can be paired at a time, its a technical limitation that applies to both the google home and alexa or any Harmony compatible smart hub as well. After adding my Smartthings/Samsung account login info in Google Home and both Alexa's they found all the devices paired to my Smartthings hub, I then grouped up my different devices together in the app and tested them out on all my digital assistants. They were all able to run rountins that I had set up such as \"Movie Time\" which turns off my Wemo light Switches as well as the lamps I have on the Wemo Insight outlets. I have also made a routine that turns on my Espresso machine every morning at different times depending on the day of the week using another Wemo Insight switch. I was also able to get my Nest thermostat to perform some predefined actions set in IFTTT when requested by a routine in Smartthings.\n\nFinal Word: Im Happy I Got Smartthings."}

The key ones are the use of Bluetooth communication which is limited in range, a limited number of compatible devices available, fewer configuration options, and limited use to iPhone users. For these reasons, I decided to go with a Samsung SmartThings hub using z-wave for our primary home.\n\nSamsung employs a more open architecture where a community of developers offers additional device drivers and plugin smart apps. While the Apple Home app is simple and elegant, the Samsung app is a bit cumbersome and complicated. However, Samsung makes up for it by providing far more configuration capabilities than does Apple. Also, the Samsung tech support is accessible and outstanding. I contacted their support via chat twice and got answers in minutes.

I am a tech person but could not decide which direction I wanted to go.... so that got things rolling. After a couple of months and all was working well without a hub, I stumbled across my local HD dumping a couple of WeMo smart plugs and I grabbed the two that they had to add to my collection.\n\nSo I have been operating without a hub and all was happy with the world--- until recently when iHome had server outages and firmware update glitches and since then the outlets have worked about 5% of the time and have had to be unplugged and replugged back in too many times.... needless to say a good old stand alone timer looked tempting to go back to, but I much prefer programming everything from my iPhone...so I decided to look for a hub to eliminate third party issues. Basically it came down to two: the Samsung SmartThings and Wink Hub 2....For the most part it was a tossup and the one deciding factor was that it appeared that the SmartThings hub could control the WeMo outlets whereas the Wink hub was more questionable. So I went with the SmartThings hub and it does control both brands of outlets.\n\nSetup was simple--- I already had setup my app and online account and simply plugged in the hub and the code that came with it into the app--- it took about 5-10min for the hub to update and I was ready to go. It recognized everything (including my Sonos speakers) except the iHome plugs...oh joy....then I thought about it and it appears that the iHome plugs need to have the iHome account linked--- that is fine, but it definitely makes me think about the future with other smart devices....especially the outlets...and here is why.... I want the hub to directly control the outlets...no 3rd party interference in a matter of speaking. This is how the WeMo's work for me--- yes I have their app, but, the SmartThings app and hub do not require any login information--- that is what I am after. So from here on out I have a better understanding of how I want it to work.\n\nOverall the setup is simple and one feature that I truly enjoy is being able to have my lights come on about 20-30min before sunset. From my experience is when they come on at sunset--- it is about that much too late and you have a period of time that the house is too dark... so by being able to have them come on a few minutes earlier solves everything.\n\nSo far the setup is clean and all is working well. It did report that one of my iHome plugs went rogue again and said it was offline.... sure enough when I checked the history of it, it came on and never went off. Thankfully for a 9w LED it is not a big deal to have it stuck on an extra 9-hours and after cycling the power to the smart plug all was back to working again. The layout of the app is colorful and intuitive in its overall layout as so far no instructions necessary.\n\nSize wise, the unit is small-- about 4\" square and 1\" thick. The power adapter is quite small and the small LED on the front of the unit is the perfect size and brightness....big enough to see and know what state it is in without being blinding or obtrusive. It also does use four AA batteries as backup power.\n\nIt does have geo-fencing capabilities and until I get to that point of trying it--- it is currently a dormant feature. I think that may be when I get more controlled outlets and switches that I can have things like the hallway light, kitchen light, and bedroom light all come on when I come home.... yes other lights would already be on, but this would light my path to where I have to disembark from my stuff at the end of a workday---- and with no preset time... that is pretty awesome. I will also have the other lights that I use in the morning go off earlier than programmed when I leave. This way when I go to work--- they go off when I leave. On a weekend, they stay on until the pre-programmed time.\n\nNow the search is on for some other smart devices!"}

Sure, it's an outlet connected to an extension cord, but using these bulbs allow us to control the light without needing to plug/unplug the cord each time, which is very helpful in the dark.\nWill be ordering an 8 pack of these lights soon and replace the rest of the lights throughout the house. Pretty darned cool, and will be much better once the voice controls have even more options.\nFor example, it would be great for google to know who I am by my voice (it does), and react accordingly based on that (it doesn't). This way we could name the rooms and lights, etc., as well as assign ourselves to them and say \"Hey google, turn on my bedroom light\" and it would know based on the voice, who's bedroom light to turn on. My kids could say the same thing and have their lights turn on, or we could use the kids names to turn on each of their rooms.\nYou can do some of this based on the names of the rooms, but it's not quite there when knowing what to do based on who is requesting it.\nEither way, very cool and super helpful. Can't wait to get more automation hooked up, as even with only two bulbs, we are addicted."}

Simple voice commands to turn on / turn off lights, adjust thermostats, and set timers for functions during the day or night. The hub gets it time from the web, so you don't have to reset timers every time power is lost in a storm. But I don't like the fact that it only has simple one action triggers without applying a second variable.\n\nSmartThings Hub is a very basic product and works only on a single routine command. It uses your cell phone as a presence sensor, so you can set it to adjust the thermostat down when you leave and up when you arrive. Yes it can also turn your lights on when you arrive, but you can't specify after dusk or after sunset. So consequently when you come home from work or shopping in the daytime the lights come on.\n\nNo forethought went into developing the application and allowing \"and/or\" to the triggers for the end user. I contacted tech support and was told by Kyle H. that this is simply not anything their customers would ever want. I mean really? who wants to come home at noon and have all the lights turn on, then you have to turn them off one by one.\n\nThis would be an awesome product if they would bring the capabilities of the application into the realm 21st century."}

Supports Zigbee and Z-Wave.", "Text": "When it works, it works great. The idea is cool, but it's not 100% reliable. I would say 80%. It IS emerging technology and seems to get better by the day.\n\nThe pros:\nI can turn on a crock pot, light, or thermostat remotely. It's probably paid for itself and a Z-Wave thermostat this winter. It supports Z-Wave AND Zigbee protocols which means more selection of devices. However, not every device will have a proper handler. They will either pair properly, not pair at all, or pair with limited functionality. I've found adjusting the handler in the web based back end gets a few devices to show up a generic item with basic functionality. Again, this is getting better with time, and there are constantly new devices being created by lots of different competing brands.\n\nThe cons:\nSome of the user experience in the app is poorly designed. If you have to manage multiple hubs, (home/work/shop/cottage/etc.) and have multiple users the app... I have access to a work hub with my work ST login. I set up my home hub with my personal ST login, but have to add my work account as a user to be able to access both in the app at the same time. My phone as a presence sensor only actively toggles present or away for the hub I am viewing in the app. If I show up at work and am not viewing the work hub, but then view the work hub, my presence (phone) shows up to work at some point in the day. If I forget to toggle back to home hub before I pull into the driveway, my heat won't turn on. I go to bed later, and my phone 'arrives' at 3am or so, my heat turns on and I wake up sweating.\n\nThen location starts working properly again. Then it stops working after an update, then 3 weeks later it starts working again and i get an email two days later saying my firmware was updated, etc.\n\nWhen it doesn't work as noted above, it sucks cause your lights might not work, your garage door might not open, your thermostat might not turn on or off, your security system becomes non-existent, etc.\nSupport/communication from Samsung is pretty good in the cases I've opened with them, but response time on actually getting bugs fixed is another story.\n\nAll programability is stored in the cloud, not on the device, so if your internet goes down, so does your smart home. Why does it have battery backup? If your house loses power, your router goes down, you are SOL.\n\nImprovements? Make many-many hub-user relationships sensible in the app, or support multiple logins. Add SIM card feature for backup cellular internet connectivity, add local programability, make the usb ports usable for something other than 5v power, support a wifi dongle to make it wire independent, or a 3g dongle to make it redundant in case of power outage. At least devices with battery power would still be useful."}

{"Author": "Lance P. Welsh", "Date": "on January 21, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Unreliable, poor UI.", "Text": "Update (down to one star): even worse problems, unfortunately designed this way - consider this common scenario: your set a light (or scene of lights) to turn on when a motion sensor starts, and off after motion stops, as I've done for my yard lights.\n\nI just discovered that these bright lights have been on for 10 hours because the hub missed the stop signal from the motion sensor.\n\nMissing a signal shouldn't be such a problem, but the UI only has logic to \"turn off only after receiving a stop signal\" (with an optional time extension like 10 minutes). If the stop signal is missed, the lights will stay on forever.\n\nA much more reasonable and reliable way to run this logic is \"turn these lights on with motion\" and \"leave them on for 10 minutes after the last motion start signal\".\n\nMotion sensors generate many start signals with motion but end with only one stop signal, so depending on that single stop signal is a problem.\n\nThere's so many obvious ways these common problems could be avoided, and it makes no sense that SmartThings hasn't thought of them or implemented them. For instance, these sensors could also be queried to verify the state which the hub thinks they are in.\n\nTypical engineering solutions without checking to see if they're really solving instead of creating problems. Can be solved with code, so this is a product for programmers, or users that are entertained thinking this is magic, or just very tolerant.\n\n---===---\n\nThe SmartThings app UI is poorly designed - out-of-box experience is that you have to leave the app to create an account. Yet it has to be done in the mobile browser. There is no desktop functionality, via the web or an app. The mobile app is clunky and ugly.\n\nOnce back in the app the functionality is limited. For instance, lights can only be turned on and off - not dimmed. I'd like to create a \"Movies\" scene with some dim lights, but not possible (without writing my own routines, using other apps, IFTTT). These and other common needs should've been obvious to implement.\n\nIf Samsung can't even get the simple stuff right, forget about such niceties as cloning a scene (say perhaps copy the \"Movies\" scene and tweak it for \"Dining\" without having to add and set each light from scratch again).\n\nEven if the aesthetics were nice and the functionality was good, the system is unreliable. This hub doesn't retry a light when it fails to turn. Worse yet, and inexplicably, it doesn't even report that a light failed to turn. For instance, my \"leave\" scene specifies all six lights off, and inevitably there's always one or two left on. If I don't check each light myself, they will be left on all day. It's not good enough to check the app, because sometimes the reported state isn't correct as well. Sometimes there are large delays, commands get stuck and queued-up, which makes it even more confusing.\n\nNo way this should this hub be used on anything that needs to be reliably set - I will not allow it to control my locks, garage opener, or appliances. I had these same devices on an Aeon z-wave controller which was reliable.\n\nOne more big problem - the hub should be \"centrally located\" amongst the devices it controls, but it also needs to be near the router since it's not wireless (unbelievable nowadays). Fine if your router happens to be in the center of your house, otherwise you have to choose between stringing an ethernet cable and sacrificing range (which further degrades the already poor range and reliability).\n\nAfter years of hype and development, the smart home is still generally for techies and evangelists. Too unreliable and primitive for most others. This hub doesn't change that - it's basically just a $100 useless toy.\n\nGiving this hub an extra star because it's not completely broken and does some things it says it can do. For instance, there's some useful and thoughtful utilities like the general z-wave exclusion so old devices don't have to be reset before being paired with this controller/hub."}

{"Author": "KevinB", "Date": "on January 16, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Reliability is a big issue with mine.", "Text": "First, I\u2019m an IT guy so I of course love IoT and all tech things that can make my life easier. I originally purchased several different automation devices - WeMo switches, Lifx Bulbs, Lutron Caseta, TP-Link bulbs and a bunch Insteon in wall switches as well as sensors. I eventually settled on Insteon. It was and is still extremely reliable with a broad range of products. I\u2019ve seen very few outages and it works very well with Alexa. I didn\u2019t initially land on SmartThings, because dollar for dollar for the different supported devices, Insteon was less expensive. I also didn\u2019t know enough about Z-wave or ZigBee and the numerous devices already out.\n\nRecently, I had some Somfy shades installed with Zwave integration and the main option was of course SmartThings. Unfortunately, while they can be added to ST, you need a custom device handler and they have yet to work as well as I want them to. In any case, this opened my eyes to what ST can potentially do. Through community developed apps I\u2019ve integrated my Nest, Amazon Echos, bridged my Insteon devices, Lifx and TP Link bulbs and even added my Plex server.\n\nBenefits\nSeveral different standards and integrations - Z-Wave, ZibBee, WiFI / IP devices - you\u2019re not limited to just what you see in SmartThings market place, there are many more devices.\nCommunity created integrations - There\u2019s just so many out there, it\u2019s crazy. If there\u2019s an API, somebody will write an integration for it.\n\nDrawbacks\nUnstable and un-reliable platform. Since installing the SmartThings Hub I\u2019ve had 5 major outages (not in my home) in less than 30 days for long periods. As I write this, my system is down yet again.\n\nPoor Integration within the same eco system and company - One would think that Samsung would make a better attempt to integrate their products with SmartThings. Align their roadmaps and slowly release capabilities and new features into their other products. Other than the name, they are basically separate companies. Casing point - I was going to buy a 2017 Samsung UHD TV thinking it would have some hooks to ST. No dice, only the 2016 versions had it and it was very, very limited.\n\nCommunity created integrations - while this a benefit, it is also can be a drawback in that this is not for the casual user. To implement a lot of these expanded capabilities, you need some decent technical knowledge. Very few things work well out of the box and require you to log in update say device drivers and/or apps.\n\nBlueTooth - I as well as many, many people in the ST community have been waiting for this feature to be turned on. It seems like it could be a game changer, but after several releases, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a priority for ST.\n\nBottomline - if you\u2019re comfortable and like technical challenges, go with ST. If you want a simple, reliable system then go with something like Insteon."}

{"Author": "BR from SF", "Date": "on December 21, 2017", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "way more once you introduce smart locks, thermostats", "Text": "Anyone who is interested in investing in the SmartThings ecosystem should be aware of the following:\n\n1. This \"hub\" is nothing but a set of antannae that sends/recieves information from your connected sensors/devices and forwards it on to the SmartThings cloud, where all the processing takes place. For example, say you wanted to turn on a light...so you open the SmartThings app on your phone, then press the button to turn the light on. Your phone forwards your command to the cloud where all of your devices are registered, then sends the 'on' command over the internet and down to your hub, which then broadcasts (via short range radio) the command to your device. The hub has zero functionality without the cloud whatsoever.\n\n2. The SmartThings cloud platform constantly has issues. Google \"SmartThings status\" to find their status page and look through the history of incidents. I count 30 between 1/1/18 and 4/20/18. If your just getting into SmartThings and suddenly your whole system stops working, how are you supposed to know that the cloud platform is broken and not your system? There's no documentation that tells you to go to the internet and check the platform status - you just automatically think your system broke and don't know why.\n\n3. Although this \"hub\" isn't too much money, realize that it is worthless without sensors and devices to connect with. SmartThings-branded sensors are fairly expensive and are really poorly made. Please read reviews of Samsung SmartThings Arrival Sensors, Motion Detectors, cameras etc. to get an idea of the cost and quality. Figure out for yourself what the total cost is for your particular needs. You could spend hundreds of dollars just on a few door/window sensors and a few motion detectors...way more once you introduce smart locks, thermostats, and light bulbs into your system. This reminds me of buying an ink jet printer for super cheap only to find the replacement ink cartridges costing an arm and leg.\n\n3. This is NOT a real home security system. Although there is a module in the SmartThings app called \"Smart Home Monitor\" that is what they are advertising as a security system, you must program the whole thing yourself with \"if this then do that\" type of rules. There is no out-of-the-box functionality for home security unless you buy the ADT version of the system. While simple rules can be setup using the SmartThings app, any situation that requires any type of complexity, like wait 30 seconds before setting off the alarm when a door is opened - will require you to login to the cloud and code your own routines using a Java-type language called \"Groovy.\" There is also a community-based rules engine project for the techno-savy. Even if you do just simply want an alarm to go off if a door or window is opened, YOU have to write the rules that make it happen, whether it's through the SmartThings app or using the cloud-based development environment. Of course you also have to buy a SmartThings compatible siren - - unless you just want to receive a text message when you're being burglarized.\n\n4. You don't need to - and probably shouldn't - buy SmartThings-branded sensors to work with this hub. As I said in point #1, this hub is just a pair of antanae that send/receive using the Zigbee and Z-wave protocols. These protocols are not proprietary to Samsung, so other manufacturers devices will work with this hub. You can download the SmartThings app and look in the \"Marketplace\" tab to see which devices have device handlers (drivers) that are available for this hub. For example, I would recommend Nest or Arlo cameras over the Samsung cameras, which actually, aren't even made by Samsung. I have door open/close sensors that cost half the price of SmartThings sensors and don't chew through batteries so quickly.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to anyone who is considering investing in a SmartThings system. Just keep in mind that things can get expensive really fast. I saw the hub on sale at BB and picked it up on a whim only to find it didn't do much without the add-ons. By the time I had bought the hub, 5 motion sensors, 7 door/window sensors, 2 cameras, a siren and a Phillips Hue starter kit, I had spent $1,200. Then of course you'll want to integrate it with Alexa or Google Home, so throw in a few hundred more for Echos in each room... then you'll want a compatible TV so you can change the channel with Alexa... anyways, it can become a money pit real fast.\n\nI'm giving this device 2 stars because once you spend enough $ to get all the things you'll expect from a home automation system, you'll wonder how you ever got along without it... but I'm a systems engineer and am comfortable dealing with technological challenges. Only 2 stars because this product really does seem to still be in beta testing, and I'm really bothered by how expensive the SmartThings-branded sensors/devices are given their pathetic quality."}

This allows you to automate various things in your home. You must purchase compatible items in addition to this to make it work. You also need a hardwire network outlet to plug into. This connects the hub to your home network (and therefore to your smartphone wherever you are in the world). The hub communicates with the automation devices wirelessly, so should be centrally located in your home.\n\nThis hub supports several different protocols. I have z-wave. I purchased z-wave outlets and switches, installed those, and then connected the hub using the smartphone app. In addition to being able to control lighting without having to walk to the switch, which can be very convenient when the switch for the floodlights is in the bedroom but you're outside and it's getting dark, but you can also program routines where it will turn lights on and off when you're not there to make it seem someone is there. Very useful if you're on vacation.\n\nA wide range of devices are available, including garage door openers and \"smart locks\". Personally I wouldn't want the ability to open my home remotely, but it does exist for those who do want it. I find controlling lights and the vacation lighting routines to be well worth the cost of this hub and the z-wave outlets and switches.\n\nIf you have a smart assistant, like the Google Home, you can link that to the hub also so that a simple voice command turns on lights. My favorite is to tell the assistant \"activate goodnight\" so that it will run the \"goodnight\" routine that turns everything off. No need to double-check before going to bed, just tell the assistant to run \"goodnight\"."}

Then go to Z-Wave utilities and have it join an existing network.\n\nWhen I tried adding it to my master controller, my master controller showed that it had joined, but the app kept waiting.

The type shown on This Old House was exorbitantly expensive so I checked out EcoNet, Dome, and some other valves. It seems all the cheaper valves require a hub. Amazon had the SmartThings hub on sale for $49 so I just went with it and 4 water sensors at $30 each. This hub requires an ethernet cable and an open port on your router or wireless, but is not wireless itself. Plug it into the net, plug in the power, go online to the SmartThings site, set up an account, enter the code that came with the hub, and sit back and wait. I think it took about 15 minutes until it finally said that the hub was installed.\n\nAfter that, the water sensors were brought to about 10' from the hub and the battery activated. They appeared immediately on the app on your smartphone and there or on the Samsung site you name or rename the hubs. I got a Dome auto shutoff and it was a bit more problematic to link to the hub, but pushing the button on the valve 3x as fast as you can got it linked-3 times slowly didn't do it. The Dome valve is Z-Wave and the ST water sensors are Zigbee. With this hub you don't know the difference; your online account site will tell you which is which if you want to know with actual zigbee addresses or the ZWave device number shown in a table.\n\nI've checked it out a few times by dampening a sensor and it works fine. The sensor under the washing machine got dropped once so I moved it out a bit away from all the metal and it hasn't dropped since. The metal appliances must have been weakening the signal.\n\nI don't have any plans to use it for lights or doorbells and such.

Once installed I took for granted it was working; standing sentry over my safety. WRONG!!\nI am a 71 year old man who lives alone. My neighborhood is a high crime neighborhood with many home break-ins and many shipments stolen off of the front porch.\nI set up the Hub and positioned 6 sensors, 3 for door opening and 3 motion. I place a security door bar on my bedroom door at night.\nMY PLAN: If the Samsung security system detects either a door opening or a motion, an alarm will sound on my phone, giving me time to wake up, chamber a round, assume a defensive position on the side of the bed opposite the door and call 911.\nUnfortunately, in tests, conducted recently (me walking out into the sensored area, opening doors and walking under the motion sensors) the Samsung Hub security system rarely ever activated the loud siren notification sound on my phone, thus rendering the system useless. On the phone screen the sensors clearly show they are activating based on motion or a door opening\u2026.all of them work. But audio notification is not activated.\nFor this system to be effective an audible notification MUST activate. Whether you are traveling or out to dinner or whatever, the system must get your attention. But it doesn\u2019t. Rarely does it ever sound the audio notification.\nI am very disappointed and am looking for a different system.\n\nUpdate March 26, 2018:\n\nJust got back from a 10 day trip. I regularly check SmartThings on my Samsung S7 to insure no one has entered my house and caused a motion or intrusion alert. The system still does not notify me with an audible alert, even though I have spent hours and hours re-installing, re-booting etc. During this trip I noticed 2 of the sensors showed acceptable battery power, 86% but were listed now as UNAVAILABLE!!! When I cam home yesterday, I popped the battery out and then back in and went through the drill of reintroducing it to the system. Still no audible notification EXCEPT on ONE (1) of the 6 sensors, a motion sensor, it will on occasion send my phone an audbile notification when I walk under it, but not always.\n\nThe system is dangerous!!!! Because: You count on it alerting you if there is an intruder, and even though mine is a second generation it doesn't do that except now and then on only one of the 6 sensors. ALSO at random a sensor becomes 'UNAVAILABLE' while you're gone and you CANNOT reboot it remotely.\n\nFor a security system to be effective it must be reliable, always on alert, always ready to send you an audible signal that readily gets your attention. You must be able to sleep or enter your home/apartment with the confidence that your security system is on alert and prepared to notify you 24/7.\n\nThis system is dangerous and frustrating, so last night I threw it in the trash."}

Getting this and the Echo to recognize the bulbs took a little more effort than I thought it would but it works amazing! I am able to recognize and control not only my bulbs but my satellite receiver and more. Just purchased the Harmony Hub and it worked almost out of the box. Make sure of a couple things first: Make sure that ALL of your Smart Home gadgets are on the same network, including the TV, Satellite, etc; use the app for Smart Things in order to get everything recognizable; if you are using Alexa, it will [usually] take a minute or two for things on your SmartThings to be recognized. Be patient and read the instructions. Overall, so far I highly recommend this for home automation. The further I go with automating everything, I may end up buying another!"}

I've had Wink for about 6 months now and my biggest complaint with Wink is that it is a closed system. Consequently, Wink supports a limited number of products. Wink's approach is to keep the user experience clean. Its noble, however it really limits the product. SmartThings is open, there are a ton of 3rd party supported products plus they support a ton more products in general. I did lose my NEST Thermostat capability with the SmartThings app, but I don't really need it. I've found that since I actually live in my home I'm not friggin' with the thermostat enough to bother.\n\nSmartThings is a better product. I've found the customization extremely useful and well done. It also actually (even though Wink walks you through the process nicely) has better at inclusion workflow. I like the way they leave the app in inclusion mode and you can walk around to your devices and get them connected. The automation is also better... I like the structure of the routines in SmartThings better than Robots in Wink. You can do more inside one routine and the UI is better in my opinion. The SmartThings unit itself is considerably smaller than Wink and feels a little cheaper (mechanically). SmartThings does add battery backup which is nice but you better have your network equipment on a UPS, if you don't then the batteries won't matter.\n\nI had a couple of switches that Wink always had problems maintaining a connection... this is not happening with the SmartThings hub, not sure why but its nice to have those switches back on-line."}

We use seven Echo Dots (so far) for voice automation, lists, games for the grandkids, and a Hue bridge for lights. I\u2019m looking at Harmony hubs to handle our own entertainment systems because we buy our own content. The single lesson I have learned since starting down the smart home path, is that no one device does it all well.

So far, I've installed 10 ea. Schlage Connect locks on my exterior doors, and a Sonos Connect streaming device. I've also set up an Amazon Echo Dot, so I can use voice control with all of the devices. Having added a virtual switch that I set up in IDE, I can also use the Echo to lock the doors. It's worth noting that Echo does not allow setting up locks directly, for security reasons. Therefore, I followed their lead and set up locking only, forgoing the use of voice control for unlocking. Also, for the Schlage locks, I can heartily recommend Rboy Apps for SmartThings, as their Door Lock App and Universal Lock Device Handler have made setting up the locks, including adding and deleting codes, much easier.\n\nAt this point, everything is working very well, with all devices reacting properly and reporting their status almost immediately when commands are sent."}

At this point in time the SmartThings hub has at least three huge advantages over its competitors:\n1. It has a great out of box experience where it works with a large set of tightly integrated devices with minimal setup involved typically just involving wizard flows. This includes all of the SmartThings branded accessories as well as pretty much anything on this page - https://www.smartthings.com/products.\n2. It has an amazingly active community of users and developers who build custom Device Handlers and SmartApps to greatly extend the functionality and compatibility of the SmartThings hub. Because of that, the SmartThings hub can stitch together your disparate ZigBee, Z-Wave, and Wi-Fi based devices (e.g. like the ones from TP-Link and WeMo) into a single point of control and automation.\n3. It has the support of a large company that is unlikely to go bankrupt or give up on smart home automation anytime soon. if anything, Samsung is continuing to heavily invest in smart home automation and I believe standards like ZigBee and Z-Wave have reached a sufficient level of maturity that most smart home components bought today will last for at least another decade of iterative hub controllers and compatible accessories.\n\nOverall, I love my SmartThings hub and it has truly become the center of my smart home. My only advice to you - try to purchase Z-Wave or ZigBee (in that order) devices for your home when possible. Wi-Fi based switches and other accessories from companies like TP-Link, WeMo, etc.\nmight occasionally have a shiny feature that your really like or attract you with their \"hub-less\" advertisements but they will always be dependent on the whims of network quality, unstable services, unsupported device handlers, etc. Nothing beats local execution when it comes to creating a fast and reliable smart home."}

{"Author": "DGK", "Date": "on November 11, 2017", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Worse than the Home Connect, terrible App, questionable wireless reception", "Text": "I bought this as an experiment in home automation for late 2017, specifically comparing it wink hub 2 (2016 release) and the home connect (also returned). I ended up returning it for a number of reasons.\n\nSmartThings was aquired by Samsung, who has taken the standalone hub and started down the path of uniting it with a mesh router. The Home Connect (or pro). Unfortunately, the Home Connect is a terrible router and a worse mesh router. There are serious latency issues that appear every minute or so, creating lag on voice calls that makes it untenable. The Home Connect Pro is significantly slower and less perform at than the 2011 Apple AirPort Extreme. That is a fact. Coupled with this are features that are either broken or buggy (parental control for example). So why mention the Connect Home products? Because as a SmartThings hub, they actually work quite well. I had no issues with lag or reception on any of the wireless in wall dimmers or motion sensors around the house (z wave). However as a WiFi system these had to go...\n\nSo I resolved to try the older SmartThings hub (this product). And...\n\nReception\n\nReception suddenly became an issue. Same devices, same locations for everything, including the hub and... dimmers no longer working. I purchased a plug to extend the z wave and...still not much joy. Mostly it works, but then occasionally the status is not received or the switch fails to function. If something isn\u2019t reliable then it is defective.\n\nThe app\n\nI\u2019m used to great apps and a perfect user interface. I\u2019m an iPhone user and I expect perfection in these areas. Do a search for SmartThings and you\u2019ll see a 2 or 2.5 star rating for the latest version. I found the app to be difficult to navigate and overly complicated, specifically compared to the wink app which is much MUCH better, cleaner and more professional on every level. Beyond that, inconsistent and slow status updates and a clunky overall feel, with areas that seem like duplicates and bizarre buttons all over the place. Yes it works, but it is clearly not well designed. I frankly don\u2019t understand how Samsung could release such a product, unless this is the norm.\n\nSo, this has gone back to amazon and I am sticking with the wink hub which is leaps and bounds better. Beyond that, I have also moved to Lutron Caseta dimmers as they work flawlessly and are much less cheap feeling than the leviton z wave dimmers (rebranded ge/jasco is my guess). Caseta Connect directly to the wink hub.\n\nAnother major issue is lack of WiFi on the smartthings hub. We all know that WiFi routers can\u2019t often be placed perfectly. For other wireless devices like z wave etc... the placement of the hub is critical. Higher and more central is better. Who has a cable in the center of their house? Second floor? Unlikely. The wink hub can be placed anywhere and so far has functioned flawlessly.\n\nSorry Samsung, but this product is outdated and outclassed. You\u2019ve been warned."}

I was coming from the Wink Smart hub and moved over to SmartThings when wink was purchased by i.am - his products just seem to go downhill.\n\nSo a bit about my setup - I have a few Schlage locks ( Schlage Z-Wave Connect Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt with Built-In Alarm, Works with Amazon Alexa via SmartThings, Wink or Iris, Satin Nickel, BE469 CAM 619 ) and a few Blink security cameras ( Blink Home Security Camera System for Your Smartphone with Motion Detection, HD Video, 2 Year Battery and Cloud Storage Included - 3 Camera Kit ) . I was surprised and really disappointed that SmartThings and Schlage didn't have anything built in.\n\nThen came rboyapps to the rescue. It just so happened that the 2 things I really like (my locks and camera), rboyapps makes custom device handlers and Smart apps that integrate seamlessly. I'll say that I know nothing about programming this stuff or what a device handler is or anything like that, but their site has step by step instructions. Basically you go to your Samsung account, copy and paste a few things and then it shows up in your apps. I will say that I thought about purchasing the products for a week or so because its a few dollars, but I just couldn't find anything as good and after a while was thinking something like \"I've spent 20 or 30 bucks on much dumber things - like a fake horse skeleton for halloween, but I digress, haha\".\n\nAnyway, back to the app...The apps they have created lets you remotely change codes, unlock lock, set expiring times, perform all kinds of cool actions when the lock is locked/unlocked for the lock.\n\nWith the Blink Camera smart app, I believe (like 99% sure) they worked directly with the Blink company and create some cool software to integrate DIRECTLY with your blink cameras. Arming/Disarming, watching the cameras, changing settings, etc (again - all from within smartThings).\n\nSo what I had programmed with their software was that when me or my wife locked the Schlage lock from the keypad, it would automatically ARM the blink cameras. Really cool feature, but what I found out was that after we would lock the lock and the blink cameras would ARM, we didn't have enough time to get out of the garage with the car where one of the cameras were - I wanted to have a delay between the locking of the lock and the arming of the blink camera. So....\n\nI contacted them with their support email asking them about the feature or a way it could be done. Maddie responded within 10 minutes walking me through a couple other questions I had and then indicated that it was not possible but would mark it as a future feature for the developers. That was 2 days ago.\n\nMaddie sent me an email today indicating that this new feature is now in the smart app and all I had to do was follow the step by step instructions for an update. It works flawlessly and me and my wife are really excited. More so me, because I set all this stuff up and she was getting annoyed with all the technology, but she is really coming around.\n\nSo now, we can lock the Schlage lock, have the lock app automatically wait a number of minutes I tell it to and then arm the blink cameras. Gives us enough time to get out of the garage.\n\nI know I may sound like a paid shill or whatever and they didn't give me any discounts or any free stuff. I paid full price for the software, but their team works really hard and is super responsive, and I really appreciate that, I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nIf you have blink cameras or schlage locks, or both (like me), don't spend hours upon hours searching for something awesome and free - it doesn't exist - I tried. I don't work for them, but if you have any questions about my setup with or without their stuff, I can answer.\n\nThanks,\nMatt"}

Craftmsan garage door opener is no longer supported, for the Ring doorbell, you can only view the battery status, although motion notifications can be set, they are very delayed. Also, you can't view live video or respond to a doorbell from the ST app, you have to use the native Ring app. The work arounds for all this either require you to code apps or find one that someone has done and load it, which I haven't taken the time to figure out yet.\n\nI haven't changed out anything related to lighting or added security to my home yet, but I guess when I do that, this will be more useful."}

The typical response logged on the forums is, \"Uh, we don't see anything on our end going wrong...\" Considering how long this has be going on, that's just Samsung's nice way of saying, \"I got your money. So just shut up and go away. We can't be bothered with you customers.\"\n\nAs of now, I've had to unplug my device to be able to sleep through the night without this damn thing turning my lights on randomly.

We finally bought a house and I thought I'd take a step up from our Hue-only setup we'd been using in our rental for a few years. Here's what I bought:\n\nSamsung SmartThings hub, three z-wave dimmers, two z-wave switches, and a Honeywell WiFi\n\nInitial setup: The software was glitchy and it took multiple attempts to sign in to my previously-existing Samsung account. Multiple user setup is also not very clear.\n\nDevice setup: Z-Wave linkage wasn't difficult. Sometimes it takes a dimmer one or two tries to pair with the hub.\n\nLinking other hubs: Linking the Philips Hue hub took a couple of tries. The status of the Hue devices does not properly reflect on the list of devices under the Samsung SmartThings app \"My Home\" tab.\n\nControlling individual lights or rooms: Just awful implementation, Samsung! It takes multiple steps to get to any one device to adjust it. You have to go to \"My Home,\" then select either the \"Things\" or \"Rooms\" tab, and then toggle the device. But what if you need to dim a light? You need to select the device, then tap the percentage icon (which is not intuitive at all), and then select the brightness. It's a COMPLETELY wacky and laborious way to set the brightness of any of your devices. Want to dim an entire room? Nope. Not possible in the app. This is easily doable and completely intuitive with other systems like Philips Hue, by contrast.\n\nHub independence: Certain features work and other features don't work if you're absent an internet connection. At least with Philips Hue, you can go into the official app or Huemote and change device brightness if you're on the WLAN. But, with SmartThings, it's not so smart! If you don't have an internet connection, the app itself refuses to work. Nevermind the fact you're on the same WLAN and have a solid connection between your phone/computer and the router (and hence, the SmartThings hub), it just doesn't work. Automated routines will work (like if you have a Z-Wave switch set up to trigger multiple lights, or if you have a sensor set up), but the app just refuses to work. It's incredibly frustrating. What's the point of having a local system if it relies on an internet connection for basic functionality? Plus, the hub has two AA batteries in it as a backup... I have no idea what the batteries do since your lights wouldn't work anyway in the case of a power outage.\n\nLatency: Slow. I find the Samsung SmartThings system to be flat out slow compared to Philips Hue. And since my Hue system is now linked through the SmartThings hub, everything I do with the Hue lights is now slow too.\n\nWidgets: Great concept, I just wish it were easier to get to them in iOS 11. Lots of swiping involved. This is more of a criticism of Apple, but I wish you could put widgets on your home screen like you can with many Android applications.\n\nAlexa: Because Samsung's SmartThings app is such a pile of trash, we rely mostly on our three Amazon Echo Dots in the house to control the lights. The downside to this is that you need to configure each room separately in your Alexa app on your phone. This means anytime you change room/device configuration in the SmartThings app, you'll need to reconfigure Alexa in your Alexa app as well. Once it's up and running, it's effective. We have rooms set up for \"downstairs,\" \"kitchen,\" \"bedroom,\" and \"office,\" and Alexa responds well. Still, not all of the lights turn on/off or dim at the same time, but perhaps that's just a limitation of the Z-Wave protocol.\n\nOverall, I'm not very impressed with what SHOULD be a polished, fantastic product. How does Philips, a much smaller company, do it so much better? In the interim, I'll keep using SmartThings, but I really have reservations recommending it to anyone due to how lousy the software is."}

However, the automation routines still need a lot more works (customization) for the hub to be great device.\n\nFor one thing, the automation routines allow many customization rules to be configured. However, the rules fall short of one very simple logic and that is the duration of the \"on\" state for a device. For example, you can create an automation routine for disarming the alarm and turning on a light when someone arrives between 7PM and 10PM at night, but you cannot configure the light to stay on for a certain amount of time before the routine turns the light off. If I only want the light the be on for 5 minutes when I arrive, I cannot create a routine for this. You can only create a routine for turning things on and turning things off, but you cannot create a routine for turning things on for a certain amount of time. Some people may ask why don't I just create a routing to turn off the light? My answer would be \"yes, I could!\" but since I don't know what time I'll be arriving, I can't create a routine to turn the light off if I don't know what time the time will be turned on.\n\nThere are other simple and logical settings that are totally missing from the configurations. This is not a hard fix, so hopefully someone with a common sense would fix it in the next software update."}

Otherwise it never sees it.) The smartthings app on android is also very handy. It has widgets you can add to your home screen to perform various routines, and you can also setup your phone as a presence sensor and create routines based on it's presence. In my case, I use it to unlock my front door and turn on the living room light as soon as my phone is detected by the hub. The only flaw with this routine, is it runs the routine if I reboot my phone while within range of the hub, so I have to remember to lock it back again when I reboot.

The app doesn't alert you that the hub is offline either which isn't ok.\n3) Some of the automations have just stopped running and the only way to get them to start running again was to go in and re-save them.\nThese have made this experience of using this frustrating and you can't rely on things to work. You shouldn't have to go in every day and check the application logs to make sure it's all working properly."}

I hope they get their stuff together. I won't replace SmartThings until I can get another Z-Wave hub in place, for now, it's staying here but not for long."}

The door opener still has issues but that is not an function of the Smartthings its because that device was poorly built.\n\nDiscovery: It discovered all my Hue Bridge devices almost immediatly after I plugged the unit in (I had to do a little more than that but it was that simple).\n\nApp: The app is decent, I would like a nice browser interface but I can live with the app. It works as needed and is simple for most users.\n\nAutomation: It needs a little work in the Scene/automation section while I can create Automation schedules I would like a bit more control over complicated scheduling, but that is why I have the other controller.\n\nThe one thing I really like is that even though it wont discover some older Z-wave devices I have (neither did my Fibaro), my Vera can see them, and I can group the Devices from the Vera and the Fibaro together and control them from the Hub.

After returning home several trips ago to find water on the floor from a broken refrigerator ice maker line, I decided to install some leak detectors so I could monitor any water leaks. Two weeks of having a professional service dry my hardwood floors was enough motivation. I had already set-up Arlo home security cameras and Nest smoke detectors for web-based monitoring. So doing the same with leak detectors made sense.\n\nAfter researching leak detectors, I decided on the ones offered by SmartThings. I liked the small size and the fact there were no wires or electric plugs involved. I installed them and was very happy with how they worked, though it did take some tinkering.\n\nThen I discovered a serious limitation. Samsung SmartThings does NOT provide a web-monitoring portal, like I'm used to with Arlo or Nest. Instead, I am forced to monitor only through my Android phone. This isn't a problem except when I am traveling internationally where I use a local throwaway phone. Of course, that's why I got the detectors to start with, because of my travel. Not being able to monitor by web internationally is a problem.. If I had known, I would have kept looking.\n\nI confirmed this \"no web-based monitoring\" limitation with Samsung SmartThings customer support. That's correct-no web-based monitoring, they said, but web-based monitoring is not common for home device monitoring (I'm always uplifted to have a company tell me that my needs are not legitimate in order to justify a problematic product design). But I have Arlo and Nest, I said, both of which provide web-based monitoring. True, they said, but they are not complete smart home solutions. (So what? I'm thinking) According to the rep, there are no plans by Samsung SmartThings to provide web-based monitoring.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't research well enough to uncover this limitation. I'm posting this review just in case it helps someone else avoid a similar mistake."}

Recording for 10 seconds isn't useful and therefore I'm no longer using SmartThings as I'd hoped. Maybe it works well for other things but this was one of the \"out of the box\" products that it claims to work with and not doing so was a deal breaker for my needs. Also as an FYI, it still requires you to keep all the hubs and product specific accounts to use the SmartThings hub, so it doesn't replace all of that, rather it just \"controls\" the devices with which it's compatible. I didn't know this and while not a terrible thing, wanted to mention for others to know in advance. Hope this helps."}

My wife and I live in a large three-story townhome. I have 2 Wi-Fi (802.11 n/ac) access points \u2013 one that came with my Verizon FiOS in the basement and a TP-Link Archer C9 in a bedroom on the top floor. I have an Echo on the middle floor and an Echo Dot in the basement and on the top floor. The \u201cHub\u201d is connected to a wired Ethernet local area network.\nI am in the process of replacing an ancient (predates the dinosaurs) homegrown Elk security system that has no chance of incorporating home automation. I decided to dive headlong into security/automation products. I wanted a complete all-in-one answer rather than one system for security and one system for automation. I also wanted Alexa and IFTTT integration. Enter the \u201cHub\u201d. Perfect.\nTo test the system before replacing all the old security sensors, I purchased several products \u2013 all Z-Wave Plus: Leviton Switch DZ15S, Leviton Dimmer DZ6HD, Leviton Plug-In Outlet DZPA1, Ecolink Motion Sensor with Pet Immunity PIR-ZWAVE2.5-ECO, Ecolink Door/Window Sensor DW-ZWAVE2.5. The Ecolink Door/Window sensors are large. I actually tried several other smaller sensors to no avail.\nEvery one of the devices connected with absolutely no issues.\nThe \u201cHub\u201d software and the integration with Alexa are working perfectly. I have geo-fencing set up so that when either my Android phone or my wife\u2019s iPhone leave the house or return, the system sends both a text and push notification. I can turn on all the lights when I park the car in front of the house. My front porch lights go on at sunset and off at sunrise \u2013 simple setup using the Smart Lights capability. When my wife walks upstairs to the bedroom, a simple \u201cAlexa, turn on the bedroom light\u201d and the light is on. I have not yet tried to set up scenes or rooms but I suspect that will be easy.\nReady for this? There are two apps on the Windows 10 Store \u2013 Home Remote and SmartThings To Start \u2013 that give you access to the devices while sitting at a PC. The SmartThings app on Android, the iPhone and iPad is very easy with a simple interface. You can even put your favorites on the lock screen.\nThe SmartThings app development is open-source. That means you can code your own apps if you are so inclined to try it. To code a smart app you use a derivative of the Java programming language name Groovy (and yes, Groovy is groovy, an easier and more concise language than Java but runs in a Java Virtual Machine).\nThere is also IFTTT if you want to code various actions based on events.\nSo, only a month into my testing, no problems. I am constantly opening and closing doors and windows, walking by the motion detector and giving Alexa a workout turning lights on and off or changing the dimming.\nThe Ecolink devices use the CR123A battery and all devices after a month still show 100%. The Ecolink devices report their battery level to the \u201cHub\u201d.\nMy house is well covered by two Wi-Fi access points. The Z-Wave Plus devices act in a mesh network and so far no problem with devices not being detected. I would strongly recommend going with Z-Wave Plus devices as the coverage is better with less power draw than the original Z-Wave.\nFor those adventurous souls, there are several tutorials online about coding a SmartThings app using Groovy. One sample has you code an app to turn on a light if motion is detected.\nBy the way, some window/door sensors (the Fibaro and Nortek GoControl for example), are not detected as a window/door sensor but rather as a switch. They report an activity when an event happens (open or close) but do not show the current status (open or closed).\nAnd now for the security part. SmartThings has paired with Scout Alarm for professional monitoring. This solves my requirement for one system to handle security and home automation. There is no additional hardware nor contract required to utilize Scout. You can pay my month or yearly at a discount.\nI expect to continue testing for several more months before I undertake a complete removal of the old security hardware. I will update this review as my testing proceeds.\nAll in all, Groovy!"}

{"Author": "A. Magill", "Date": "on July 13, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Miserable", "Text": "I was disappointed. Looking into this beforehand, it seemed aimed directly at my nerdy engineer heart. It's programmable with a well-documented language and API, it supports loads of third-party devices, and it's supposed to have enough of its own brains to work mostly independent of the cloud. I couldn't wait to start getting stuff hooked up to it.\n\nOnce I had it in hand, though, I was almost immediately frustrated and disappointed.\n\nActually getting devices to pair with it was a strangely major struggle. Following the normal instructions (didn't work), then the troubleshooting instructions (didn't work), then suggestions from around the internet, actually getting a device to pair took around an hour. This happened with all three devices I got (a dimmer plug, a dimmer switch, and a deadbolt, all different brands). Even then, communication was unreliable, had poor range, and often took several seconds to respond. At one point, I had somehow apparently paired a device twice at once- before it wasn't connected at all, and then suddenly there were two entries for it. Now they also make it surprisingly annoying to un-pair a device- you have to get the device to request that it be un-paired. But that only made my duplicate pairing situation worse, not better- it removed the working pairing, but left behind the one that didn't. So I had a device listed in the app with no apparent way of removing it. I finally found out if I go through a certain web site, there are advanced controls to just delete a device, and that fixed it.\n\nI found the Android app to be pretty annoying, the web site kind of terrible, and the Windows application that's advertised on the product page simply does not exist.\n\nAnother thing I was unhappy about was that it's absolutely dependent on the Cloud to function. Not even just for weather updates or for communicating with you from outside the house or that kind of thing, but for everything. Even if you write your own programs to control your devices, sometimes they might run locally on the hub, sometimes they might run on Samsung's servers and tell the hub what to do. There's no way to know or control that decision. So if you lose internet access, maybe your light switch stops working too.\n\nI've seen IoT-type devices done right. It's rare, but it happens. My RainMachine sprinkler timer, for example, is just about a perfect example of getting the technical details right. With this is looks like the developers set out with some great ideas, but then something went terribly wrong with the implementation. I have literally myself programmed electronic devices to be able to discover and communicate with each other wirelessly, and I'm baffled by how poorly the SmartThings hub does it. I've returned all of my Z-wave stuff."}

The recent addition of Scenes to ST only brings it up to the level of other hubs like Vera. I dumped my expensive Vera hub directly for the reason of lack of a Rules Based Engine solution. The whole purpose of automation is that I don't have to be the brain to drive the system (push a button). I want a system that will look at the environment and on specific events (i.e. motion sensor = active then open multiple vents and turn on Fans & A/C, else close the vents and turn off the fans & A/C) and make decisions without further interaction on my part.\n\nScenes and routines require for me to decide it time for an action and press a button to make it work.

It was absolutely worthless with the Schlage Z Wave connect lock and I may as well have not purchased it at all, I had the same minimal functionality - to lock and unlock. For my other systems it was not as capable as the apps I already my phone that are connected to my wifi. We spent 4 hours trying to figure out how to do a developer app and finally just gave up.

It's supposed to do that, the app has an automation section and I've programmed the thermostat and front door lock to change settings on schedule. It does change them ---- sometimes. Several times I've checked the front door after it's supposed to have locked and it wasn't locked. The morning heat setting has been missed on occasion and I've had to turn the heat on myself. Likewise with the Good Night heat setting. I've had to lower the heat manually. Most of the time it seems to work, but I'd guess that 10% of the time it doesn't.\n\nI bought this set up instead of a programmable thermostat. The programmable thermostat I had in my last house never failed. This one fails 10% of the time.\n\nI don't know if the Hub sends a signal and it's ignored or if it misses sending a signal, but either way, sometimes the program settings don't happen.\n\nIt is easy to set up or I'd rate it lower. But, it needs a way of checking to make sure the programmed changes take place. Now I'll worry when I leave on vacation about whether it will work."}

As others have found, the activation code just did not work, failing time and again. Only after a hard rest could I get it to fire up. While I was happy to persevere, I'm not sure everyone would be as patient and would simply return for the refund. Samsung need to review this.\n\nIf you're dipping your toe into smart home technology, this hub is a good starting point.

People will sometimes give a poor review to some piece of equipment or software stating \"it didn't work correctly,\" often without realizing \"operator failure\" to be the cause. That said...since this product has such mixed reviews, I decided to test it out primarily because of its ability to integrate with Amazon Alexa, Harmony Smart Hub, Schlage Keyless Entry, Linear Garage Doors and most importantly all of the Z-Wave outlets and switches throughout my home. The basic hub setup was relatively painless except for having to \"unpair\" each of the above items from the existing Z-Wave controller in order to then pair it with the SmartThings Hub. Once that tedious task is complete then you must set up each of your automations not only on the ST Hub but also with any controllers such as Alexa and Harmony. Depending on how many products you have to pair, this process can be fairly labor intensive. Once I completed the pairing processing it was time to set \"automations\". Here's where my issues began. Paired items either wouldn't operate or operated intermittently. My AV equipment and TV would turn on every morning between 10:45 am and 11 am. When requesting that Alexa perform certain functions she'd attempt to perform the action, however the item or items did not respond to her commands. After a week of unnecessary frustration, I was ready to return the Hub until I saw there was a \"major update\" on the horizon. I decided to hold off on returning the equipment until after the update in the event there was some \"WOW Factor\" improvements. Well folks, I'll close this review by saying, the only WOW factor with this product for me is \"WOW I can't believe I bought it!\""}

CONS FIRST: This device is not yet ready for market and every item purchased which is listed as compatible on the app have not worked as advertised. EXAMPLES 1. None of the battery powered wall mounted dimming switches will actually adjust light brightness. On and off is the only option from the wall switch. Dimming can only be done with the phone app. 2. SONOS owners beware-every time you use the app to search for a new device (thing), your SONOS speakers are hijacked and their operation from your SONOS controller is compromised. Even after you remove the SONSO speakers (1 at a time) from the app they are wonky for a a few hours. Samsung phone tech support says this is a known issue with no fix in the pipeline. 3. Tech support relies heavily on the online user groups for help. They even sent me there because they had no answer. This is fine if you want SMARTTHINGS as a hobby. Geek out if you want. If you want an easily installed, stable and reliable smarthome system, this is not for you. Bear in mind, I am a bit of a geek, but when it comes to something the rest of the family has to use, I want it to be simple and bullet proof. SMARTHINGS is neither. 4. SAMSUNG's compatibility list is outright false advertising. 5. If your idea of a smarthome is controlling everything with the SMARTHINGS app, you may be fairly satisfied with this device. If you want wall switches and remotes to also control your home (you know, walk into a room and use a dimmer on the wall to control lights like cavemen did) this thing stinks. 6. Do not use Amazon's frequently-bought-together guidelines for compatability. Even SAMSUNG tech support said that is giving them headaches. PRO LAST: 1. Very attractive 2. Built in battery backup 3. Small footprint. 4. No range issues in a 4,000 3 floor home 5. No port forwarding required yet 6. Easy initial installation except for the SONOS problem. Devices (things as samsung calls them) install easily (but many advertised features are simply not available. There are cheats for this on the message boards sometimes, but that's a pain in the butt). TO CONCLUDE: I had high hopes for this device, which are in the crapper. I am so close to returning it and all devices I have bought for it. The only thing stopping me is the huge amount of time I have into troubleshooting. SAMSUNG tech support even sent me a $50 Amazon gift card for all my troubles. Their phone log for me goes on for hours. I know networks and tech better than most and I am very frustrated. I would not buy it again and I obviously do not recommend this product."}

{"Author": "Rodney McKay", "Date": "on May 19, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Painfully unreliable with Alexa", "Text": "Actually, it's not that I don't like SmartThings (or Alexa/Echo), is just that the two of them are an extremely frustrating combination. The problem is, the Alexa app's \"Discover Devices\" way too often fails to work with devices that are registered (and working perfectly) with SmartThings. If you search online, you'll find all sorts of \"tricks\" for getting around this well-known problem, mostly involving removing the devices from SmartThings, reinstalling them, and then running Alexa's Discover Devices again. Doesn't work.\n\nThis came up for me again recently because I wanted to rename a light switch that had been working fine with SmartThings and Alexa. So, following the directions, I removed the device from Alexa's list, renamed it in SmartThings, and tried to get Alexa to re-Discover it. No go! I also tried removing it in SmartThings and reinstalling it in both, and that didn't work either. I've been working on it for a week now, and am tearing my hair out with frustration.\n\nSo, I would say that using Alexa and SmartThings together is something to take on only if you have an unusual amount of patience and significant technical savvy. And by the way, it's also well known that this is a problem with SmartThings rather than with Alexa's Discover Devices. So, if you're addicted to Alexa (I am!), you might want to consider a home control solution other than SmartThings.\n\nEdit, May 29, 2017:\n\nAfter a week of useless discussions with SmartThings tech support, and many more hours of wasted time, I have given up and switched to using a Wink Hub 2. So far, it has NONE of the problems that I've been having with SmartThings. It is very easy to add devices to Wink, and they quickly & easily appear in the Alexa app when I run the device discovery. Why can't SmartThings fix this absurd problem that so many users are having?! As it is, Alexa and Wink are a wonderful combination, but SmartThings with Alexa is a very masochistic experience.\n\nThe one problem I can see with Wink compared to SmartThings is that the Wink hub does not have battery backup. This is a really bad decision on the part of the Wink developers (especially since Wink doesn't always reset itself correctly after a power failure), but a simple workaround is to plug the hub into an inexpensive uninterruptable power supply (UPS). The hub draws very little power, so even the smallest UPS can keep it running for a long time.\n\nI'll edit again if the SmartThings problems get fixed (I'm not holding my breath...) or if I run into trouble with Wink, but so far I'm a very happy camper with Wink and Alexa.\n\nFor all the time I've wasted on SmartThings, I could have manually operated the devices I'm trying to use with it thousands of times. What's the point of home automation if it costs you far more time & effort (and money...) than it saves?"}

I bought 5 years ago an entire Insteon but never implemented it so I sold it all off on ebay. It was one of the premier systems but closed in terms of standards they supported at the time. Then about 2 Years ago I got the Samsung SmarThings hub to do 2 things\n1) Create a garage door opener that I can control from my iPhone\n2) Install and control Schlage Connect BE468 Touchscreen Deadbolt At Schlage smart lock\nI created a kludge for garage door opener based upon HSM200 and I posted in the SmartThings forum how I got all that to work\n\nI did not want to pay any subscription fees. I also liked that SmartThings worked with all standards such as z-wave and zigbee. So that is what I liked about the SmartThings platform and the Schlage lock and garage door \"hack\" I put together. Now to enhance the Schlage smart lock I bought a few \"Smartapps\" from rboy (google \" rboy apps SmartThings\" as amazon won't let me put the link here) These have been a godsend. For a small one-time fee (I think $35 - I can't remember but this gets me lifetime access to all of the apps here) I got this app\nUser Unlock/Lock Door Notifications and Actions\nwhich sends me texts and let me know which code was used to unlock my door, I also get a notification and history in my app.\n\nAnd just this past week I worked their support to figure out a minor issue that annoyed me. In summary my smart lock was sending a note every minute that the \"Code 1 is Not Set\" \"Code 3 Is Not Set\" etc. I suspected this was draining my batteries in my smart lock.\nThe support from rboy apps had me install a new \"device handler\" for my smart lock vs. the generic one. Think of a device handler as software driver for the smart lock. This was very easy to do and it solved my issue of the notifications occurring every minute and battery drain has been greatly reduced. I also got some new nifty features such as disable the keypad from my phone (also known as vacation mode).\nFYI I changed from \u201cZ-Wave Lock\u201d to \"Enhanced z wave Handler\u201d for the device handler. Instructions for this are very clear on rboy's site.\n\nThe only thing out of the ordinary is that you can't just install these enhanced smartapps from your phone, you need to create an account on the SmartThings ide webpage (google \"SmartThings ide\") and on this web page install the\napp. It is not hard at all.\n\nOverall I'm very happy, I also bought a few switches that allows me to turn on a fan while I'm cycling indoors from my phone. I tried to put in smartphone enabled lights from GE but my house did not have a neutral wire to allow this (my house is 30 years old).\n\nI also can control my sonos which may seem pointless but if am away I can put music on to look like I am home.\nI also bought as GE smartbulb and when I go away I turn that lamp on with this bulb and then schedule the light to turn on and off at various times to make it look like I am home."}

{"Author": "M. Shulman", "Date": "on May 10, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great product at a great price!", "Text": "Having just moved into a new home, I was looking at putting in some sort of DIY alarm system. I paid far more then I'd like to think about using ADP in our last place. I looked at other competitors and ultimately decided on this due to it supporting a lot more devices then the competition.\n\nI've had it up and running for 2 weeks and it's been great. I have over 20 devices monitored and so far it was worked flawlessly. Another big plus for me was that they have a windows phone app. Using a windows phone, this has been great. My only complaint about that is that the app isn't consistent with the android app (I also have a couple android devices). I can do all the same things, but how you get to some things varies a bit.\n\nWhile I gave it 5 stars, because I do love it, there are some things that a casual user might find more frustrating. A number of newer sensors and zwave devices don't work with it out of the box. But there is a great community behind smartthings and every device I've purchased that didn't work out of the box is working with it. You just need to manually install a custom device handler for these devices - do a search and you will easily find plenty of info on this and it isn't that difficult to do. There's also a lot of smartapps and it seems people are always working on more. I know over time, this will just keep getting better.\n\nSo if you are looking for a DIY system that can not only provide alarm type features (siren, door/windows sensors and motion sensors and alerting via the app or even via text message) but also home automation features such as turning on lights when you enter a room, or turning them off after a certain time..etc. Then this is a great device! I've even used smart switches on our outside lights to turn them on at sunset and off at a specific time. Much more flexible then a standard timer!\n\nIn summary: I'd highly recommend it! With one caveat - If you don't have a neutral wire in your light switches, you will NOT be able to use smart switches - but there's plenty of work around's for this."}

Well It could not have been one without this Smartthings hub. It's essentially the intermediary between your devices and Alexa. Sure theres a lot of devices now that says works with Alexa and such, but having this hub can run all the devices through it, and then Alexa. It enables you to create rooms with ALL the different devices even from different companies, and make them work together. This enables you to incorporate many diifferent products and control them from one place. I have at least 8 ifferent brands of product running through this hub, and It. also. works well integrated with IFTTT. You can also create your own automations through this hub, like I have the lights turn on in the morning to wake me up. It even recognizes Belkin WeeMo Smart Bulbs when the weemo app won't. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to start a smarthome because it is so versatile. It's easy for beginners because of the interface, an that you can control most all of your devices that are wifi, z-wave, or Zigbee thst are within range. Most products mention whether or not they work with this hub, and most do. I think I have over 100 devices going through SmartThings now, and Alexa Integrates right with Smartthings so you can use your voice to control everything. Sometimes it even finds devices for you. I included a few pics of the interface on the app on my Iphone7. I would highly recommend getting one for your smarthome, so you can bring everything together. It's the best hub on the market in my opinion right now."}

There is no \"figuring this out\". It's buggy and has many known issues. I've had this hub since it was released.\n\nIf you have 5-10 devices, you're fine. You probably won't see most of the issues I've been dealing with. It's when you replace all your home light switches, garage doors, and dead bolts that you see the many issues.\n\nI have 153 devices on my z-wave network. WELL under the 240 that this system is advertised to support. None the less, SmartThings support continues to blame \"Z-wave network traffic\" as the culprit.\n\nThe issues include:\n- Devises no longer responding to commands from the app.\n- Light switches just reverse direction (down makes the light turn on, up makes the light turn off)\n- Blue LED notifications just flip (Set to glow when the light is on, but glows when the light is off)\n- Randomly, triggers such as outside lights will work and will not work\n- System will just NOT respond to a light on/off command or be delayed 30+ seconds.\n\nThese issues aren't few and far between. They are a daily occurrence. When a random switch stops working with the app you have to remove it from the hub and add it back in. This sounds easy but it's flaky and frustrating like the rest of this system. Sometimes you can remove it, sometimes you have to spend 10 minutes unregistering it 5+ times. To makes matters worse, it randomly will unregister other switches instead, exacerbating the problem.\n\nThen you need to add it. This is another frustrating 10+ minute project. It will add the switch incorrectly (which means you need to remove it and add it again), it'll actually have not unregistered it (despite telling you it did) so you have to go back in and unregister it again, or it'll just not find it.\n\nI love the possibilities of this system and what it can do. These problems completely kill the experience. There is no fix for these problems. I had them in hub 1 and continue to have them in hub 2. Support is worthless as they give you the same canned response. \"Pull the power toggle on the switch\", \"Power cycle the hub\", \"Remove the device and readd it\". If you only want 10 or so smart devices, get this! If not prepare to be unbelievably irritated."}

The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because setting up smart routines is not as simple or intuitive as it could be. I also have trouble getting the hub to recognize when my wife and my phones arrive and leave. At least I don't think it does. When I look at the history I can often see them leaving but not arriving. How does it know it left if it doesn't show me that it arrived prior to that. It could just be a quirk in the app. I don't feel like I can depend on smart routines that depend on the phones leaving or arriving because of that.\n\nI also wish they had a desktop app for controlling the hub and devices. There are some things that would just be much easier configuring on a larg screen instead of on a phone screen.\n\nI have no complaints about reliability or up-time. I also have almost no trouble with coverage. I did have an issue setting up connected Cree bulbs outside of the house. I had to get the hub to recognize them inside the house because it couldn't detect them outside. Then I moved them outside and they are controlled with a smart routine or through Alexa with no problems. Weird that you can't set them up outside but there is no problem controlling them. I guess it is the brick walls causing the problem because they are no further from my hub than other devices in the house.\n\nI had some issues re-syncing the devices when I moved into a new house but eventually was able to work those issues out by removing the skill from Alexa and adding it back in. Until I did that, Alexa had all of my old device names showing as offline as well as all of my new device names. It was mostly annoying and I don't know if that could be considered any SmartThings problem or not.\n\nI have been able to connect every device that SmartThings said it would connect. I had trouble getting a connected switch to work again after I moved it but after I quit trying to remove it from ST and just renamed it instead, everything was good."}

I have had problems connecting with it when I have spotty cell phone service, but that is to be expected. Also, it does need to be within a reasonable proximity of the switches and outlets that it is controlling. I did have problems with connecting to a switch after the initial set up, but they were resolved when I moved the hub closer.\n\nThe options for interfacing with the Honeywell thermostats leave much to be desired. It seems like you can't change the schedule or make temporary temperature changes on the thermostat, but only permanent temperature changes. I only use the Honeywell app for adjusting my thermostats.\n\nThe biggest complaint that I have with this hub is that it loses connectivity several times per day. It seems to regain connectivity right away, but when it loses it, it causes a rapid flashing blue light on my phone which is annoying to see flash during the night. I have tried moving it in different places along with the router it is connected to, but this issue doesn't go away.\n\n**EDIT: After speaking with a rep from Smartthings, I have learned the connectivity issue that I've been having is with the Honeywell connectivity. It is still a Smartthings issue and not a Honeywell issue and they are supposed to be working on a fix for it. I will update my review accordingly once the fix has been applied."}

The hub communicates with \"Z-Wave\" which is a very common communication between automation devices. Z-Wave is the only maker I have found for 3-way light switches. The hub will control many other devices such as bulbs, locks, switches, dimmers, sensors and more. I control the device through an app on my phone.\n\nPros: Works with universal Z-Wave technology. It can control 50+different devices. If placed in a central location has good range for my bedrooms. Takes only one TCPIP address. Other type of devices each take an address and communicate individually on the internet. Works both with Google and Amazon. Devices purchased for this hub cost generally less than those that talk directly to the internet. My guess they are simpler. The service that talks to Amazon and Google is free. Some have additional charges. This does not.\n\nCons: It will only control \"Z-wave\" compatible devices. I haven't found this much of a problem as more devices are being released all the time. Devices using this hub have limited intelligence. All the smarts is in the hub and the App from Samsung. Although the app is good, it does have some limitations. I have not found many."}

Having been an early adopter of the Wink system, I was OK with the Wink Hub itself but always a bit disappointed with the Wink mobile app with respect to it being very basic/limited (in fact, while many of my home automation devices are connected to my network via my Wink Hub, I most always use the mobile apps from the manufacturers of the various home automation devices instead of using the Wink mobile app - especially the Honeywell Thermostat mobile app, as its 10x better than the Wink interface). In addition, or so I thought, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of devices available/compatible with my Wink Hub. As Wink recently rolled out its next-gen hub, I did a little research about the current other available hubs on the market (e.g. Nest, etc.) and from the reviews I read, it seemed as if the 2nd Gen Samsung SmartThings Hub offered everything I was looking for that I thought was lacking with respect to my Wink hub (and instead of upgrading to the 2nd Gen Wink Hub, I would simply upgrade to the Samsung hub as it was about the same price). Wow, did I make a terrible mistake.\n\nAs an initial matter, my research was correct with respect to the Samsung SmartThings Hub having a much better mobile app and having a lot more to offer than my original Wink Hub. However, as I quickly realized, the Samsung Hub was basically worthless to me as it is not backwards compatible with most all devices and in order to utilize same, you will need to upgrade all of your existing home automation devices to newest version of same (and even then, the devices available for the Samsung Hub are very limited, much more so than my old Wink Hub). For example, one of the home automation devices I currently utilize is the SkyBell video door bell (which I found was far superior to its more expensive competitors). Unfortunately, when I attempted to link my SkyBell device to my new Samsung Hub, I quickly discovered that the Samsung Hub will only work with the newest HD version of the SkyBell video doorbell (and which is 2x the cost of the original SkyBell device that works just perfectly).\n\nI could go on and on, especially with respect to the cameras supported by the 2nd Gen Samsung Hub. Speaking of cameras, if you desire to link cameras to this Samsung Hub, you will need to get your checkbook out as all, not just a few, but all of your existing cameras will not work with the 2nd Gen Samsung SmartThings Hub. If money is not an object, than you will have an excuse to upgrade all of your home automation devices if you purchase the new Samsung Hub (and on a side note, you will be better off keeping your cameras separate from your hub and investing in some quality POE IP Cameras - trust me).\n\nAs I have missed the return deadline, I basically have a $100 plastic box that does absolutely nothing. As pride myself on being an Amazon/eBay Buyer, and only a \"buyer,\" selling this worthless device is not an option so I have relegated myself to keep my new Samsung SmartThings Hub, for the next couple of years, in the back of my basement, by my server rack (with the hope that someday down the road, I will just happen to purchase some odd home automation device that will only work with this fancy new Samsung SmartThings Hub - so as to justify me throwing away $100 on it). If anything, I am keeping it as a reminder for me to be more diligent in my research when purchasing such devices (e.g. making sure that when the product says it supports a device, such as a SkyBell doorbell, I confirm that it supports the specific make/model of device I am looking to connect to it).\n\nLast but not least, I did end up purchasing the new 2nd-Gen Wink Hub and I could not be more pleased with same (as the folks at Wink finally figured out that having an Ethernet port on the hub was one of those important things they should have thought of when they rolled out the 1st gen Wink Hub ----- I can only assume that the design team at Wink finally hired a few younger folks who know what a RoKu device is and how important it is to be able to link same via a hardwire network connection.\n\nI hope the foregoing assists you with your decision making process and, so that we are clear, the Samsung SmartThings Hub is a quality device and has a modern/updated mobile app to make using it easy. But as discussed above, should you elect to go with this device, get your checkbook out as you will be buying all new devices for your home automation needs!\n\nM"}

My hue lights work 99% of the time when triggered by smart things. Plain old z-wave wall switches work 95% of the time.

I had been looking to setup a 2nd z-wave network in my house for a few months and finally pulled the trigger. I already had ADT Pulse setup with many switches and cameras but wanted to put any new devices on SmartThings going forward. The other reason was ST (SmartThings) is Z-Wave PLUS and my first new switch was going to be about 80 feet from the house behind our pool. I felt I needed the Z-Wave Plus range and ADT does not support it.\n\nI bought the new GE Z-Wave Plus 14291 Switch and was able to pair it quickly. I did have a problem with the light only turning on fine but not turning off. I moved the ST hub to a closer location and removed and added the switch again but still could not turn GE switch off reliably. After 4 hours of playing with it I could not determine if the switch or the Hub was the issue (or just the range). I gave up for the night. The next morning I tried it and it worked perfect. I didn't change anything it just started working so all good now.\n\nI also bought the Aeon Labs Minimote\nhttp://amzn.to/2nk05PM\n\nI set this up to turn the light switch on and off. Setup took under 2 minutes and it also now acts as a simple remote control for the light switch. It is setup as a secondary controller for ST Hub for those looking to do same.\n\nI also setup the Amazon Echo ( http://amzn.to/2mgTd4W ) to respond to commands to turn the light on and off (\"Alexa turn on backyard light\"). That worked great too and setup was without any hiccups.\n\nI look forward to adding more devices to my ST setup and updating this review as my system grows."}

A bit confusing but understandable given the circumstance I suppose. As the hub maker, Samsung does have an undue burden managing all of the software and such when most of the device content in my house is from other companies. There are definately quirks.\nI installed lots of Z-wave smart switches (~15) throughout the house (mostly GE) but a couple of items from another maker.\nFast forward several months and several firmware updates, some of my automated routines quit working (specifically the sunrise sunset ones). So following advice from forums I removed my home \"location\". I didn't realize at the time that this would wipe out ALL of my switches that were set up. So I had to go through a complicated process of excluding each switch so that it could be detected and added again. I have one switch in a storage space under my patio with steel and concrete floor so that switch does not see the hub directly. It works once set up by using another switched plug adapter that I installed purely to act as a Z-wave repeater. I guess though that the repeater does not work during setup and device exclusion process. So I had to move my hub with a long ethernet cable to a place that it could see this switch.. In the process of all of this and holding my phone over my head so that it would connect to wifi in the house while I pressed the switch for the exclusion process I ended up dropping my new galaxy S8 phone and breaking the display glass. So thanks Samsung for that..\n\nUpdate: Today I got some email from support folks at Smartthings about my welcome code issue. I had already gotten past that issue but took the opportunity to clarify some other things and got great support from them. They were able to log into my account and see my devices and routines and find a little problem with one of them. (kinda creepy but helpful)!"}

These bulbs are supposedly officially supported. Now, none of my automations work. I can no longer turn off or on lights with my phone or my Alexa.\n\nI work in IT as a network and server guy - I work all day with much more complicated hardware and software - but when I come home, I don't want to troubleshoot my home automation system and network - especially when the vendor broke it, not me.\n\nAfter contacting tech support, they tell me I might be able to get on a chat with them and they might be able to see what is going on with my SmartThings hub and maybe fix the device type issue BUT ... if that doesn't work, I'll have to delete all my bulbs and reconfigure my setup from scratch.\n\nI have hours upon hours of automations and timers setup. If I have to start over again, I'm going to buy the Wink 2 Hub and try my hand at that. Maybe it is more reliable."}

While the system does seem to stay online most of the time, the automation's are flaky at best.\n\nMy home and away modes trigger way off their set times, id say this would happen 3 out of the 7 days a week. I quickly started using Home Assistant and having had any of those type of issues.\n\nI think it is a great device that if could have a more consistent maybe \"offline\" mode and not use the cloud would be great. I do use it to test ideas and automation's to see if I enjoy them (when they work) so I can hard program them into my Home Assistant.\n\nSince I am still learning how to program I prefer using something easy like smartthings to test a otherwise intense automation, then once I like it I learn to code it."}

I have about 30 devices connected via z-wave, zigbee, and Wi-Fi. While it is not 100% perfect, it is very reliable, and an excellent tool for controlling \"stuff\" in your home. Among the greatest things about it is the community of users who assist with SmartApps and tips. One of the best is found at rboyapp.com where you can find a multitude of Device handlers and SmartApps to help you cleverly and easily control many of the more complex items you may wish to add (e.g, Thermostats, Garage Door Openers, Door Locks, etc.). My most recent addition is a kickspace heater in my kitchen (which had limited heating and was always cold) controlled by an Intermatic relay that is connected to SmartThings, which turns on the heater only when the temperature is below a certain point and there is motion detected in the room.\n\nI also have several Amazon Dots integrated with SmartThings to make it even easier to control lights and other devices. If you are looking for a flexible, reliable, and powerful Home Automation Hub, I recommend that you select SmartThings."}
