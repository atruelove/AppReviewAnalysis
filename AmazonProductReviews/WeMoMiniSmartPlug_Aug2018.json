If you can't return it (as I can't), then at least *maybe* you can get it working as a timer. But for remote control... GOOD LUCK! Do NOT go near WEMO crap."}

I have a wemo light switch and a wemo insight, that do not have these problems. Before you buy this, look at the wemo support board and search around for wifi connectivity problems. You will see all sorts of issues. This is amazing for a company to release something like this with buggy firmware. I would imagine the only people giving this a positive review are ones with simple wifi networks with basic security and simple passwords. If you have technically involved wifi setup (think dd-wrt, merlin, etc...) you are going to spend hours trying to work around this devices wifi compatability problem. Belkin, it's 2018, the wifi standard should be pretty clear by now for interoperability...."}

Multiple times a week the switch freezes and I have to reset the circuit breaker to get it back in working order. No resets, factory resets, long presses or any other recommended action has cured it to this point.\n\nWith most companies this would not be a problem, however Belkin is not most companies. My experience with warranty support on the plug has taught me to not bother with this one, as they are sticklers on the warranty and seem to care less if you are happy with their products and services.\n\nI now intend to replace all of my wemo products as they go bad and institute a policy of avoiding Belkin as a company. In an addition, I have 2 unopened switches and two unopened slim plugs that i would be willing to trade for fertilizer at this point. :/"}

Once the device connected to my network it asked me if I wanted to install the latest firmware. Of course I wanted to do it. That firmware update has HomeKit compatibility. It downloaded and installed and in a few minutes it was done. I then connected it to the HomeKit app on my phone and BAM!! It was done. I ask Siri to do things and she has no problem. I went to work the next day and tested the remote access and scared my wife who thought that the TV was turning by accident but who was also ready to run if need be. I\u2019m buying more.

Too late to return and tried to service with Belkin, they just replaced with another that works no better.\n\nI have been able to install the mini on one router/cable modem but not another, but I have not been able to get beyond that. The Regular Wemo smart plug does not seem to install ok and works fine, but I tried to add the mini to the same network as my other two (Netgear 3500 router SB6121 cable modem) and the mini fails setup. On my other network (separate location, SB6141 modem, AC1750 router) it connects on maybe the second try. Unfortunately the apps for Wemo only let you have all your wemo devices on the same network, so some on one and some on the other does not work (other systems let you do this). Those of use using this in two locations have an issue as a result. When I returned this I even asked if Belkin could just replace it with the less expensive regular smart plug, but they would not.\n\nOn the plus side the regular version of the smart plugs work with Alexa, Google home, have programmable away mode and are pretty reliable. The mini however is flakier, I've seen it lose connection and require resetting, and am unsure if I trust it like others. Gone through three now, one returned to Amazon, one returned to Belkin and their replacement I am stuck with.\n\nUntil Belkin fix their mini to work on all current routers, and fix their app to support multiple locations, I cannot recommend this product.

{"Author": "Hades", "Date": "on August 4, 2018", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "After a Power Outage Device Does not Power Back On. Horrible Design.", "Text": "While the insight smart plug works \"when it is working\" it has a major limitation. In the case of a power outage, the device requires a manual push of the power button to power it back on. Upon further investigation, this issue has been raised by customers since 2012 on Wemo/Belkins support page. Wemo's response is that it is a safety issue and that is why they require manual intervention. That Wemo does not provide customers with an option as to whether they want to incur this risk is a shame and what's even more problematic is that customers have been complaining about this on their support page for OVER 5Yrs with little to no input from their support staff who occasionally seem to provide responses on the support forums.\nTo showcase how ridiculous this feature is and how it's enforced implementation by Wemo is even more of a safety issue, My Internet Router, Wireless Access point and other gear plug into a strip that plugs into the Wemo insight. I also have several security cameras around the property that rely on wireless access for notifications and the like. These are plugged into regular outlets.\nI had a Power outage and the Wemo did not \"self power back on\" or go back to the previous state which was on. Therefore, my Internet connection remained down, my wireless remained down and my cameras were in effect useless as they could not record to the cloud and or to my local storage since the network was down until I manually powered on the Wemo. IFFT and all other automation apps that people will recommend all require internet access to detect the state of a device and therefore act, so they (I believe) are not a solution to this problem as stated.\nWemo if you are reading this, it is a glaring miss on your part. What's more bothersome is that users have been requesting this feature for over 5 yrs with several examples such as mine given of why your implementation of this feature is a limiter. I bought several of these devices and I'm looking for replacement options based on their inaction and for the simple fact that the \"feature\" introduces more risk than I care to deal with.\nV."}

{"Author": "Homekit News and Reviews", "Date": "on August 4, 2018", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Now works with HomeKit without needing the WeMo hub", "Text": "As many reading this a probably aware by now, WeMo recently announced that their Mini Smart Plug was the first ostensibly non-HomeKit compatible device to gain HomeKit compatibility, via the new Software Authentication protocol. Intrigued by this, I decided a purchase was in order, despite the fact that I\u2019ve already got quite a few smart plugs to spare.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read my previous reviews, you\u2019ll be aware that I put a lot of stock into presentation (the packaging basically), and on this count I would say that WeMo have delivered admirably. As with many of the current manufacturers of smart devices, the container that the smart plug came in was super sturdy, being made of a thick recycled (?) cardboard, enclosed in a green and white outer sleeve. Green seems to be the colour of choice these days, with iHome and Vocolinc both also opting for this colour scheme. Whether this is an effort to imbue their products with some form of \u2018eco-friendliness\u2019 I\u2019m not sure, but it certainly works on an aesthetic level.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve taken off the outer sleeve, you can really see that WeMo have gone the extra mile, with a lovely design on the inside of the carton \u2013 something you\u2019d only see once you had already purchased the product, so this isn\u2019t just to entice you, it\u2019s to encourage and excite you into taking WeMo seriously, in that they think about the smaller details.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve open the box fully to reveal the smart plug itself, you can see that it\u2019s housed nicely within the centre of the box, giving it little chance to move around and potentially get damaged. There\u2019s an included manual to help with quick setup along with any problems you might have with the plug, in the form of a list of troubleshooting tips.\n\nAt the end of the day, of all the categories of smart devices, smart plugs offer the most choice, and while some can do small things that others can\u2019t do (like monitor electricity usage for example), they all basically do the same job of turning a \u2018dumb\u2019 device on or off, giving said device some level of automation. This device is no different to any of those in that basic respect. It\u2019s fairly slim, or wide, depending on how you look at it, but being this slim it does offer the advantage of not taking up more than one wall socket, which in turn means that it can be stacked with another WeMo smart plug quite comfortably.\n\nThe design of the plug itself is quite unassuming, which would lend itself to blending into a typical, mainly white kitchen. Simple branding aside, the only other thing on the front is a rather convenient on/off switch, with a small LED that lights up in white, when there\u2019s power going to the plug. Going back briefly to its dimensions, while it\u2019s not quite as slim as the iHome iSPX6, it comes close, although it is slightly taller. it does beat out the iDevices Switch in the \u2018skinny\u2019 department, but once again it is wider/taller, so it really is down to the individual as to what works for them.\n\nOnto the setup: As this device isn\u2019t a \u2018straight-out-the-box\u2019 HomeKit product, with no HomeKit code provided \u2013 or even needed \u2013 the procedure was a little bit more involved; not necessarily complicated, but a little long-winded nonetheless. First off, you need to download the WeMo app to get things started. Once the app is downloaded and running, you simply plug the device into an outlet and let the app guide you through the process of initially setting it up to work with the WeMo app. Interestingly, even though the setup process for getting it to integrate with HomeKit comes later, the first thing you\u2019re asked on opening the WeMo app is access to your \u2018Home Data\u2019, meaning your current Apple Home data. Once you\u2019ve okayed this, you choose which device you want to set up, you\u2019re then presented with a few tips as to setup process itself. This involves connecting your iPhone or iPad to the wi-fi signal of the plug itself in order to exchange you home wi-fi network settings. Once all that\u2019s \u2018in the bag\u2019, the app will attempt to connect to the device itself, which in my case took a little bit of time.\n\nIt eventually spots the plug and asks you to name the device (if you so wish \u2013 I stuck with \u2018Wemo Mini\u2019). You\u2019ll then be prompted to provide an email address to complete the process before it proceeds to finally connect directly to your home network. After that is complete, you then get to choose whether you\u2019d like it to send you notifications.\n\nAs I already mentioned, this was a lengthy, if straightforward process, but once you\u2019re at this point, you\u2019ll see the smart plug show up as a device that can now be programmed or controlled within the WeMo app. Chances are that there will be at least one, if not two firmware updates awaiting you. One of these will be for the plug itself, which is reassuring to know that kinks are spotted and ironed out by way of these updates. The other is to enable the plug to work with HomeKit, which is the whole reason this is being reviewed of course! Once you\u2019ve updated the firmware, you\u2019ll finally get to the section that allows for HomeKit connectivity. You\u2019re given options for connecting the plug to IFTTT, Nest, Alexa and finally, the Apple Home App. Google isn\u2019t on this list for some reason, but you can connect to Google assistant via the Google Home app.\n\nWe\u2019re on the home straight now, so it\u2019s just connecting the plug to the Home app, which in most respects appears in the same way it would if you were adding a standard HomeKit compatible device, minus the part where you have to scan a code.\n\nFrom here on in, like with a standard install, it\u2019s simply a case of choosing which room the plug resides in, whether it appears as a Light, Powerpoint or Fan, and whether you wish to add it to your favourites. It will then appear in your standard Home app, along with any 3rd party apps you may use.\n\nI\u2019ve only been using it for about 24 hours, and so far I\u2019ve found it to be as responsive as all my other plugs, with no real sign of extra lag from touching the tile in the app, to the corresponding on or off. The device itself emits a small \u2018click\u2019 when it\u2019s turned on or off (which may be good for some and terrible for others), and the LED above the physical switch turns white or turns off respectively.\n\nAs previously stated, it does work with other platforms, and while it isn\u2019t compatible with Wink, unlike the aforementioned iHome smart plug, it does have IFTTT, which may actually be of more use.\n\nAfter setting the device up, I unplugged it from mains power briefly, to see if it would reconnect without any issues, and it did reconnect after about a minute or so. However, I did a second test, where I left it disconnected overnight, and on this occasion it took a full uninstall and reinstallation to get it back to where I had it, which in fact took two attempts, with the first take managing to somehow render the physical button unresponsive. A second full reset solved the issue and once I\u2019d gone through the lengthy installation process again, it was all good.\n\nIn my final assessment, it\u2019s great to see how devices are going to work with the new Software Authentication process, and I\u2019m hoping that when other manufacturers do get on board, the set up isn\u2019t as long as this one was, even though I can see that most steps seemed to be necessary. However, there are a ton of choices for smart plugs out there, and while this device is a little cheaper than many of them, you do find some good deals occasionally, which essentially boils this down to just another smart plug.\n\nPros\nslim, so easy to stack with another of these if needed\nrelatively cheap\ngood support from a reputable company\n\nCons\nlong-winded set up process\nnot great at remembering settings if left unplugged\nStill, I\u2019d recommend it for those on a budget who also don\u2019t want to obscure two wall outlets with one plug."}

The button on top is touch sensitive and you can manually turn on and off whatever you have plugged into it.

However, if it is a simple small two or three prong plug, it will fit. Two of the WEMO smart plugs will fit in same outlet. They were fairly easy to set up on Android cell phone (Samsung). I had hoped they could be controlled by voice, but it does not look like they are voice activated. I did successfully set up on phone so I just click the app, then click the device I want to turn on or off. I also set up a schedule to randomly turn lights on and off. I park my car in garage, so potential intruders will not know if I am home or not. With lights going on and off at odd times, I feel like my house is less of a target.

This plug makes it super easy to control older devices with Alexa or Google Assistant. Setup is fairly easy, but sometimes Wi-Fi range may be an issue. I found that because the plug is fairly small the Wi-Fi reception suffers, especially if you place it behind furniture. One other negative is that when you toggle the plug on/off there is a loud click.\n\nFor this smart plug, the convenience outweighs the poor Wi-Fi and clicking."}

Did as much research as I could before hand, but some things you don't find out until you've already had your electrician install the product. I found that my WEMO dimmer system did not play well with the Lithonia Track Lighting system using low-voltage LED lights, which flickered and buzzed. I eventually replaced the LED lights with Edison filament type lights, which worked fine.\n\nAlso, you can not use WEMO dimmers on a 3-way lighting scheme, that is, 2 light switches that operate the same set of lighting, i.e. light switches on either end of the kitchen that control the same track lighting.\n\nA user experience issue I have a huge problem with is the perpetual pulsating blue light that causes a huge problem if this dimmer is installed in your bedroom. It's enough to light up the bedroom at night and keep you from sleeping. After 3 months I started taping some plastic packaging over the dimmer at night to try and block most of the ambient light coming from the dimmer. I really wish WEMO would consider this issue and have some way of turning down the luminosity of the dimmer to account for bedroom scenarios.\n\nWemo Dimmer Wi-Fi Light Switch, Works with Alexa and Google Assistant"}

I ran across an issue where the original 2 gang face plate sticks out and looks very unprofessional. to figure out why, I placed the switch into the multi-gang face plates which let me see that the face plate has plastic reinforcing nubs (strengthening the screw holes) causing the plate to stick out. I was able to grind (with a Dremel) the nubs on the inside of my face plate and the plate fits perfectly.\nOne thing to note, I doubt I would be able to get a second smart switch into this 2 gang box. I am trying to figure out if I can get more than one into a 3 gang and a 4 gang box. The fact is, there are a bunch of wires in the box and these switches take up a bunch of room. It would also be nice if they had a 3 way version like the TP Link one. And a bigger ask, a 3 way dimmer.\nOnce installed connecting this to the network was pretty simple. Powered on the breaker, the switch went into setup mode, flashing green and amber. found its broadcast wifi network and connected my phone, then ran the WeMo app to finish the install. The switch then went green and control from my phone was working. I then did a discovery from the Alexa app and added it to my smart devices."}

Dirt is the enemy. If you have ever been to a Best Buy and have seen the display for this you will probably notice it looks really dirty. Well, yours is going to look like that too. I don't believe we are messy, but the light switch seems to think we are. The non-glossy texture grabs every bit of dirt or dust and traps it.. Even trying to clean it doesn't do anything. It seems like it has stained the plastic.\n\n2. It disconnects from the internet often. When it disconnects, it needs to be manually reset and connected back on with the app. There doesn't seem to be a built in memory to grab the same connection it had before. This seems to happen at least twice a month. That doesn't seem like a big deal, but when getting a \"smart\" light switch you want it to work without constant tweaking.\n\n3. Lastly, the price is far too high for something like this. The only reason you would buy this is so you can have something like Alexa turn on the lights through voice. I swore to myself and my wife it was worth the $70+ dollars, but I have been proven wrong so many times by saying \"Alexa, turn on the living room light\" and having her say that it has been disconnected and can't communicate with the switch.\n\nAfter months, I found this too be a complete disappointment. When it works, its great! Pricey, but great. But for the price, I expect it to work without fail."}

In general once the app is correctly paired with the device, we like the convenience of a smart plug/ switch. We have also integrated them into our Google Smart Home, so we can say \u201cHey Google, turn on the couch light\u201d, which is convenient. Doing so does not require any programming (IFTTT, etc.) so that\u2019s nice.\n\nIn terms of fit and finish, they hit the mark. it\u2019s well manufactured and components look good. I have two concerns, however:\n1) getting it online with your network remains a challenge. All previous Wemo plugs have shared this issue. The firmware shipped from the factory is usually quite out of date, and I went through several upgrades trying to get it to connect to my network. As was the case with the plugs, it seemed to hang during the upgrade process, and I had to bite the bullet and cut power/ restore, and hope for the best. Fortunately, it worked out, and I was able to connect it.\n\n2). Unlike the plugs, the switch installs in site the outlet box (no surprise). If your outlet box is metal, though, it is not as reliable as the plugs are. As I said, we\u2019re running 7-8 plugs throughout our home, including one that it right below this switch. We are running a Meraki router (Cisco\u2019s small business product). All of the plugs work flawlessly, whether connected to the primary router or a relay access point. However, this light switch is somewhat less reliable. There are some days where it just doesn\u2019t come on. I\u2019ve confirmed all programming, and it\u2019s correct. When I\u2019ve run it hanging outside the box as an experiment, it worked fine. But when installed in the metal box, the WiFi signal is just attenuated enough that it fails a about 1 day out of 12. Installed location is approximately 14\u2019 away from the WiFi router, and the signal measures very clean, so it\u2019s not the WiFi. Only conclusion I can reach is that the metal box interferes with the signal just enough to make it less reliable."}

Adding it to the app is the same as any other Wemo products. And it automatically showed up in Home app if you have the HomeKit bridge. Controlling it with Siri or the Home app is effortless, now I can add the dimming switch to my automations and it's great. If you already have Wemo products and want to replace a \"dumb\" dimmer switch with a smart switch, this is the way to go.

I hope this helps those with similar situations. I'm using an AT&T Velocity as a wi-fi hotspot, which is my sole internet access, with an Echo Plus with hub. I purchased this Wemo mini when offered with a discount, so figured, what the heck, give it a try, if it doesn't work, not out a lot of money or hassle to return. Even though it did not work for me, I gave 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) appears very well made & went into set up mode within seconds of plugging it in 2) small footprint allows use of the other socket or plugging in two of these 3) easy download of app for kindle fire or android phone 4) App recognized & connected to the mini plug within seconds and 5) appears that with a proper & compatible home network/router, set up would have been a breeze & the device up & running in just a few minutes.\n\nThe app was unable to connect or even find my wi-fi hotspot & apparently, the plug is not meant to. I am grateful the plug was on special, so great opportunity to try it for my situation. I'll either hang on to it in hopes that real internet will be available one day in my area, or it will make a great gift for a good price. At least now I know wi-fi enabled smart plugs won't work with a hotspot. BTW, I am successfully running 3 fire tablets, an Echo Plus with hub, Echo, Dot & a Tap, as well as a Fire TV Stick, along with 6 Phillips Hue bulbs with 2 - 3 bars of service on the Velocity hotspot, which is just amazing. For now, it seems the way to go for those of us who are internet access challenged would be zigbee compatible smart plugs which do require a hub, in my case, the Echo Plus.\n\nThat said, if Wemo offers such a plug or if my internet situation changes that this mini plug would work, I would definitely purchase based on the quality & ease of use based on what I was able to do with set up using the Wemo app & device, even though not compatible with my internet access."}

Since they are freshly installed, I cannot speak as to their longevity but since I have strong wifi throughout my home, I anticipate connectivity issues to be few. Installation was simple as they were replacing other home automation switches. If it is a new installation they should install easily as long as you have a line/load/neutral wire in your switch box.\n\nThese switches occupy more volume than traditional switches so be prepared to organize and stuff the wires behind the switch! Programming the switches is easy enough but as you install more switches the interface gets a bit crowded. No serious complaints as the programming should not need to be fooled around with much once it is done."}

Zero problems.", "Text": "There are a lot of cheap smart plugs out there, but I went with this WeMo for two reasons: WeMo/Belkin has been around pretty much since the beginning of the smart home and isn't likely to go away, and they have a whole ecosystem of components that work together using the same app and support. I could save a few bucks, but I want to know everything is going to work together, and work for more than three months.\n\nI really like the form factor of this plug; allowing two plugs in a standard outlet is hugely helpful. That said, it would be great if they could manage to make it somewhat narrower - it takes up a lot of space in a surge protector if it has to be placed length-wise. (I would happily trade a little thickness for less width.) The look is sleek and minimal, and the on/off button is very convenient.\n\nOne final reason I chose this one is because of the option of using a bridge to make it HomeKit (Apple/Siri) compatible. I'm currently using an Amazon Echo Dot, but the rest of my system is Apple-based and wanted the option to switch over to that platform if I choose to in the future."}

I have other brands of Wifi switches that work on and off with Alexa and Google Home. This switch works every....single....time.\n\nI won't go into too much detail. It was very easy to install because it comes with the colored wires that I simply matched to my outlet. Because the wires come from this device, I just had to pop the cap on and voila, that's it - vs. other switches where I have to take the wires, re-twist or shave them and put them into a slot in the switch.\n\nSoftware is dead easy to use. You can't possibly mess up installation. Has some pretty nice modes and settings for automation after the fact. One mode I really like is auto-off mode. My home is semi automated. I have Amazon Echos AND Google Homes in almost every bedroom. I have wifi bulbs all over the place. Every closet and bathroom has an occupancy/vacancy sensor which turns on when someone goes in, stays on for as long as they're in there and then goes off shortly after they exit. You can't really use an occupancy sensor with a bedroom, well, you can, technically. You can use something that you manually turn on and will stay on for as long as it detects motion and turns off automatically when you leave. I wanted a dimmer for my master bedroom and it's very nice to know that I can enable this sort of behavior with this device when I want it.\n\nThis is a bit more expensive than others you may see out there but in many ways, it's very much worth it. I will wait until it goes on sale and buy one for every bedroom in my home eventually."}

Sometimes at this point the App just quits.\n\nI know how usless Belkin Tech Support is so I wouldn't even bother to call them, I'm more tech savvy then they are. But I did go to their Support Forum and YES these Wemo Mini Smart Plugs are plagued with issues. Mostly just like I'm experiencing. For the lucky few who actually finally got them to connect, after hours of trying, it wasn't for long. If power was lost they would not reconnect and the process had to be started all over again. For others they would not keep a connection, they'd work for a while and then stop. Some folks the device wouldn't even appear in the App. The list of issues went on and on.\n\nThre trouble shooting page on Belkins web site has a long list of things to do if you can't get them to work.. REALLY Belkin you know of the many issues and you can't fix the problem. Oh they will gladly take your information and get you to a \"Level 2 Specialist\" who know less then you do! Oh an apparently it has been noted on their web site that different production runs of the Wemo Mini will have differnt results. OMG!\n\nAnyway, I sent these back to Amazon for a full refund. I hope I save some people from having to waste their time and the aggravation with a product that just does not work as it should, especially for what they cost! I once really like them but I'm done with Belkin!"}

The entire time the \"away schedule\" was active, the light switch was on, the app was connected to wifi, the light was in the on position, and properly plugged into the outlet. Unfortunately, the floor lamp plugged into it kept turning on/off randomly and continuously. There was no way I could have this happening while trying to work.

I just ordered two Wemos to replace them and I am very happy. I don't have to physically access them and instead control them from my phone. I want my fragrance device to go off at appointed times during the day and only stay on for an hour so I don't use it up. I'm able to set those times easily although my only complaint is that I have to go in and out of the app screen to set each time.

I tried changing network parameters from within the app for the switches and they ended up disappearing, so I had to do a full hard reset on them anyway."}

I read a good review of the Wemo mini, but didn't do much on-line research before I decided to buy one -- just one, to test it myself. If the price is in an acceptable range, that is the best way after all. Besides, I've always been a little wary of Belkin products. They sometimes just haven't worked very well for me in the past.\n\nThe packaging was waaay too big for the item itself. A real waste of cardboard! Come-on marketing. You can do better.\n\nThe installation instructions were simple enough - 6 steps in all, maybe the part about changing your wifi router to \"Wemo.Mini\" is a little confusing to a total non-geek (I've been doing computer stuff since before the first PC). Anyway, the sheet also includes a troubleshooting section on the back. Good thing! The Wemo app would not connect the Wemo mini to my dirt standard stock comcast Xfi wifi router (there must be millions of these around the country.) Then, after about 8 tries, just when I'm about to send it back, it connected for no apparent reason.\n\nMoving on, I have read since that the app itself has an old tired interface, but I have an iPhone 7, so I'm used to old tired interfaces. No matter, it's simple enough. I was able to set up rules and they actually worked. That's really all I wanted...except... I also want remote access. It simply won't connect. I have studied on-line resources, opened ports on my router (which is BTW very clunky with XFi) to no avail. I have no intention of spending hours and hours figuring out how to do this -- I'll simply try another product for another US$30 - $40 and see if it works better. You hear that, Belkin?"}

The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it's a pain in the you-know-what to set up. I have two of them and both of them were equally as difficult to get working. I'm in the tech business and have install many a smart devices, this was hands down the most difficult to get working, but when it does it's great.\n\nLike most smart devices this can be controlled through the app from anywhere and works very well with Google Assistant. I can't speak to Alexa as I don't have one. If you get this, you'll be happy once it's working, just be ready to spend some frustrating time with it as you get it set up."}

Be a real shame if some dim-wit (pun intended) burned his house down...\n\nWhile I have your attention- I love Alexa! I have FOUR 2nd -gen Echo units strategically placed around the house. I've noticed there is a battery-pack available for the US and UK for portability, unfortunately, \"This Product Does Not Ship To Australia\" ;) I suspect there might some voltage issues?...

Not sure about other Wifi switches but the Wemo is significantly larger than the simple switch I was replacing. The other remaining switch I needed to keep was a dimmer which was also large presenting an issue because either one by itself would fit but both together would not. After a lot of cursing I ended up having to hack saw off two protruding metal tabs on the box while not accidentally cutting the wires within AND trimming the dimmer switch. You cannot really trim or adjust the size of the WeMo switch since it is plastic. I thought it would be more daunting but it was actually quite easy. Just make sure you cut the power.\n\nAs far as the operation. So far so good. Downloaded the App. Paired the switch. Set a rule. Works as it should so far."}

You can set by days of the week, I even set kids bedrooms and baths to turn off at 7:30 am M-F after they are off to school.\n3. Set lights in timers. For instance I set outside lights to turn on and off at sunrise or sunset with a delay just before or after, Automatically adjusts to changes in both times. I set all bed room lights to go off at 10pm.\n4. Set dimmers for night time scheduled to auto dim between evening hours so not so bright.\nFuture things I want to do, add cameras for auto sense on operation.\nLots and lots of options we these units. I have added to google home and can use voice to control lights. I can turn off and on remotely.\nI have one sleepy headed kid to get up for school\nDaily do I set off and on cycles to flash lights when it\u2019s time to get up as a parent aid.\nCouple things I would advise you have prior to install, make sure you have a robust network and a router which is capable of a large number of wireless conections and has good cover late area. In my case I have an Orbi RBK 50 router with 2 satilite units able to handle up to 250 connections. I am also running a CM1000 cable modem connected to a 1GB Comcast/ Xfinity connection. Rock solid I cannot day enough great things about theses either, I have a 4700+Sq/ ft home no problems/issues.\n\nPros:\n1. Easy to install, but you may need additional faceplaces for multigange switches.\n2. These fit well into multigange switches (ie 2 or three switches together)\n3. Love the scheduling timers and features, you can even select long push option to turn on other lights in your home too great feature when coming home long press a single switch and have some or all of your lights come on. And/ or you can also tie into nest thermastat which can sense your phone presence coming home and turn the lights on.\n4. Great way to attack your electric bill and get it down, I just installed these so I won\u2019t know for a month or two just how much I was able to reduce.\n\nCons: Nothing too major.\n1. Wish 2 pole support was available even in the form as a remote transmitter from second switch. I worked around this by converting switches to single pole by capping off red hot lines from both switches and removing second switch and tying together 2 black lines and putting a lank plate over it. Should WEMO offer a solution in the future no problem to add back. Otherwise, allot of the features off set the loss of the second switch.\n2. Wish these were a bit thinner in depth, some of my switch boxes were pretty crowded with wires.\n3. Pricing; Lack of bulk pricing discounts I bought individual units from Amazon they were cheaper than the 2 unit packs, for the dimmer switches I bought the 2 packs. I wish I could have bought in 5,10,20 or 25 bulk packs at a lower price. I even called Belkin/WEMO directly but these are not available.\n\nOverall great experience I plan on buying 10 more switches and 7 dimmers in the future just need to save up some after this last purchase!! Highly recommend."}

Connecting a device takes at minimum 4 tries, plus additional tries if there are any problems. The app just assumes you want to connect it to the same wifi network you used last time, unchecking 'Remember wifi settings' does nothing. This will screw you over terribly if you are doing a large install. There is no way to sort devices by which room they are in, or any other way for that matter including just rearranging the order they are listed in. There is no way to skip the dimmer calibrations.\nEvery single time you go to change to a different wifi, you must completely close the program and reopen it or it will hang. It will hang every time you toggle a dimmer and then take you all the way back to the top of the unsortable menu. It will hang randomly at any time just touching it once or twice.\nThere are many things I like about this switch, that it uses MQTT and can be run fine over a completely disconnected network for instance. Once they are setup, bar some change in the wifi they seem to stay connected and reconnect fairly reliably. I'll report back about the long term stability of them."}

Having done this dozens of times with supervision I was able to figure it out. I am now no expert but have installed without having to call anyone. Amazon Alex help is MUCH better than WEMO help. However both called back the next day to ask how I was doing.

Initial install and setup was easy. I just followed the instructions and everything seemed to work fine. I got it to work with my Amazon Echo voice commands. About an hour late I was excited to show my wife that I've converted another \"dumb\" light switch to a smart one. I asked Alexa to turn on my front door lights. And it ended up telling me it wasn't responding. I then tried my Lutron lights commands which worked fine. I then reset everything on the Wemo Light Switch and deleted it from my Amazon account and started pairing like it was brand new and it worked. Later in the day it stopped working again. So I figured I'll try a loop around and use IFTTT with it, but same thing ended up happening. I thought to myself maybe it just doesn't like Alexa, so I paired it with my Google Home and the exact same situation happened. Works right after setup, but it'll just stop after a couple hours. I got fed up ordered another Lutron and returned the Wemo."}

I don't know if this is a issue, but I will keep and eye on them. Other than that, really easy to set up in my wifi network. All you have to do is put your network password in only one switch, wemo recognizes the network when setting up another switches. This is really convenience when you have to set up more than one switch. I bought six of them. I used a different brand before and it asked me for my network password all the time. Setting up schedules is also pretty straight forward."}

This was the half-baked iPhone app.\n2) the plug keeps disconnecting from wifi. It will work for a day and then blink orange. I tried power cycling and then even doing a full reset, and neither of those worked. Now all my wemo mini plugs are basically paperweight.\n\nNote that I have many other smart devices, and my Lutron wall switches work just fine 99.9% of the time with both Siri and Google Home! The most frustrating thing is I bought their stupid hub as well to get the switches to work with Siri, and now it's just lying there doing nothing.\n\nIn short, I would rather WALK UP to the switch than use wemo.\n\nPS: Customer service was as smart as a dodo. They basically wanted me to do the same things I'd already done, and even when those were exhausted, they had no other ideas."}

Great you think. Then you get rid of a device or 2 and even reset it as recommended. But guess what... those devices are still able to control them because you didn\u2019t go into the wemo app and remove remote access for that device before you sold it or traded it in. The full phone/device reset doesn\u2019t remove your devices! And who remembers to go into the settings of your dozens or hundreds of apps to double check something like this?\n\nThere is no security login setup for the wemo app so no way to control what\u2019s in their cloud so you\u2019re stuck with those devices.\n\nI have 4 old devices that are listed in my remote access section i can disable them but somehow they get reenabled. I went to look it up and you\u2019ll see even though this has been an issue since 2015, it\u2019s still not fixed!

Similar issues when it's time to turn itself off. After a few attempts to find a fix (which revealed other bugs in the WeMo app on android!), I'm about ready to give up using it for this simple use case of turning a light on and off automatically at a set time.\n\nSearch for \"wemo turns off at wrong time\" on google and you'll see the long, multi-year thread about this bug with hundreds of people on it asking for a fix and trying to find a solution.

And to any of the naysayers out there, I'm an electrician and followed all of the steps properly to set them up on the app.\n\nFirst of all, these things take forever and a day to update if an update comes out for it. So you get to sit there and watch the white led flash until it's done. Next, it will ask you if you want to save your wi-fi settings to make future setups easier. I have chosen that option but it's completely worthless. If your power ever goes out or you reset your router, you have to go through the pain and reconnect these pieces of junk to your wi-fi all over again. Otherwise it will just sit there and flash red, indicating that there is an issue. Lastly, trying to get them to connect to your wi-fi is like pulling teeth at the same time of ripping your hair out. You have to connect to the switch's wi-fi first, then go through the dimming steps and then choose the wi-fi that you want it to connect to. Then it bounces around connectivity between the switch, your cell phones network and then your home wi-fi. AND IF YOUR LUCKY, IT WILL MAGICALLY CONNECT! It's absolutely frustrating for a \"smart switch!\" if you are going to spend the money on this switch, spend a few bucks more and get the iDevices switches. I have a bunch of those installed in other parts of my home and they work flawlessly! Setup was easier than ever and it automatically connects in the event of power loss or internet loss. Plus they work in a 2-way or 3-way or 4-way setup. These crappy Wemo switches are only one way! Trust me people, stay away!!"}

The controls are simple, easy to use, and look great on my walls.\n\nHowever, that's pretty much where my praises for this device end. The additional connectivity and control features are what make this dimmer switch attractive, and justify the price tag. Unfortunately this is where this wemo device falls flat on its face. I've spent countless hours attempting to connect these devices to my Asus wireless router with zero success. The android app is poorly written and relies on end users having a very simple wifi configuration in their home. Multiple APs? Nope, not supported. 5Ghz band routers? Nope. Even something simple like having spaces in your wifi ssid name isn't supported. I've even read in the support forums that your wifi name can't start with a capital letter or number. Trust me, you will be spending quite a bit of time reading through the support forums. WTF?\n\nThe only way I was able to get these devices connected to a wifi network was to set up my 5 year old TP-Link router and experiment with different router settings so that I didn't disrupt wifi for the rest of my family while troubleshooting these things. They remain on that network today because I've already spent way too much time fiddling with them to want to go through the entire process again. Simply put, this product is/was not ready to be released. The level of wifi and networking technical knowledge required to configure these switches is unacceptable for a residential product.\n\nOh, and if you want to upgrade your wireless router? Good luck getting these dimmer switches to forget about the old wifi network and connect to a new one. The wifi reset process provided by wemo/belkin doesn't always work either.\n\nAll that being said, if you can survive the trials of getting these devices connected and working, they seem to work well with few problems. I've had 2 of these dimmer switches working in my home for about 5 months with no additional problems beyond initial setup."}

{"Author": "Deepers", "Date": "on April 13, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Awesome features, but froze too many times", "Text": "I really wanted to give this 2 stars for some major flaws, but 4 stars for functionality. So here I am at 3 stars.\nFirst the flaws: it frequently locks up (as in, becomes unresponsive). What good is a light switch, as smart as it is, if it can't turn on the lights? This was the single biggest reason I had to uninstall it (after 4 lock ups in just a few months, my wife couldn't take it anymore). I did the software updates and all, but that didn't help. Also, the \"blue light\" area shown in the pictures hides 3 \"reset\" options... reset wifi, restart device, reset whole device. They don't work properly. When the switch locks up and become unresponsive, I would try to hit each area of the switch in an attempt to resolve the issue. Tap, hold for 1 second, hold for 2, hold for 10... all actions had the same result. The LEDs would light up, \"count down\" and that's it. No change in behavior at all (switch was still locked up). The only way to get control of your lights again is to trip and reset the circuit breaker. Unfortunately, that reset everything in the room that was on the same circuit.\nSecond flaw is annoying but eventually resolves itself: wifi setup is finicky. Here, your phone connects to the switch (essentially wifi direct mode), transfers over the wifi access info for your network, and then disconnects. Then both switch and phone are supposed to reconnect to your normal wifi network, find each other and then proceed with setup. Well, this often failed, and I'd have to restart the process a few times. But after 3 or 4 attempts, it would work.\nLast gripe is that the pics make the switch look like it has a nightlight mode. It does NOT. That LED is never on permanently. It only flashes when you touch the switch (or do it remotely) to indicate that it is processing a command. That's it. They reallly didn't need such a huge LED to indicate that, nor do the marketing photos need to show it on like a nightlight. They even make it appear blue, when most of the time mine was white.\n\nAs far as features go, it was great. Love the single touch toggle (touch once for on, touch again for off)... no rocker, no separate on/off button. Also like the slide-to-dim on the touch panel feature (can even do it before turning on the light so it doesn't start off too bright). Awesome! Loved the scheduling features in the app, such as the one that sets the default brightness at a certain time (so you can, for example, say from midnight to 6am, set my default to 20% brightness, and so if you turn on the light in the middle of the night, it's soothingly dim instead of blindingly bright).\n\nIt also integrates easily with Google Home/Assistant.\n\nBut again, the great features are useless if the switch doesn't work (the lockups)."}

I had them connected to a LinkSys WRT54G router and Surfboard 6120 modem. And while I had the switches connected to those old devices, they worked well. Unfortunately, the rest of the devices in the house were lagging and not connecting well, because of the outdated modem and router.\n\nI upgraded the house to TP-Link gear (EAP 245 & TL-ER6020 Router) connected to a much newer 6183 Surfboard. And then my issues began. I was unable to get the switches to connect to the WeMo app, though I could see them connecting to my network. Without the app, I was unable to control the switches remotely, or through any of my Google Home or Echo assistants. I was unable to change any routines, and essentially, the switches in the wall, and the smart plug were very expensive standard units.\n\nI tried searching forums, following the instructions meticulously, but to no avail. Meanwhile, the dozen or so other smart devices I have in my home connect to my network seamlessly and without issue, an expected result considering the significant upgrade.\n\nI contacted WeMo customer support initially December of last year. And was escalated through the levels up to their highest support tier, where the best instructions I received were: let's reset the units, reset the app, and see how if they connect. I spent upwards of 15 hours between the support tiers, troubleshooting the connectivity issue without a single change.\n\nUltimately, I was offered a refund on my units, in February of this year, by the WeMo representative. Yet, here we are today, in April, and though I call back on a weekly basis, I have not gotten a response yet past, we are reviewing the case and are awaiting a decision.\n\nI would be very hesitant to purchase these items if you have any plans of upgrading your wireless network. I came across my issue on other forums and found the results of other consumers to be hit and miss, with some successfully able to correct the problems and others in my same predicament, out a significant amount of money on a product that did not perform its basic functions as expected."}

So basically, if you want to say, \"set all the lights to 20%\", you CAN'T. Nope, not allowed, instead, you can have the luxury of saying \"Set Dimmer A to 20%, set Dimmer B to 20%, set Dimmer C to 20%, set.. .f** it I'm just gonna go over to the wall and set them myself and wonder why I needed wifi lights in the first place if I have recite a novel every time I want to set the lights levels."}

I own 7 WeMo devices: 2 dimmers, 3 switch, 4 plugs. Belkin support website was not super helpful. Hope these tips below help you out.\n\nISSUE 1: KRACK vulnerability firmware update\n-This wreaked COMPLETE havoc on my WeMo setup. This *almost* made me rip out all the plugs and devices. It made remote control unusable.\n-Plugs updated firmware across 2 weeks. I had to 'hard-reset' ALL DEVICES after each time update a single device updated.\n-When going through setup, repeatedly got the infamous \"Password invalid\" when connecting to WiFi. It is NOT you. You are typing in the password correctly. I tried both Android and iOS phones to setup my devices. The solution? Try again in a couple hours. Magic.\n\nISSUE 2: Migrating to a new router and 'multicast nightmare'\nAfter the KRACK debacle I got my setup stable again. Then, I had to replace my router. I haven't figured out which was responsible, but I had to reboot my router almost daily:\n*HomeKit/AirPrint/Bonjour was usable for only an hour after a reboot\n*WeMo App would always show as 'Not Connected' when connected to same WiFi. Sometimes work if I use over LTE-only.\n\nHow I Fixed:\n- Belkin says \"Don't use same WiFi name. It's true, WeMo doesn't like same WiFi name from 2 different routers\"\n- On Asus Router:\n--- Enable Enable IGMP Snooping for 2.4G and 5G wireless\n--- Optimized for XBox / BG Protection\n--- Set 2.4G 'Control Channel' to '11'\n\nISSUE 3: One of Wemo Mini Smart Plugs have died after 4 months. I used it for a water kettle rated at 1000w. The Smart Plug is supposed to handle 1800w. Going to have to reach out to Belkin support."}

Wemo replaced the switch again for this problem but the replacement switch has the same problem. I can run through the bulb type setup and it dims and brightens without flickering for a while but eventually the lights end up flickering again. Wemo suggested that maybe the light fixture I\u2019m using is not compatible but if that was the case, I would have had the same problem from the beginning. This is why I suspect a firmware update might be the cause. Anyway, I have to change my rating to 1 Star \u2b50\ufe0f.\n\nWhen we replaced our old fluorescent tube kitchen lights with LED lights we noticed how much brighter they are and figured we needed a dimmer. Since we already have a couple of other Wemo devices, we decided to get the Wemo dimmer switch for the kitchen.\nWe like the functionality it provides like being able to control the lights via Alexa and the Wemo app. Also nice that we can set up the Away mode for when we go out of town instead of hooking up a light timer to a lamp or something. The whole Wemo concept is great except that you have to purchase a separate device to get them to work with Apple's Homekit system. It's also great as long as the devices can maintain a consistent connection to the Internet.\n\nOur dimmer switch worked fine for a couple of months until the Wemo app (both on iOS and Android devices) could not connect to the dimmer switch intermittently. There was no error light flashing on the switch and it could still be operated manually, it just wouldn't respond to Alexa or the Wemo app. This started to get worse and worse to the point that the Wemo app couldn't connect to the dimmer more often than it could. We knew there wasn't anything wrong with our WiFi or the Wemo app because the other two Wemo devices continued to work fine. After trying everything I could do on my end (reboot, reconnect WiFi, reset everything) I called Belkin support. After over an hour talking to their support rep, who had me repeat everything I had already tried multiple times, they finally decided the dimmer was defective and they are sending out a replacement. But I have to pay return shipping even though it's under warranty and clearly a defective device (knocking off a star on this review for that).\n\nHoping this is just a fluke and the replacement switch will work longer than a couple of months."}

I integrated them with an amazon Echo dot", "Text": "I ordered 4 Wemo dimmer light switches after replacing all of our can light bulbs in our house with dimmable LEDs. The challenge which I knew ahead of time was my switches were 3-way and wemo specifically states they would not work with 3-way. I have done enough electrical work though to understand how three way switches work and how I could bypass the issue to make the switches work. I will give a brief explanation of this below.\n\nThey have been awesome! I integrated them with an amazon Echo dot. I can tell Alexa to turn them on/off, adjust them to a percentage of brightness I desire, I even enabled the night mode so they all automatically dim to 10% at a time of my choosing. Really great!\n\n3-way switch specifics - first thing you have to do is determine the dominant switch and the satellite switch. For mine, one location I wanted to install was the dominant and the other location was a satellite switch. Wire wise, there is the typical ground (copper) wire, the white ground wires, 2 black wires, and a red wire. I disconnected the red wire and capped it off. This one is the transfer wire that connects the switches. I connected the two black wires using a cap in the unused switch. In the location of installation, you need to use a tester to determine the \u201chot\u201d wire. Then wire them up according to the directions. Works like a charm. I just installed blank covers over the switches I was no longer using.\n\nReally happy with the setup and the product. Definitely recommend."}

I was keen to get the remote capability and the Alexa integration.\nSo far i've been modestly frustrated by the tendency of the device to lose it's connection with my network. The wifi signal is strong with the Netgear Orbi system being 15Ft away in the same room. This is inconvenient but tolerable.\nThe piece that simply doesn't work for me is the dimming capability. With the lutron dimmer there was a seemingly infinite graduation of brightness available to me but most critically, the lutron would allow me to configure the bottom level brightness for the system.\nThe Wemo on the other hand sets it's own minimum brightness threshold and the user can only configure this minimum level to be brighter, not dimmer. In my case this new baseline is much much brighter than what i had available with the lutron and it sets my media room lights at an unacceptably bright level for night time viewing.\nIn checking with wemo they advised that this level of user configurability is not available and so i could add it to the list of feature requests in the forum.\nI was hoping to use this system in my child's room as well but again, the minimum brightness is too high for the night time lighting i was hoping to achieve.\nAlexa control is nice but robust and configurable dimming control seems like a must have basic.

They don't make it clear that you have to leave the app and go to your Android Settings, to force your WiFi to connect to the WeMo during setup. Also, the Help is in the app, itself, so you have to keep switching back and forth between the Help section and the part of the app where you do the setup - very awkward. Overall, I had to go through the setup several times, even on my second install, before I could get it to work. And it was never clear what I was doing wrong.

My bigger issue is that app only correctly shows the light on/off status half the time. I use the insight on my bedroom light. It comes on automatically at a certain time (that works great). I manually turn it off when I'm snug in bed. But half the time, the app shows the light off. I tap the off button, it changes to on and then I tap again to turn the light off.

My one and only critical comment is that when directly attached to the light switch wifi during set up you are given some choices on bulb types etc and then led to believe you can change it later in the app. This turns out to not be true and to make adjustments to the bulb type etc you need to set the switch up again after clearing it. Not a huge deal but worth noting. Overall I could not be happier."}

What this means is that when I turn on my front door light, the SOB will automatically turn off every 10 minutes. Not fun when you're expecting company at night.\n\nHere is Wemo's support model: keep you in a never ending loop of troubleshooting until you get frustrated and go away. They'll never stop trying something, but they also don't have the know-how to fix an actual issue that isn't a simple one.\n\nI could go on and on about the issues (devices disappearing in the app, etc.) but I'm going to keep it short and simple - if you have time to kill, go ahead and buy a Wemo light switch.

I like the abilities of the WeMo app to set up rules as well as the long press function customization on the dimmer switches. However, because of the depth of the dimmer and the way these install, it is an extremely tight fit in the gang box. The 4 wires off the back of the dimmer have to be connected to your existing wiring with wire nuts. Between the extra wire and the wire nuts, you really have to jam the wiring into the back of the box to get the switch to fit correctly. I question how safe this really is. It would also be nice if these worked on 3 and 4 way configurations with multiple switches."}

I setup more than 10 smart devices from 3 other vendors and while they all wanted 2.4GHz networks, they just worked even in my mixed 2.4/5Ghz setup with same SSID.

I have 3 other manufactures (switches and outlets) and their lag time is less than a second and IFTTT says that those devices usually run in a \"few seconds\". For the Wemo plug, IFTTT expects it to \"runs usually within hour\". I am doing this in the wee hours of the morning, so response times could be worse during peak times.\n\nI did not try the other features like Alexa or Google Home integration and I have every expectation that it will be poor.

There are hundreds of comments on Amazon and in online forums talking about bugs with this product and the app used to set it up. It doesn't make sense to buy this and waste your time, especially when this many people have seen that this product does not work as expected.\n\nI'm honestly not sure how this is still rated as 4 stars on Amazon. I tried setting this up 15-20 times, tried different outlets, resetting the outlet most times, and trying to figure out any bugs that might be occurring. I consider myself close to an expert with technology. I do think I could have eventually got this working, but for the price this product should just work without resetting your wifi, changing your wifi password, rebooting the smart outlet, deleting and reinstalling the buggy Wemo app, turning your cellular data off on your phone and so on.\n\nI'm extremely disappointed because I've read some great reviews on this product, most specifically Wirecutter which rated it the best smart outlet (https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-smart-switch/). I have set up other smart outlets and will go back to other brands. For $30 per plug, I expected a much better setup experience and definitely expected to get this working, but that never happened."}

The missing step? \"Make sure that Mobile Data is turned off on all nearby mobile devices before configuring.\"\nWhen I installed my first Wemo I had to wait on hold over an hour to get through to somebody that told me this. The next Wemo installed fine because I remembered this. When I bought my third one, I remembered that there was a missing step but I couldn't recall what it was. I spent another hour on the phone with them, this time trying a lot of different things, before I realized that my wife's phone was nearby and had mobile data turned on. Ugh. Their support guy told me that this is a really common issue and most of their support calls that last more than a minute or two are due to this. Why can't they fix their instructions? Just add it to the troubleshooting steps online.\nThere's another setup caveat as well... Once it connects to your Wifi you have less than a minute to complete the next step or it will disconnect. In many cases that is not enough time so you might have to try it a few times to get it done quickly enough.\nAnyway, now you know; so it shouldn't be a problem for you."}

{"Author": "Noctaire", "Date": "on February 19, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Need that neutral wire....", "Text": "The typical home wiring set up has three wires - a black \u201chot\u201d wire, a white \u201cneutral\u201d wire, and a bare or green \u201cground wire\u201d. When wiring a switch, it typically interrupts the hot wire - switch off means the flow is interrupted; on and you complete the circuit. Older homes, that\u2019s the wire that is on the two screws of your switch. The white wire is either in the back of the box or maybe not there at all, depending upon how the light is wired up. Everything that uses power will need the hot and neutral wires to operate, butfor a switch, you only need to break the hot wire. Oversimplification, yes, but you get the gist.\n\nThis particular switch requires the neutral wire to work. That\u2019s a bit different from traditional switches and even other smart switches. As such, if the neutral wire is not accessible in the electrical box where the switch resides (as is often the case) then you cannot use this switch.\n\nNow...a caveat...the color of the wires isn\u2019t always the same. Case in point - some electricians (and laymen) may wire everything at the light, then break the hot wire there, connecting one end to the black wire and the other to the white wire, and run those down to the switch. This, in essence, turns the white wire at the switch into a hot wire as well. When you look at one of these installs, you will see just one gathered wire with three wires in the switch box (white, black, and usually bare). If you have a setup like that, you cannot use this switch - you\u2019ll need something like the Lutron Cas\u00e9ta wireless switch.\n\nLikewise, if you have a light controlled by more than one switch, this switch will not work with it. You\u2019ll want to consider the Lutron or another.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that this switch is designed like that. I did not realize when I purchased it that the normal/typical wiring in older homes would not have the neutral accessible at the switch box. (It\u2019s been a while since I wired a switch.). I\u2019d definitely recommend checking your old switch\u2019s wiring BEFORE you buy. The other Wemo equipment is nice but this switch...not gonna work in my setup."}

The app itself is slow, hangs frequently with no way to back out without closing and re-opening the app. The app is terribly broken when setting up a device.\n\nI want to expand on that last point. Android devices don't like to be attached to networks that don't have internet connectivity, and in many versions of Android the user can't prevent the phone from disconnecting from a network that doesn't have internet. The setup process for these switches, and presumably the entire Wemo line, requires connecting to the device's own WiFI network, which of course has no internet access. When the app sees that the network has disconnected, rather than either waiting to see what the phone does, or telling the user to switch back, the app closes and re-opens, starting the already slow process over again. Because of this there is a good chance the user will never be able to setup the device.\n\nI tried to reset the device because it doesn't do anything with the rules set for it 95% of the time. I had a simple rule, when I'm home, based on Nest, and the time is after 6PM turn on the light, but this only worked a few times in the three months I've had it. Frustrated with this, and not being able to connect the Wemo to Google Home due to an error with no explanation from the Wemo site, I reset it and had to deal with the issue above again.\n\nIt's going in the trash if Amazon won't give a refund. I wish I knew what to recommend instead. I'm going to shop for an alternative, and if I don't find one it is trivial to do with an Arduino or Raspberry Pi for anyone that has the knowledge to do so.\n\nI would definitely recommend against this, especially for people who use the Android ecosystem or Google Home. I don't have an iOS device, so I don't know if they also dislike being connected to WiFi without internet, but I would guess they have similar behavior."}

If you are using Alexa to turn them on, sometimes they just work, but I have had a few that took over night to show up on Alexa. No idea why. Could show up in 10 minutes, hour or over night. Once it does I never had one fail in 3 years. only shitty thing is you can ONLY have one location of wemo's on one device. So I have 2 houses, have to have two iphones.

I have two of these, one of the older (bulkier) plugs, and three Wemo light switches - I am taking them all out and introducing them to the trash can! You cannot set them up with newer versions of Android - luckily I had one of my old phones that I could use to initially set them up - my Pixel 2 XL would not set them up after hours of tring. The app can be slow and unresponsive. Switches and plugs will be disabled in the app randomly, the app will say something is turned on when it is off, sometimes when you try to use the app to turn something on/off it will \"spin\" for several seconds and not change state. If you can ever get them set up and tied into your Google Assistant they work a little better than they do through the native Android app - assuming Google Assistant can actually see the devices. I changed my WiFi access point a week or so ago and these two smart plugs have not worked since. They are set up (again, using an old Android phone that I have not gotten rid of yet) and the app can \"see them\" but so far nothing can control them.\n\nI have read several posts on the Wemo message board with others having similar trouble so others are having similar troubles.

A few weeks ago I updated my router for improved performance and security. I have about two dozen smart devices in my home and I was able to connect all of them to my new router with little fuss, that is, with the exception of the two WeMo Smart Plugs. I worked for hours doing research and doing troubleshooting with success. I called WeMo (Belkin) Tech Support who spent a 1-2 hours with me on the phone. When the plugs didn't work using my phone as a hot spot to eliminate the new router it was determined that both devices were defective. Given an RMA # I paid the postage to return the devices for new ones. When the replacements arrived I still wasn't able to get them to connect to my Wi-Fi router. I sent an email with my case number to support explaining that the problems I was experiencing. They called me back in a timely manner and we spent two hours on the phone doing troubleshooting. We were able to get the WeMos connected using my phone as a Mobile Hotspot and was even able to do a firmware update. Still no luck connecting with my Wi-Fi router. I understand this will be escalated but after spending so many hours without any results I am pretty soured on the devices. Tech Support was pretty good although a bit difficult to understand but the product is a disappointment. I have much cheaper smart plugs from another OEM that have always worked well and easily migrated to the new router using their app; just selected the new router, entered the password and was done. I do not recommend these smart plugs.\n\nUpdate 2/15/2018: So WeMo Tech Support quickly responded to my follow-up email about the problems I was having with the replacement devices. The problem had been escalated and it was determined that the reason the WeMo Minis couldn't connect to my WiFI was because there was a special character in the SSID of the router!!! The SSID was valid and posed no problems for any of the two dozen or so devices that use WiFi. I selected WeMo (Belkin) because I perceived them to be a big player and have had good experiences previously. I am astounded that any device they would produce would have such a basic and simple flaw that would prevent it from working. Moreover, even with the flaw, it should not take me hours on the phone with tech support before finding the problem. Apparently they were aware of the problem and working on a firmware update to fix it. So add that to the tech support script and include a notice in the packaging for the Mini. The problem is that it is inconceivable that something as simple as special (and permissible) characters in an otherwise valid SSID would not work properly. It speaks volumes about the lack of quality control and testing of their firmware. I'll keep these WeMos but no more Wemo/Belkin wireless products for me.\n\nAnother Update 2/15/2018: OK so I changed my SSID and did all of the other things WeMo support said needed to be done and the two Minis worked for a few minutes. When I took them upstairs to use them they would not connect!!! I brought the one I was trying to use and went through the whole setup process again 4-5 times and couldn't get the device to reconnect. I plugged in the second WeMo that was only in my pocket to go up and it wouldn't connect. Basically all I did was walk upstairs with it in my pocket, bring it back down and restarted the WeMo app. I am about beside myself about these things. I reset 4 Echo Dots, 2 Ecobee thermostats and 3 other smart switches in about 10 minutes before I got to trying to use the WeMos for the last hour!! I need to go reconnect everything else with the new SSID but I am done with the WeMos. They are garbage!!!! I might hang on to them to see if there is ever a firmware version that will actually work since I spent about $60 on them but then maybe not - need to sleep on it."}

In trying to install it on the Wemo app it would not install. In fact I deleted my app and started to see if that would fix it. A mistake as now all three wemo mini switches failed to work ! A call to support (who are very good and based in the Philipines) determined that the firmware was out of date on my old wemo switches. These were updated and still no joy. The new wemo was returned to Amazon as faulty and replaced (super service). The new wemo arrives and I contact support for another attempt at getting these wemo\u2019s installed. After well over an hour of resetting the switches and deleting and reinstalling apps on both an iPad and iPhone still no joy. So I was upgraded to higher support who would call the next day. Next day and after creating a WiFi hotspot and upgrading the firmware ,the switches would install when connected to this WiFi hotspot that was created on my PC, however the wemo switches would still not install using my router WiFi ! It was suggested that I use another password on my router but I explained that I had numerous devices attached and didn\u2019t really want to change my password, after all it had worked well with my old wemo switches! After some discussion and this was after over two hours approx on a support call I was asked about my password. When I explained it contained a symbol I was told the wemo switch WOULD NOT connect to a router password that contained a symbol !!! (my old switches prior to firmware update had worked to this password !!). The support agent (who was very patient and helpful) then arranged for a support call to me the following day at 9am and if not called that day, a call for the following day at 9am to see if there was a workaround for my password.

I use Alexa for both voice controls and routines to control these devices. I also have Philips Hue lights, Ring, Magic Home, ARLO, Harmony, FireTV stick, TP-Link, Sengled smart bulbs etc. Needles to say, I have a bunch of $$ invested in smart home. Well, recently I not only see my WEMO devices in Alexa but over 60 other WEMO devices which are not mine. This has broken control of my smart switches and plugs because these other devices have the same names as my devices, I call my kitchen lights \"kitchen\" and someone else calls their kitchen lights \"kitchen\". Alexa can't control them because there are multiple \"kitchens\". So, voice control and routines won't work. I spent several hours deleting/reinstalling apps, deleting/reinstalling devices, etc. But as soon as I \"discover devices\" they are all back.\n\nAnother worrisome issue is that my light and other devices go on or off, it seems, randomly. I discovered that I not only \"see\" these other devices but, I can actually turn them on or off!. So other people can turn my devices on or off. I was quite startled when my fireplace came on by itself.\n\nAfter a lengthy call with WEMO tech support they said they don't know what is causing this but they have received other calls with the same problem. I was given a case number and was told to expect a call back within 48 hours.\n\nThis is totally unacceptable. 1) This is dangerous, if other people can turn on my fireplace or coffee pot when I'm not around serious damage, and possible injury could occur. 2) The fact that my information is co-mingled with other's is troubling. 3) WEMO has my email, they should send out an email alerting us to this problem.\n\nFor my money, I will purchase TP-Link products, they are far less expensive and I have had no issues with their light switches."}

I wanted to expand on my smart house set up and preferred to stay with Wemo to avoid another interface and go with a brand I had previous experience with. I have to say, what a MISTAKE! I\u2019ve never had such an issue or so much frustration from a product that really should not be relatively straightforward! The set up seems very simple yet I spent hours trying to get this operational and it just would not connect to my network. I read a helpful review here that I needed to unplug my older style Wemo plug. So after hours of annoyance, I tried this and it immediately worked. Unfortunately, I had to move it to another outlet (literally just 2 minutes later) and it could no longer be detected. I tried to repeat the set up, reset to factory settings about 30 times and still no luck. I finally called tech support. I spent almost 2 HOURS on the phone with them and got no where! In fact the steps their tech support told me to take caused my older Wemo plug and light switch completely disappear from my app \u2014 to the point it looked like I had just installed their app. The support agent was no longer able to help and had to escalate to level 2 - telling me I will get a call in 24-48 hours. I spent another hour trying to get my devices back and while i see them now, they still show not detected about every other time I login. Bottom line, this product lacks quality and a stable and mature software to support it. Their support, while they tried, was not much help. It is absolutely not worth the frustration and as a previous Wemo customer, I am super disappointed. I returned the newer plug to Amazon, and won\u2019t be buying ANY Wemo products again."}

I'm a quadriplegic or paralyzed from the chest down. I cannot move anything below my chest, I have very limited arm and wrist movement and zero use of my fingers. Needless to say, my quality of life is severely affected when things I depend on do not work correctly. My house is full of smart products, thermostat, door locks, outlet plugs, light switches, irrigation, theater system, alarm system, cameras, etc. I use hubs from Apple Home Kit, Smartthings, Simple Control, Wink, Arlo, Amazon Echo, etc. I've tried hundreds of products over the past 10 yrs in an attempt to make my life easier and the most disappointing are my wemo products. Do not get me wrong, I've used much worse products, but those experiences have been cut and dry, works or doesn't work. Wemo is different, they look good, are easy to set up, have many features and work with most voice activated platforms. When they work (and they do 90% of the time) everything is beautiful but working 9 out of 10 times is useless to me. There have been too many times when I needed them to work when they don\u2019t. At any given point, all my wemo products just disappear, I have 15 light switches and 2 plugs. They just stop working for no reason. Most of the time, this is a simple fix. Go around and restart each one with a push of a button and that normal fixes them all within a few minutes. On occasion you have to reset them to factory setting and reinstall them, but this is a quick fix too. If you decide to buy Wemo, don\u2019t worry, you will eventually be able to do both procedures sleepwalking. After doing it 100 times, it becomes 2nd nature. If I was able to reset them myself, it would not be so bad, but I must rely on my wife since I\u2019m physically unable and that will get old fast. I\u2019ve tried every solution possible, updated firmware, install/reinstall, static ip/mac id, optimal wireless channels, etc. None work and nothing you do will fix the issue completely. I have almost fixed the problem many times only to have them reappear, days, weeks or months in the future. It is a known bug and Wemo has no idea how to fix it. I\u2019ve spent countless hours on the phone with support, years searching the internet, reading articles from tech support and user forums and nothing has worked. Now I\u2019m stuck with $500 worth of junk and weeks of wasted time I\u2019ll never get back."}

Apparently I had a plug that was sitting on a shelf for a long time, but I just ordered it from Amazon. The app now can turn the light on and off. But I would like to do more, so I tried to set up a schedule to turn the plug on and off at a certain time. What a nightmare! The app has one of the worst user interfaces imaginable, but that would not be so bad if it didn't freeze up all the time. I can't tell you how many times I had to force stop and restart trying to do this. After an hour of this I simply gave up. Right now I am staring at the app, with its spinning icon \"Looking for Rules\" screen, even though I did manage to set up a turn on rule.

Sometimes the automation or commands don't work, either because of random loss of wifi connection to my router, because IFTTT is having server problems, or some other random reason that may as well be ghosts. I can always manually turn the switch on or off on the hardware, though, so I'm not stuck when things go astray.\n\nWould be 5 stars if I didn't have to rely on IFTTT to get these to work with Google Home, but the upside is that I can have the Google AI respond with any phrase of my choosing when confirming commands."}

In my experience, most switches don't require the extra \"white\" constant power line. It's fine that this switch does, but it might cause hesitation in someone who has not used all four wires in a switch before.\n\nThe great benefit of these switches and smart power supply switches is their simplicity. This switch is fine, but more complicated than most random other switches. If you don't need the functionality of a smart switch, this is a waste, even a hinderance.\n\nMy other small complaint is this switch occasionally looses signal. It is near my router, and installed correctly, in a bay which only houses it, but it just occasionally disconnects. It's rare enough, it has never caused any trouble for me, but assuming it is the fault of the switch, it could be a problem for some."}

{"Author": "theboilermaker48", "Date": "on January 23, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Easy 3-Way Circuit Installation", "Text": "While the paperwork says it is \"Not compatible with 3-way (multi location control) switches\", we used a little engineering logic and got it installed in our kitchen 3-way light circuit (2 switches). When we opened the electrical box in the wall where we want to install the Wemo, and we saw the Romex circuit jacket with Red, White, Black, and Green/bare wires coming up thru the bottom of the box. Then we saw another set of White, Black, and Green/bare going up through the box to the overhead ceiling light circuit.\n\nSo, obviously we connected all the Green/bare wires together. Connected all the White wires together. Now here was the tricky part. The bottom circuit has the traditional hot Black wire, and a second control Red wire coming from the other 3-way switch across the kitchen room. Since the Red wire is really controlling the ON-OFF power between the two existing kitchen switches, it was logical to assume this Red wire was a Hot Power wire (just like the Black) from the other kitchen switch. The Wemo has 2 Black wires to connect to. One is the power IN, and the other is power OUT--as per the instructions, it makes no difference which one we connected to (nice). So we connected the Red control wire to one of the Wemo Black wires, and then connected the other Wemo Black wire to the two existing Black wires in the wall box (remember: one hot Black is coming from the other kitchen switch and the other hot Black is going up to the lights in the ceiling. ). We connected all 3 Black wires together---at first kind of strange, but think about it: we wanted power on all the time, and let Alexa control the On-Off function. Sure enough, the unit worked.\n\nHere is the downside. As long as the other 3-way kitchen switch is OFF, Alexa and Wemo work just fine. The good news is, we can still manually turn On-n-Off the light circuit with the other kitchen switch (old habits are hard to die)---but when we do that, it kills the power to the new Wemo switch and Alexa does cannot find it to control it. But we just have to get used to using Alexa, and keep the other regular 3-way kitchen switch in the 'off' position---pretty simple.\n\nThe one complaint we have is that we had to go thru a double WiFi process. Unlike the Phillps Hue light bulbs, where Alexa recognizes the light bulb within the Alexa phone app Smart Home/Add Device commands (nice-n-easy/simple 1-2-3)-----another new Wemo App must be downloaded, then use this new App to search for the Wemo wifi using your phone Settings Wifi routine, then pair with the Wemo wifi, then update the Wemo software (it asked me if we wanted to update to the current version--obviously yes), and once it is paired with the Wemo wifi, we had to go back to the Alexa App and do the Smart Home/Add Device search to find the Wemo Switch. Sure wish these other 3rd party manufacturers figure out how Phillips Hue did it, and install the same chips, etc in their products, thus avoiding the added Wemo App work. If I asked any of my other family members to do this installation, their eye balls would just fall out---it was tough enough to get the family trained to just do a simple telephone Settings/Wifi search when we go to other friends homes, let alone a double process for this Wemo product. Please make it simple plug-n-play.\n\nNow that we have gone thru the PITA APP process, we will buy more to install, as we are very satisfied with the product performance."}

After about 10 tries, the app somehow crashed into a screen where the switch was listed, but alas, not connected (?). Wifi signal is strong, no metal plate, no excuses, this thing is horrible. Will most certainly return this to my friend and stick to Tp-Link brand smart products."}

{"Author": "Xhynk", "Date": "on January 19, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "The best looking dimmer on the market, very easy and intuitive to use.", "Text": "To address some concerns I see, this switch does not seem to disconnect any more often than any of my other devices, which includes a huge array of providers (LIFX bulbs, TP-Link bulb, TP-Link outlet, iHome Control outlet, Magic Home LED, SmartThings hub, etc.)\n\nIt is a bit frustrating when it disconnects, but the same with any of my other devices, so I can't hold that against WeMo/Belkin at all.\n\nThe other big con I have is that the other WeMo devices have SmartThings, but the dimmer switch doesn't. It's one of the biggest reasons I only have one of them on the main light and not on every one in the house. It's still quasi-automated with IFTTT, but it's a bit of a pain.\n\nAlso a con (but not for me) is that it doesn't work with 3-way switches (where one light is controlled by multiple switches). My house doesn't have any of those, so it's a non-issue for me.\n\nNow for the pros: This is 110% absolutely the BEST looking dimmer switch on the market, by an enormous margin. Most of the other dimmers look like hot garbage with random buttons/levers strewn about, or the standard paddle with a thumbnail slider on the side. This one looks and feels like Tesla of in-wall dimmers.\n\nIt's very easy to install, almost couldn't be easier. I've wired in outlets and switches before, but they really make this a \"light switch for dummies\", with the stickers and color coded leads, I'd be surprised if most people couldn't install it themselves with little prior knowledge.\n\nIt's also very very intuitive to use in my opinion. Click pretty much anywhere on the bottom half of the switch to turn it on. If it's on and you slide your finger up and down, it will brighten and dim. If it's off and you slide your finger, it will set the level that it *will* turn on to when you click it. It also shows a tiny dim light showing what level the light was last on/will turn on to when it gets turned on. Takes about 10 seconds to get used to, and you'll spend about 10 minutes sliding your finger on it, at least I did...\n\nIt also becomes a conversation piece because of how sleek it looks.\n\nUsing the app, IFTTT, etc you can program some really cool features into it. The \"pretend someone is home/nighttime mode\" is neat, but a little basic for what I wanted. I've got some more recipes through IFTTT that give me more control over that kind of thing, including toggling it on/off when motion detectors are triggered.\n\nYou can even set it to dim after a certain time (like midnight) so when you turn it on late at night you don't blind yourself because you left it at 100% when you last turned it off.\n\nI got mine for $50 at Best Buy, and I would absolutely LOVE to get more, but I'll wait until there's a sale. However if they introduce SmartThings support (even with SmartThings Labs), I'll absolutely buy more at the full price.\n\nedit: I've seen some people say things about the profile of it messing up their multi-gang covers, the one I have installed is in a 2-gang box with a standard switch/slider dimmer next to it and it looks great and doesn't mess with the 2-gang cover at all."}

However, the Wemo dimmers pretty much drop off whenever they feel like it. I've updated firmware and done just about everything tech support and Google suggests (Static DHCP, AES/TKIP, Channel changes), yet when sending an Alexa command these will respond about 70% of the time, sometimes taking up to a minute to actually respond to the command. The Lausateks respond every single time. If anyone else had a better wifi dimmer solution at <$70 I'd send these puppies back in a heartbeat.\n\nAlso, the LED ring is very bright at night in a bedroom setting... for $70 I'd like to be able to have control of the ring and for that matter the colored light bar as well...

It is easy enough to install, too - especially if you already have experience with other WiFi enabled devices and Echo/Alexa. The app is fairly intuitive; setting up schedules is a breeze.\n\nMy only complaint (or suggestion, really) is that the app should allow you to \"batch\" multiple plugs together with the Echo/Alexa - similar to how you can batch them in the app's scheduling feature. I purchased a bunch of these, and two of them are specifically controlling lamps at either end of a couch. However, each lamp is plugged into a different Wemo Smart Plug, so I have to name them separately and call out two commands to Alexa, instead of just one. It would be far more fluid to just say \"Alexa, turn on the living room lamps\" than \"Alexa, turn on the living room lamp\" and \"Alexa, turn on living room lamp 2\". It's possible this feature is accessible and I've just missed it, but I don't think that's the case. Happy to be wrong on that, though."}

I selected this Wemo over the other smart plugs for a couple of reasons: 1) It only takes up one plug on the outlet (larger smart plugs take up the entire outlet yet only provide for one outlet) and 2) It doesn't require a separate hub to work with either my phone or Alexa.\n\nI purchased two and went to work setting them up around the house. One design flaw of all of these smart plugs, including this one, is that they plug in the front instead of the side, top or bottom. This makes the plug long a bit clunky to hide behind furniture. One way around this is to pair the plug with a Flat Plug extension cord to make things a little thinner if you're installing behind a piece of furniture.\n\nSetup is simple. After you download the app, connect to the ad-hoc wifi to then connect the smart plug to your network. Then, simply name the plug and then associate it with Alexa. There's no separate hub that is required to make the lights work and the app doesn't carry a fee to use it. My favorite feature is \"Away Mode\", which allows the lights to turn on and off on schedule like an old fashioned timer. Also, unlike a timer, the switch can be bypassed by pressing the button on the outlet if talking to Alexa isn't opportune or your phone isn't nearby.\n\nWhile I wouldn't hook something high wattage up to anything I couldn't personally monitor, I do trust this plug to turn the lights on and off in the house as requested without issue. With that being said, I'm ordering more plugs to expand the capability."}

In operation, these are handy for lamps that don\u2019t take conventional IoT (smart) light bulbs. But in practice, they have been less than reliable.\n\nProblems:\n\nFirmware. After setting up two new switches, I was prompted to update the firmware. This went fine. When I installed an additional two switches, the app prompted for an update, then the dialog disappeared. There is no way in the app to manually check for new firmware, you simply have to wait a few weeks for the app to check on its own. This is a major flaw, and the topic of long-time complaints on the Belkin support forums, one that Belkin refuses to answer for over a year.\n\nSoftware app. The app for iOS and Android is antiquated, rudimentary. Some functions continually refused to function, e.g. enabling remote access, saving rules. On iOS it is only identified as supporting iPhone, and uses the smaller resolution. Users might want to use an iPad to control more than 2-4 switches in their home!\n\nCloud support. Several times the Google Home app has been unable to reach the switches. On one occasion, Belkin\u2019s cloud went down while they patched servers for the Intel, and operation of the switches in Home was broken. Connectivity in the Wemo app also broke. In this case, you have to manually touch the switches\u2019 button, or just not use them. Unacceptable. I\u2019ve also found problems connecting to switches during normal use. Google Home will say it\u2019s unable to reach the device, but 20 seconds later the switch will obey the Home command. My home and switches are all on the same network, so apparently the devices don\u2019t support a point-to-point connection, but must operate through the cloud, a major flaw.\n\nDelays. Google Home control of my Wiz light bulbs is near-instantaneous. Wemo control takes from a few seconds to less than a minute, seemingly due to Belkin cloud delays. It\u2019s a great convenience to tell the Home to switch a lamp on or off before I enter that room, but when there\u2019s a 10-15 second delay while Google Home tries to reach the switch, it becomes an annoyance. At times, I enter a room, tell the Google Home in that room to turn on the lamp, and there\u2019s a 15 second delay before replying \u201cthat device appears to be offline.\u201d (I\u2019ve visually determined it\u2019s online, and even see it available in the Wemo app.) This is beyond ridiculous.\n\nIn summation, I may continue to use these as they were a bargain. But I\u2019m eyeing the TP-Link switches at a nearly comparable price from a local big box store. User reviews indicate they are far more reliable. If the delays to respond, or the dreaded \u201cthat device appears offline,\u201d they\u2019re going back to the store."}

Other times, remote access will just disable itself, and refuse to re-enable, causing issues with the Google Assistant. Let's also not forget to mention that the app is the slowest of the the three smart home apps that I've had to deal with, I mean seriously, the Android App will have you asking questions all over, as to why it was designed/implemented the way it was. Lastly, be aware that the wemo app has no login (username/password) system in place, in contrast to some other systems and their apps. Yes it may be a bit more convenient to not have to deal with another user account, but I've noticed that having a user account in place tends to result in greater reliability for smart plugs, especially when it comes to remote access control for the plugs/switches. Also, I'm here only referring to the wemo Android App, I've read some other accounts by others, of having greater success and reliability through the ios app, so I'd best suggest buying it and trying out to see how it works out for you."}

I contacted customer service and they were not helpful. They gave general advice amounting to \"hmm, that's odd, it should work. Check your router\".\n\nDoing my own research online, other owners were complaining that a recent firmware update broke the devices. I brought this to customer service's attention, but was met with confusion. They hadn't heard anything like that. I got a replacement item just in case my first one was a lemon. Funny enough, when I finally decided to test out the replacement, I saw both items were eligible for a firmware update on my app. I only updated the first one, and it started working. I tested out the second one without the update and it of course kept failing. Only after I updated that one as well did it start working.\n\nSo, these things work. They are a little bulky, and it makes it hard, if not impossible, to plug in something below it. But it works. It's still losing a few stars because of the poor customer service. Don't send out a terrible firmware update that breaks your device. If you do, be aware of it and tell customers you will fix it soon. Then fix it soon. Simple stuff.\n\n--------------------------------------------\nKeeps disconnecting from my wifi, which is a strong signal that works well with every other product I own.

The level of integration with the WeMo products and other services is absolutely fantastic - no other smart home/home automation products out there have this same level of compatibility. And that compatibility doesn't stop with just official products like Echos, Google Homes, and Cortana, but there's a large third party market for controlling WeMo devices too. Speaking specifically for my home, powered by Google Home, I can even group various switches in a room through the Google Home app and say \"Hey Google, turn on all living room lights\" and all of the lights that I set up for the living room with the word \"light\" in their WeMo description will turn on. It's very particular to the names set up in the WeMo app, as I also have a ceiling fan in my living room rigged up to a switch and that \"turn on all living room lights\" command won't turn that on because it's set up as \"Ceiling Fan\" in my WeMo app instead of \"Ceiling Fan Light\" (was quite the discovery). Through the WeMo app, I can even set these Switches on a schedule to turn things on or off at a specific time - so I don't have to remember to turn my outdoor garage lights or outdoor Christmas lights on and off all of the time, a schedule can do it for me! So much handier than working with plug timers!\nInstallation of the Plugs are a breeze - just plug it in - but there are certain applications where you might still want to use a switch on a wall instead of having to use the WeMo app all of the time, which is where I would recommend the Light Switches. The Light Switches are a little involved with regards to installation, but the included instructions are very helpful. It doesn't take an electrician to install these unless you're missing a neutral power line, which older homes may be missing. There are plenty of YouTube videos out there for installing these if you're feeling slightly intimidated by the process. But then once everything is plugged in, it's a matter of hooking a smartphone or tablet to the WiFi that the device is emitting, running the WeMo app, and following the on-screen instructions. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get the switch set up through the app, but just be patient and know that retrying is as simple as disconnecting from the switch, reconnecting again, and running the app again - easy peezy.\nI strongly recommend these to any home automation enthusiast!"}

Simple tasks, like changing the time, require a truly absurd amount of clicking and back-and-forth navigation. Also, a simple little card in the box guiding me through the initial setup would have been nice; Belkin expects this device to be intuitive and it's not.\n\nOnce I did get it set up, it worked as advertised; the plug went on at the right time, and off at the right time.

Highly recommend for anyone prone to forgetting to turn dangerous items off, or for anyone who wants to control of lights and other items with their phone from anywhere.\n\nYou can set it to turn on/off based on your phone gps location (home or away), turn on/off based on a timer, or simply control whenever you want with on/off switch on your phone and on the side of the plug."}

And once they start blinking amber/lose connectivity, I have to physically unplug them to get them back on the network for another couple of hours.\n\nThe firmware update process with the iOS app is poorly implemented. If the initial notification or update process fails, you have to reinstall the app to get the update firmware prompt again. And it doesn't have a good way to check if there\u2019s a newer firmware available if you missed the one time notification.\n\nPeople online did mentioned my reliability issue could be WiFi related. There are a lot of neighbors near me using up the 2.4GHz spectrum. I did try manually changing to some of the less congested channels without any luck. For reference, none of my other WiFi smart home devices have any issues with connectivity (Nest, Echo, Fitbit Aria, Hello Sense). And if this was really the issue, the WeMo should really have an automated retry procedure instead of requiring a physical power cycle.\n\nI definitely do not recommend this product due to WeMo\u2019s poor connectivity reliability and poorly implemented software and firmware."}

I have several outlets and switches by TP link, which have all worked flawlessly, but I was especially excited about this WeMo model because of the dimming feature. My wife picked it up for me this year for Christmas, and I installed it shortly after, hoping to be able to dim our light when changing our newborn in the middle of the night.\n\nThe good: The hardware is nice, the touch control is accurate, and the switch itself was easy enough to install. The switch is attractive with a nice looking light on the bottom, and the dimming panel looks cool and futuristic.The switch works really well from the WeMo app, and well when controlled manually from the wall.\n\nThe bad: it\u2019s struggles when commands are given by Alexa. I have several Wi-Fi outlets and switches by TP link and they work flawlessly with Alexa. This switch has a strong wifi signal, and the latest firmware installed, but Alexa often finds that the \"Belkin Wemo Dimmer\" is offline. Since I am able to control the switch without any issue from the WeMo app, this tells me that there is a bug with Wemo's Alexa skill.\n\nI have read through the WeMo support forums, and this issue is common for this model. Most people are told to call support, but have reported bad experiences.\n\nI will be returning this switch, as currently it is just a really expensive dimmer, costing more than double than that of a standard Lutron or Leviton dimmer, but with the added app-control functionality. It appears as though more wifi dimmers have entered the market which boast better reliability. I will be pursuing these."}

You can toggle devices on and off through the app, both on your LAN and remotely, or physically press the button on the device. They have stayed connected to my wifi now for a couple weeks ago with no unintended disconnects.\n\nYou can also set it up to work with voice commands via Google Home units or Amazon Echo & Alexa, and I have found that works very well. The Google app seems more reliable; I have had a few occasions where Alexa could not communicate with the device where Google could. Overall, very happy with the performance. You can also set up timers and schedules, so it's pretty versatile.\n\nThe app also has an option to associate it with your Nest account so you can make thermostat changes within the WEMO app, or sync your switches to shut off when the thermostat is in \"away\" mode.

Dont buy unless your comfortable with strangers controlling your devices!", "Text": "I bought the Wemo dimmer because it got 4 stars on amazon. I should have done my research elsewhere. The dimmer has a serious security flaw. The dimmer looks great and works great as a dumb switch. As soon as you connect it to its app and your wifi is where all the strange and serious things come into play.\n\nI installed the app and connected it to my wifi. It immediately told me it needed a firmware update. I let it update and then set up my switch. I noticed after the set up that I had 96 users on my remote access. Strange? I looked at them and noticed they were random peoples ipads, iphones and other devices. ex. Bob's iPad, Ed's iPhone, etc. I even had one device written in Chinese. I then proceeded to allow Alexa to control the switch. I then suddenly had 96 additional devices on my Alexa app! Whooa!! These devices have names like Ed's light, florida garage, Christmas tree, kitchen light, etc. They appeared to be other peoples switches personally named by them. They all were wemo switches. The scary part is Alexa allowed me to activate and deactivate the switches! I immediately got online and did a quick search on this problem. I found out it wasn't just me this happened to. I then called wemo. I got a tech that could barely speak English(no surprise there). She walked me through uninstalling the app and reinstalling, which did nothing. She confirmed I had the latest firmware. She could not figure out what was wrong and told me this was a rare situation, which I knew wasn't true from the search I did prior to calling wemo. Finally, she gave up and told me I had to talk to their second tier tech department which would call me in 24-48 hours. She said they would have to remove the other 96 users separately. She then asked me if I had any other questions or concerns. I told her yes, my concern is if someone else can control my light from their device! She assured me with a giggle, that no one else could control my light. I hung up with her and turned off the remote access on my wemo app.\n\nThe next day I am sitting in the room with the wemo switch. The light is on dim and it brightens up on its own. I turned it back down and a couple minutes go by and it does it again. That did it! This switch has to go. Do I know if someone else is controlling my switch for sure? No, but it sure doesn't inspire confidence in the wemo app and this switch. I promptly removed the switch from the wall and boxed it back up. I'm not even wasting my time talking to the tier 2 tech department and removing the 96 users that I can control, not to mention that wouldn't fix the problem of someone else CONTROLLING my switch.

But that has not been the case when trying to use them with Amazon's Echo \"Alexa\". I frequently (more than half the time) get a failure when they are asked to turn on/off by Alexa. The Echo just reports back that the the WeMo Skill is not responding. I suspect that the problem is simply a software bug in the WeMo skill used by the Echo. If the Dimmer is part of a group the response back when the dimmer fails (50% of the time) from the echo is \"I'm not sure what went wrong\".\n\nMy conclusion is that the WeMo Skill is flawed. The bottom line is that I think a person should move slowing with incorporating the WeMo dimmers into their home collection of smart devices to insure the WeMo Dimmer's performance is acceptable given the expense of this product."}

A friend convinced me to give WeMo another try, so I did.\n\nLong story short, after a lot of trial and error I finally figured out that the VPN on my iPhone 6 was apparently preventing the WeMo app from progressing any further than it did. After temporarily disabling the VPN, everything worked like it was supposed to, the setup was easy and easily linked to Alexa.\n\nI am now a happy smart home owner, and I would have given this 5 stars for these smart plugs but for all the trouble I had initially that I had to figure out for myself.

Having other brands (Tp Link and ecobee) already installed I wanted to keep the same so I don't have yet another app on my phone to set away settings and sync to alexa. I spent 4+ hrs trying to get these to work (I got a 2 pack from Costco) after resetting everything (router, plugs, app, closer to router, wifi networks, etc) with no luck. I gave up and got another brands plugs that were up and running from nothing in 5 min that were close to half the cost. I had similar issues with the wemo light switch compared to Tp Link as well.\n\nI've heard the customer support here is good, but if I can't easily add on products without a customer service call, this won't work for me.\n\nIf this is your first Alexa product, be sure to pick a brand that has the options you need to avoid mixing and matching. I really wanted Wemo to be this for me, but issues on multiple products are forcing me elsewhere."}

A few minutes and it configures itself with your home network.\n\nA big plus this has over other models is that it does not block the second outlet in a two gang box.\n\nThis does not track power usage, which would be a nice feature.

I'll say the few good parts about it were how easy it was to install, upgrade the firmware, and I like the design and the fact that I can use two on a single outlet. I think it's fair to give it 2 stars for that.\n\nThe whole reason I purchased these was so that I could use them with voice-activated smart device like Alexa. In order for that to work, I need them to stay connected to the WiFi network. Every few hours they would just randomly disconnect and they wouldn't reconnect until I unplugged them and plugged them back in. I went to their support forums and found that some people had some workarounds, like setting my WiFi channel statically and turning off my 5GHz network, but neither of them solved the problem. Oh and I rebooted all involved devices several times. Even if all that did solve the problem, I don't want to buy a product that tells me how I need to set up my network. If you claim to have WiFi enabled device, then you should make sure it easily works with WiFi.\n\nA note about my WiFi setup: it's super simple. I have a single wireless access point and the two WeMo minis are less than 20ft away on the same floor and in the same room, both plugged into the same outlet. I have not done anything fancy with my access point. I have a Nest Thermostat, Nest Protect, a Nest indoor camera, an Echo Dot as well as a couple phones and an iPad all connected to the WiFi. I don't feel like that should be enough devices to cause significant interference.\n\nThe other reason why I find this silly is because after connecting the Dot and the Nest products they just worked. I've never had a problem with network connectivity. So that means someone solved this problem years ago and I don't see why this should be one for the Minis.\n\nI fully admit I never called their support, but I'm pretty sure they're working as intended since I have two that are behaving identically and terribly.\n\nOverall I would not recommend this product unless you're very network savvy and like playing around with that stuff."}

I have been looking for a dimmer switch that can act BOTH as a dimmer or a regular on-off switch. This is IT! Installation is easy, and the dimmer works on both incandescent or led lights. Once I loaded into my WeMo app on the phone, I was in business. The only CON that I can think of is that there is no DEFAULT setting for the dimmer. So, if you turn on your lights and set the dimmer to say 50% and then turn off your lights. The next time you turn them on, they will be at 50%. There is a night mode in the app that can probably be set to overwrite this, but then you can't use the night mode for what it is intended for. It's not a big deal, but where I have my lights, my family will often adjust the lights for a dim mode without putting them back to 100%. Setting up to Alexas was easy too. \"Alexa, turn bar lights to 40%\" works great! I now have about 6 of these in my house and they are the BEST!"}

Two switches fix side by side, just barely because the back housing on the switch is pretty deep and wide. Our box was an older smaller version so cramping the wires in behind the two switches was a bit tricky. You can get a dual switch plate for a few bucks here on Amazon to fit 2 Wemo switches in. The switch works great as a stand alone by pressing the button and pairs really well with Alexa. The Wemo app is nice because it tells you if the light is on or off and we plan on using the remote feature to turn the outside light on when we are to arrive home after dark. Saves us a bit of money from keeping the light on all the time and also helps when on vacation to make people think someone is possibly home. The switches are also really well designed with their modern look. I was not paid for this review or given anything free, I am just a true fan of the product. Also, if you are familiar with Belkin, a brand that has been around for a long time going back to the days of MP3 players, then you may already know that the brand has a background for being very sound and solid. Belkin makes Wemo."}

The first unit will configure without any hassle - exactly as it is supposed to. Its the next ones - the second, third (and I now dread the fourth) - which require you to dust off that degree in network administration. Not sure if its the app or the firmware on the device but if there is a first switch already on your Wemo app in the same network, the second switch will just not install. I have tried everything - online forums, Wemo/Belkin suggestions, Router configurations, resets, stepped down to 2.4GHz network, reset the damn switch - everything ... after all this back and forth - the second switch worked. Now, trying the same for the third (yeah I felt adventurous) and its won't connect! This is NOT how consumer electronics should be. Not only do I want to return this piece of crap, I want to start a class action suit against the company for peddling a device that is clearly not built for prime time. Because I know I am not alone - just go online and see the other frustrated consumers who are trying to install multiple switches in the same network.\n\nYou cheated us Belkin with this Wemo device and I had so much hope from this product.\n\nI gave it two stars because trust me when I say this .. when this thing installs, it flies! It works exactly as desired and interconnects with all other systems - like IFTTT, Nest, Alexa ... no problems there.\n\nUpdate: So after I wrote the review - I did not give up - yeah, its in my DNA or whatever! Anyway, I may have solved it. So this is what needs to happen to install the second or any subsequent switches ... Step down your router to 2.4GHz, password needs to be just alphanumeric (no special characters), security needs to be WPA2 (no PSK etc), and - and - and - the piece I was missing - you need to switch your router's channel from Auto to a fixed channel number. I tried channel #1 and Bingo! BTW, once you set it up you can reverse all the changes - I went back to the SMart Switch of 5GHz+2.4GHz, full password protection, and Auto channel. Just thought if anyone else out there ran into the same issue ... Good Luck! But still 2 stars for making us do this. FYI - I am using Netgear's NightHawk R7000 router and configuring this on an iPhone 7 iOS 11.x."}

Our house was built in 2011, so it had all the wires, but had to add in a wire from existing (house) to connect the neutral (switches). I wanted to replace all three in our switch plate so I could program the outside garage lights, porch light, and entry light. The only issue we had was the electric box that holds the wires in the wall doesn\u2019t leave much room and the switches are BIG and take up a lot of space in the wall. We got the switches working, but once all the wires and switches were pushed back into place, two of them no longer worked correctly - some of the neutral wires were worked loose a bit. Had to cut some of the wires shorter to try and make a bit more space, tightened connections again, and put back together - then worked fine. WHEW. Four stars only because the switch \u201cguts\u201d are so big which makes for a harder install. Will update if issues with switches.\nProgramming through WeMo app was fine, although seems like you have to close and reopen app to refresh switches (when we were installing and kept cutting power off/on). Echo dot found the switches without me even telling it to search. Opened Alexa app and they were already listed under Smart Home.\n\n***UPDATE***\nWe noticed the switches are warm to the touch.

I had no issues with configuration for my Wemo. I have likewise had no problem with WiFi connection problems (I do have a very good, not cheapo, wireless router ). I have my Wemo linked into my Alexa device, and I use voice commands to control them. I also use the Alexa app to control lights, when I am away from home. I have had no issues, in any aspect.\n\nOne item I will mention is that if you use a Wemo to control a light switch in a room, there could be a partial inconvenience. If the light that you are controlling is tied into a wall on/off switch, you lose control of the light from that wall switch. The only way to turn the light on then is by manually pushing the button on the switch, or telling Alexa (if you have Alexa ) to turn the light on, or finally by using the Wemo app. If you are using Alexa, and Alexa is not in the room, Alexa is gone when you shut the door. You are then left with a manual turn on of the light, or using the Wemo application on your phone. In a kid's room, this is an issue. Even in an adult's room, having to manually turn the light on, or grab your phone to turn the light on will get tiring after a while. If the wall plug with the Wemo device is behind something, that just leaves the phone to turn the light on. If your phone has a dead battery, oh well.... You need to thing about where you want your lights controlled, and what happens when the door to the room is shut, with occupants inside, who need to turn the light on/off from inside of their room.

The Wemo is great when it works (much of the time), maddeningly difficult when it doesn't (too much of the time), and it's hard to reconnect to Alexa. It's expensive and should work all the time - much more inexpensive, imported outlets work consistently well (I've gone to them). BTW, Belkin creates a user-unfriendly challenge if you wish to have the company honor the one-year warranty: First step: \"No warranties will be honored unless the purchaser provides, at purchaser's expense, the product for inspection.\" OK, so that's on you - you buy the product, the product is bad, and then you pay again. Then, it's either telephone or snail mail - no online for Belkin. And so on.

We use Alexa in our home and have iPhones to run the apps, so we were ready to add this convenience. The initial setup looked to be fairly straightforward and similar to other smart home devices, so I wasn't anticipating any problems getting up and running. I plugged in the Smart Plug and waited for the lights to indicate it was ready to pair. I opened the WeMo app on my iPhone and started the pairing process. This is where I started running into issues. The app would connect to the Plug on it's private WiFi, and would ask for credentials to my home WiFi. When entering my home WiFi password, the app would crash and exit back to the iPhone home screen. Eventually, after 5-10 attempts, it finally made it past that screen and the Plug connected to my home network.\n\nOnce on my home network, the Plug immediately identified the need to upgrade its firmware before proceeding with any further setup. This is another area that caused trouble with the setup process. The Plug began upgrading firmware and was unresponsive for over half an hour. The light on the Plug was flashing white, indicating that the firmware update was still in progress. Not wanting to unplug it and potentially \"brick\" the Plug, I opted to call Belkin/WeMo tech support. I was on the phone with tech support for about a half hour while the rep walked me through a full factory reset process and a restart of the firmware update. Thankfully the Plug was not bricked and with tech support's help we were able to get it up and operational.\n\nTotal time for setup was just over a frustrating hour with half of that time spent on the phone with tech support. I've deducted a star from my rating because of this. It shouldn't be this hard. I'm an IT professional with >30 years in the business and if I have trouble with this, I can only imagine what the average non-IT-savvy homeowner would have gone through.\n\nSo, after the setup, I can only say that I'm extremely happy how the Plug performs. I've connected it to Alexa, and have yet to have a single operational issue. I can control it through my iPhone apps as well via voice through Alexa. I recommend this device, with my only reservation being the intermittent issues during setup. Hopefully they'll improve this experience with later updates to the app and firmware."}

In the last week I've had to say voice commands multiple times before the switches were found and activated. They're going back. Bought some TP link switches to replace them which were easy to set up out of the box without any issues.\n\nOriginal review:\nI had a significant number of issues getting them to work (wouldn't connect, couldn't find the switches after setting them up, etc, etc), now that I have the switches sorted out they've been good. In order to get them to work I did the following:\n\n- sett them up in an outlet very close to your WiFi router then move them to the outlet of your choice once they're set up\n- if you have a 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz Wifi network, temporarily remove the 5Ghz network from the phone you're using to set them up.\n- unplug any repeaters or secondary access points in your home network, only the primary WiFi router should be active during setup.\n- don't use the remember my network option when setting up the switches.\n\nI would buy them again on special (I paid $20 each), but would consider trying an alternative at current prices.\n\nAlso, I received what appeared to be a used unit from Amazon. There were scuff marks on the face of the switch and the protective film was missing, so be sure to check your merchandise."}

I used to have problems (and was afraid to) turn off schedules because they wouldn't turn back on (without having to delete and re-program them). That has been solved.

I have a Google Home Mini and a Chromecast, but my TV is so old that it's not only not \"smart,\" but it doesn't even CEC, so I can't use my Chromecast to turn it on and off. I plugged the TV into one of these smart plugs, and now I can turn it on and off with my voice through Home and from anywhere with the app. I used the other plug to make a lamp turn on at sunset at off at 11:30 pm. I turn all my lights off when I leave for work in the morning, so my pets end up hanging out in the dark for a while this time of year and I walk into a dark home when I get back from work. Not anymore! The plugs were easy to set up and the app is really easy to use. I linked it to my Nest, so I can use Nest's home/away functionality to control the plugs if I want. I have relatively new LED bulbs throughout my house, so I'm reluctant to replace them with smart bulbs. These plugs allow me to accomplish a lot of what I'd get from smart bulbs for my lamps, which is good enough for me. ALSO, the fact that this doesn't block the other plug in the outlet is pretty awesome."}

Because it's hooked to the web, it knows when the sun sets here, so no more fiddling around. And I also have it turn on the light just before I get up in the morning on weekdays, so I don't have to stumble around in the dark when I go downstairs.\n\nThe bad: I can't tell you how I set it up the first time, but the setup directions bore no relationship to reality. Then we bought a new router, and once again, the directions for how to set up a new router didn't work, so I fumbled through a setup all over again.

It's a very nice switch and works great with my LED bulbs although I did replace some bulbs that made a slight buzzing sound when dimmed with an older model of the same bulb that didn't have a buzzing issue.\n\nI didn't run into any major problems in setup, but was confused at the instructions that said the light was suppose to be flashing blue or something for setup mode. It wasn't flashing anything but the switch was still in setup mode because the WiFi networks were there.\n\nThe Wemo app lets you choose the type of bulb these will be running and set a dimming range so that the lights won't flicker. Pretty slick.\n\nI set up a routine in Alexa to turn on the kitchen lights at a dimmed level when I say \"Alexa, night mode\". I like the subdued (dimmed) lighting at night.\n\nI wish there was a nightlight mode so that you could turn on the bottom part of the switch that lights up and keep it on, perhaps at a dimmed level.\n\nThis dimming switch it quite expensive but so far I'd say it's worth the extra cost.\n\nI'll update this review if anything changes.\n\nUPDATE 2018-01-04: Downrating to 4 stars because the switches stopped responding and disappeared from the WeMo app. I wasted time troubleshooting and having to reboot the switches. Turning off the light then holding down the LED bar for 2-5 seconds seemed to do the trick after I spent time researching and trying other things.\n\nUPDATE 2018-07-08: My wife does not want the lights to dim so you'd think something as simple as just turning off the dimming feature would be easy, right? Well, nope... first, I couldn't disable the dimming feature or change the bulb type (to change the dim range) with the WeMo iOS app but on Android there is the option to change the bulb type. After I figured that out then I spend maybe 15 to 20 minutes trying to just turn off the dimming feature. Because there is not simple option to do this, I had to mess with the dimming settings to try to adjust the dim range. It ended up being a big waste of time with the lousy interface but I eventually managed to set the dim range to maybe 80%-100%.

I have these plugs integrated into my SmartThings hub and Echo Plus. They have work reliably when i operate them from wither system, as well as the Belkin WeMo app. The setup is pretty easy and they did their best to write large simple instructions on how to connect this. You do need a rudamentary understanding of wifi and the internet, but if you can connect your smart phone to different wifi and download apps you should be able to figure this out.\n\nOnce connected, when the unit is powered on, theres a small white LED that lets you know its powered. I like this feature because a quick glance toward the one that controls my doggy cam lets me know its powered. Theres also an audible click when the unit cycles on/off. Some people complain about this, but i like the click becuase after i tell Alexa to turn it on, that click confirms the command was processed.\n\nThese plugs are a little long, but the desgn is sleek and modern enough they dont look bad. I have a Samsung smart plug, and the thing is Fugly. These plugs let you put them in the top or bottom plug without obstructing the unused plug. This is important to me since i have many things that use large plugs that need to occupy the bottom plug. With these WeMos i can work around those large clunky power adapters. The botton on them allows you to turn them on and off easily. Sometimes its easier to just push the botton instead of having to open an app if you dont have voice controls.\n\nThese are great plugs that have not given me any issues. Would buy more of them if needed."}

I arrogantly thought that the troubles folk were having was due to a lack of their experience - Ha! Eventually I hit upon the arcane sequence of rebooting and running the setup required and it connected. The jubilation was tangible, but then ....NO....It demanded a firmware upgrade. It upgraded and the app could never see it again. Thinking I must have a defective product I tried number two, this time using a lamp plugged in right next to the router so I could juggle the rebooting and resetting. I connected and was running within 20 minutes. I thought I'd better check numbers 3&4, and alas during this three hour long episode I had to uninstall and reinstall the app. Well that was the last I ever saw of switch number two, it just would not reappear in the app again no matter what I tried. Switches 3&4 never did connect to my local network despite me trying all combinations of router/phone/switch reboot/reset. I finally concluded that these are just not ready for market, boxed them up and sent them back to Amazon for a refund.

Sometimes they seem to work great and other times, they don't, I can't figure out a pattern. It's not my wifi network, I have 4 commercial grade APs around my house in a full mesh so there's nowhere that I don't have a strong signal. We don't lose pwer either, so I don't know why they seem to fall off the network. There have been multiple firmware updates for them but it doesn't seem to have fixed the stability problems. I would probably return these if I could but I've had them too long. I have one behind my lizard cage to run the day time light, so to recover the switch and get it back on the network I have to move the cage, which isn't small! It's a pain in the butt to deal with, however the switch does seem to follow it's programming and turn on/off at the right times even when it shows as unavailable in the app, so it does seem to be doing the right things.\n\nOne other thing to note. If you use iOS with an iPad, the only app in the App Store is the phone version. There is no tablet version of the app. You can run the phone version but it will be on a phone sized screen (or 2x if you hit the enlarge button), but it won't rotate with the orientation of the tablet. It's fine if you have an iPhone (don't know about the X or other new high-res screens though). I use an Android phone (Note 8 running 7.1.1) and it mostly works, except when it shows the devices are not detected. This can happen with the Wemo light switch too, so I don't know if this is an App problem or a device (ioT) problem. Whatever it is, it sucks and is very frustrating. Tech support isn't any help either, so don't bank on them solving your problem unless you have a basic problem."}

{"Author": "Kevin M. McConnell", "Date": "on November 27, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great switch, with some really important things to note on setup", "Text": "I recently purchased a few of these for my home. I installed one of the switches to test it out before going all in. My home was upgraded in terms of electrical wiring before I moved in, so getting this installed was a breeze. I think only older homes with older electrical will experience issues without having a neutral wire, which is required for this to operate properly.\n\nNow where I encountered an issue was with the wifi/Alexa setup. To be clear, this is mainly an issue with the Belkin software as opposed to the device.\n\nFirst issue, getting the switch to connect to the wifi. It only supports 2.4ghz, which is typical of IoT devices. After some research, this was a firmware bug that was causing the issue. Luckily, I have a Wemo Insight Plug, which helped me get past this issue by allowing a firmware upgrade. Where the Belkin app fails is not letting the user perform a firmware upgrade BEFORE setup. It is an oversight and may cause issues for new users.\n\nSecond issue, if you set the Alexa skill up before the device is done, it will not work. I had the skill enabled for my plug, which was an older version of the skill. To remedy this, I deleted the skill and re-enabled it. Once I did, I re-scanned for devices and there it was. Again, this is another oversight on the Belkin side.\n\nThird issue, in the instructions, when you have to factory reset the device, the steps provided are not accurate. First you must reboot the switch, after pressing that, hold the reset button for 5 seconds until you get a blinking amber wifi light. After that, you can re-enter setup. Please note, this is only required if you need to do a factory reset. The reboot function by itself works fine.\n\nIn terms of switch functions, this isn't anything new. Having the voice and app controls are fantastic. Presently, I do not have any rules setup, so I cannot speak to that. My biggest complaint about these switches are the inadequate documentation and the very clunky app. Both need major revisions to solve some of the issues I outlined in this review. I do suspect that most people will not encounter any issues, but for those with a similar setup as mine, follow the steps above and you should be up and running in no time."}

Following the directions, it took me about 5 minutes to install and set up with the Wemo app on my iPhone. My wife didn't like the schedule rule I created, so she downloaded the app and \"fixed\" it to her liking. She is a tech-savvy homemaker...not an IT engineer. One of my issues with the product is that we can't use Siri for voice activation of the smartplug. Our next purchase will be one of the Amazon Echo devices to use Alexa for voice activation. A couple of other issues: 1.) there should be a way to secure the WiFi connection of the Wemo unit 2.) with these home automation products is, how far do we go just to keep from standing up out of the recliner to turn on a light.... :-)"}

Nothing could get this thing to go through its own setup process successfully.\n\nI have Echo Dots and Philips Hue Lights in my Home and those go through a similar setup process (the device broadcasts a WiFi network and then once you connect to it, uses that to transfer to your actual WiFi).

Protects the device, and makes it aesthetically pleasing while unboxing\n\nSetup -- Long story short, it's a pain. My TPLink smart plug was a breeze to set up in comparison. However, here are some tips that worked for me (iOS):\n1. Download the Wemo app\n2. Plug in the mini smart plug\n***3. Turn on airplane mode on your iPhone*** --> this solved all my issues of the app losing signal to the plug!\n4. Turn on wifi, and connect to your plug once it blinks green/amber color\n5. Open the Wemo app and go through the setup process\nIf you previously tried to setup the plug and failed, forget the plug on your wifi list, and uninstall/reinstall the Wemo app, then go back to step 2\nHope that helps anyone who got frustrated like me\n\nAlexa -- connects easily to it and works as intended. It seems to work better with Alexa than TPLink's smart plug in terms of performing the task it should be doing. I'll be switching to Google Home Mini, so hopefully it'll work fine with that as well.\n\nWemo App -- Setup was terrible and the app (version 1.18.1) crashed a few times trying to get it working, however once it does work, the app works as intended. It is also slower than TPLink's app, which is not saying much to be honest since their app is slow as well. I have it currently setup to turn on/off my christmas lights on a schedule and it has been working so far.\n\nOverall, not bad for the $20 I spent. I'll keep updating this review if problems arise.

I went to leave my review on the product link (from order history) where I purchased the item, however it kept linking me to this dimmer switch?!?\n\nI gave this product 2 stars because 1) the price is reasonable compared to similar products by other manufacturers and 2) the ease of setup using the WeMo App. The problem that was discovered was within the 'Rules' section of the App, where you can set schedules to make the light turn ON/OFF as you wish, either based on time, sunrise/sunset, or any combination of them. This feature simply does not work at all, so now I find myself having to access the App to manually turn ON the light (exterior light) at sunset and turn OFF the light when we go to sleep. This is a widely discussed issue that many are having and if I had seen these comments prior, I would have bough elsewhere. I've tried all the tips by many of the Belkin community posts such as deleting and recreating the rules, resetting my home wifi network, deleting and reinstalling the WeMo App, restarting the light switch, and finally resetting the light switch - none of these worked!!\n\nBelkin - please look into this as this app is the backbone of what you are trying to achieve.\n\nIf anyone else has any other solutions to this problem, please comment.\n\nWemo Light Switch, Wi-Fi enabled, Amazon Alexa and Google Home Accessories (Certified Refurbished)"}

The switch works okay. You're somewhat limited in that you have to use it in a single switch box (I have fewer of those in my house than I realized. Most have multiple switches.) It doesn't work with 3-way switches (i.e. when one light or outlet is controlled by more than one switch) and it does require a neutral wire, which some older houses don't have.\n\nBut once it's installed, it works fine. We use it mainly with Alexa (because of the no Homekit thing) because launching an app to turn a switch on or off is dumb when you can walk across the room in less time.

I use my earlier version smart plug every day, and it has always worked well.\n\nOff to UPS to drop this in the return heap."}

They installed easily having enough prior electrical knowledge to change out switches and outlets. You do need a neutral(white) wire as stated. The switch does come with connected wires so you won't need to add a jumper.\n\nI did have some issues connecting the first one to my wifi. It could just be yet another bug in IOS11 and I saw a few people out there having the same problem. I had to delete the app, restart my phone, then reinstall the app. Once I did that everything setup smoothly. Also once the first dimmer connected, the rest of them setup without a problem. It is really nice that you can set the dim range along with the type of lightbulbs.\n\nThe app is really easy to use and you can set up rules/connect to Nest or IFTT or Alexa to make it even more convenient. The only thing I wish is that you could access from the web. Maybe a software update in the future?\n\nThe dimmer itself works well and is quite responsive. Capacitive touch dimming is good but isn't perfect. No real complaints even so. Overall its a nice dimmer to compliment the other quality Wemo products."}

I then tried to set it up for a lamp in their home, and could not get it to work with their router after about an hour of trying.\nI gave up and brought it home, determined to fool with it until it worked. After resetting it several times, and making multiple attempts to get it on the wifi, I'm pleased to say it's working. I've connected my Christmas tree to it (decorated a bit early this year), and have linked it to my Echo. It's as simple as saying, \"Alexa, turn on the tree.\" It's also strangely fun and rewarding.\nI'm pretty tech-savvy, but still had some difficulty when this turned out not to be quite as easy as the few steps it has listed on the pamphlet.\nAnyway, I may purchase more if I can find adequate uses for them.

She then instructed me to change the App Store Filter to only display iPhone apps. I changed it and, viola, the app I wanted appeared. I quickly thanked her and tried to hang up the phone. But, the young lady wouldn\u2019t let me. She said that was just the first step and said she\u2019d be glad to help me with the remaining steps. She waited while I installed the app on my iPad. She then asked about my iPhone and waited while that was installed. My wife came in at that point and the lady asked if she\u2019d like to I have the app on her iPhone and waited while it loaded.

You'll have to push the button, or turn it back on in the app. (When you suddenly realize \"Oh no, the cat box is still off!\") Again, having a schedule programmed will probably remedy this issue.\n\nI'm thinking of ordering another one, to have my modem/router on a schedule.

Design. AMAZING - these all look great. Wish the light at the bottom would stay on at times because it makes it look so high tech. (This is the only reason it is getting 2 stars)\n\n2. App (Android) - starts out great. The linking process is simple and the app checks the lowest light setting possible to properly setup the range. BUT, after the setup, it is the worst thing ever which will make you want to return them. Loading the app is ridiculously slow. The lights randomly show up as disconnected and it takes a few seconds for them to become connected. When you try to make schedules for the lights, you have to wait 10+ seconds to start the process and each saving step takes another 10secs. I wanted to make a light dim to a lower setting; go from 100% (7pm) to 10% (8:30pm) and then turn off (7am). You cannot do this with these lights, unless you use 3rd party software. You have to set it up to turn on then off at a certain time. Then turn on again a minute later (in dim setting) and turn off again. THIS IS WHERE THE LEVITON IS AMAZING - SUPER FAST APP AND VERY EASY CUSTOMIZING!!! IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO USE THE LEVITON APP AFTER THE WEMO.\n\nIn the end, if you want a nice looking switch then fine spend the money. But, if no one is going to really be seeing the switch or you just want a quality product that works remarkably well, get the LEVITON."}

She tried to have me do the basic things to get my wemo to install, but it didn't work. She escalated it to a level 2 tech who she said would call me back at a later time. I specifically asked to be called after 7 PM pacific. The level 2 tech first calls me at 5:30 PM the next day, then 10 AM the day after that. Obviously I am not home at those times, so my call back time was basically ignored. Then I tried to chat with a representative to get in touch with a level 2 tech. It seemed it didn't know my case at all and when I asked for a level 2 tech to call me before the office closed, he was saying they would, but no one called. I called back the wemo support line to request a direct number to a level 2 tech, but was denied. Then later a member of the escalation team left a message on my answering machine with a direct number to call. In summary, I felt like there were numerous mis-steps in taking care of my situation. Also I felt lied to when the rep told me there is no way to contact a level 2 tech and then later on I was provided the number.\n\nMy problem with the install was that the wemo will not connect to my wifi because my wifi ID had a special character. In my case, it was a space. I had to change it to an underscore and it connected. Also, it seems when my nest thermostat was connected during the install, the wemo install would fail. I had to change the frequency band to either 5 ghz from 2.4 ghz or disconnect it for the install. Belkin really needs to improve and smooth out these quirks for an easier install process.\n\nAlthough my wemo device works now, I cannot recommend this product to anyone I know do to the horrible install process and horrible customer service process."}

Perry", "Date": "on November 14, 2017", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Decent product but hampered by the software application", "Text": "Overall the product is decent and delivers functionality based on the design. In general I consider myself rather savvy with regards to general computer knowledge and network configuration. I have my own custom network configuration at home with distinct wireless networks on various bands including separated guest network, etc. My current job is in the IT industry providing end user support. I only mention all of that for background purposes and whatever it is worth for credibility sake. Overall I would say the physical plug is good quality and fairly straightforward in terms of basic functions. Where the issues lie are really within the internal firmware and the associated software application.\n\nThe initial setup is where I experienced issues, as other reviewers have noted. Establishing a connection from the plug to the wireless network seemed to be the most problematic. It would occasionally fail to recognize any network in my home, I tried multiple both hidden and visible. Typically the software would indicate incorrect credentials and refused to establish a connection. I even returned the plug in exchange for another unit. That behaved in the same manner. I eventually was able to establish a connection through the software application but only after trying for an extended period. Unfortunately I cannot definitively say what steps were successful since I tried so many different paths. One thing I would mention is you may have to try repeatedly in the app, despite how frustrating.\n\nI would also allow the app time to connect, it seems even if it indicates failure to connect, there were times it actually established a connection from the plug to the wireless network but gave a false feedback. Indicating it had failed to connect. In my opinion the software app needs some improvement and is not as robust as is needed for this type of product. The plug itself has worked fine ever since the setup was successfully completed. I have been able to use the app to control the plug, as well as integrate with Amazon Alexa for voice control."}

Called Tech support, not only were they not useful, they were rude. I did reset on switches, app would crash. Always at same point after it initially connected to phone and all testing completed successfully but when it was to connect to the local wifi (I have a fast strong signal - I am an IT architect so house is setup pretty well.) They told me they would pass it to level 2 support to contact me back in 24-48hrs or whenever my turn in Queue was (could be longer? wow) So then when done, the lady insisted i read her back the number for the ticket they way she gave it to me. (who is serving who here?)\n\nGot off phone and was ticked off and was about to remove them so to prove they are terrible customer support i took the challenge to figure it out myself. I did and it is not documented. What i found is that by holding down the LED bar it will turn white (reset). that is in the documentation and didnt work. I then held it longer and it has another after white, it goes back to blue. Nope didnt work. Hold it even longer it goes red. Wait, i got past where i hung up before, ah still didnt work. Even longer it goes dark. Now it connects to my wifi every time i hold it to that point.\n\nEach time i tried i deleted the app, rebooted the phone, redownloaded the wemo app. Since there is no documentation on stages of reset I only knew they were different so i decided to do them in pairs to see if that cycled it.\n\nRed try/fail, then to only white/try fail worked. It finally connected to my network but alas it wouldnt allow the device to be recognized so i reset after the red reset try/fail, white reset/try fail to the complete dark tried and Bingo, connection and worked as expected.\n\nI bought two so Second one should work right? NOPE.\n\nI had to go through the exact same reset chain try/fail at red, try fail after white and try after dark, each time removing app from phone and rebooting it to clear artifacts. After that It connected and worked too.\n\nIn total 6hrs spent on figuring this thing out.\n\nOnce installed it did work as anticipated and connected both to Alexa. Glad I did because their app LOSES devices! They do eventually come back but they are not accessible through the app, but if connected to Echo they can still be controlled via echo!\n\nSo after more research it appears that they take your email (required as it is how they connect you in their database) and log with that at their facility your wifi password information. The wifi switches then connect to THEIR servers!\n\nThis is not a local solution!\n\nSo the app also connects to their servers and when a device doesnt poll back it drops off the list. That is why alexa can control it despite it not showing in app at the exact time it is still controllable by alexa.\n\nNow the product seems solidly built and has potential to be good in later versions (when they get the kinks out of network connection - and according to online posts alot of people fail here and simple remove. I doubt many if any of those fought through as i did)\n\nI havent had it drop were alexa could not control it. I have had it drop (many times) where the app is unable to see one or the other switches.\n\nThe app is nice and clean and is good (when devices show).\n\nThe most fun part was typing in teh network password over and over for different networks only to have it say it was incorrect when they were correct and eventually worked.\n\nThis has great potential to be a 5/5 but it did not work out of the box for either and customer support would be more useful if it simply said, leave a number and we will call you back during the following week. (pretty much the same result - and for the record ... I am still waiting on the call back from customer service tech level 2 LOL. Will see how many days it takes to get to me in the Queue. (and if the Queue is that long then... well you draw your own conclusion)\n\nI didnt give 1 star because when i got it working it works (well with alexa if i didnt have that and wanted to use the App this would be at 1 star because the device drops are a pain for the app!) so i gave it 2 stars.\n\nPros:\nSolid built\nDoes what you want (if you have echo/alexa)\n\nCons:\ndoes not work out of box\nPAIN to connect to wifi\nDrops devices / unable to be reliably controlled from app\ncustomer service is 0/5 stars (and that is generous)\nYour home network password is stored and accessible by their employees (so make sure you setup a separate private network for your smart home devices!!!)\n\nBottom line: stick with it long enough and you will get it to work but expect alot of resetting, deleting app, rebooting phone, etc in that process and will take you hour minimumn AFTER you install in the wall.\n\nOH, BTW, there is a mac address on back of unit. Make sure to take a picture of that for each device!!!\n\nI could have shortcut about 2hrs total if i had that information. Its not on or in box, only on device. Once connected you have it in the app, but you cannot get to that until it is all installed! There was a point I could have entered the mac adderss with email and it would have setup in their servers via the echo skills!\n\nHad I only known to get that number, but once installed and breaker back on and was setting up, I really didnt feel like back to breaker box, turning off electricity, removing BOTH from wall far enough to see back through wiring to take photos then reinstall and turning electricity back on.\n\nHowever If i had known how bad the customer service would have been or how long it would have taken to get it to accept my wifi settings (instead of that constant \"almost there' feeling before app crashes a litter farther each time) it would have been faster if that worked.\n\nSo get that MAC information before you begin installation and lights on for clear photo! Then if you have echo/alexa you may be able to get it once it connect to your wifi but is unrecognizable by their app (due to crashes) Since alexa sees device on network, and that device connects to their server, that will likely work.\n\nPS: From all i have read these devices store your wifi settings so if you change network password, want to put it on a different \"smart home network\" or change routers, you WIILL have to go through it again!"}

Wemo doesn't like having some devices at home and some away, on 2 different wifi networks. I had to set up a separate Amazon account on one phone to keep them separate without constantly switching Amazon accounts. Every time I tried to set up a Wemo mini in my hotel room, it took hours of effort, usually on my hands and knees, to get Wemo on the wifi of the hotel and to be visible to the Wemo app on my iPhone. This most recent time I'd see about 8 phony copies of my hotel wifi network name but none seemed to work. Finally, I downloaded a 3rd party software, WSwitch which saw the 'mini' which had been set up but not usable by the Wemo software. Then the Wemo app saw the device too. Then Alexa worked with it. Crappy Wemo software is all I can say. By the way, many resets of my Wemo mini to factory settings."}

My first issue is that this device is not HomeKit compatible, this is by no means a dealbreaker, but it does prevent some functionality that HomeKit users get from their other devices. The second issue, that could be fixed with an update, is the inability to set either an ON or Off timer. The only timer option with specific times is an On/Off setup only; otherwise, you can set a countdown timer. I wanted to ensure the heater would shut off if I forgot to turn it off. With the current timers available I was able to set a very short On/Off timer (ex. On at 7:59AM Off at 8:01AM) to ensure the heater will always be off by 8:02AM. However, based on the ease of setup, the convenient instal ion options, the price, and the reliability I will be buying more of these devices."}

Apparently, the scheduler uses the time on the wifi router rather than the location you specify on the wemo setting.

(Every time the app opens in fact, it takes 7-10 seconds on my phone to load.) Arguably a downgrade. I was under the impression that sending the signal over the network, not opening the app would have been the bottleneck. Overall, considering how much time in this day and age we spend waiting for our phones to load things, I think that this solution needs to be more well thought out.\n\nI have tried this UI both on an LG g4 and Google Pixel 2 - it has the same glitches, so it is not a phone hardware issue.\n\nAdditionally: WeMo should add support for Google Assistant (and Siri and Alexa?) to control this device not from devices, but from phones. This would also get rid of the lost 10 seconds I spend waiting for my phone's UI.\n\nEdit: I have updated this review after 2 months and deducted 2 stars.\n\nFirst off, on Android you can set widgets on your home screen, but they are laughably terrible in terms of whether they work. They theoretically show you at a glance whether the light is on or off, but it is stupidly inaccurate and shows a false state. I have a higher rate of success just opening the app. So that was a headache.\n\nBut even in the app, devices just straight up don't work. They don't load and clicking on them leads not to any type of troubleshooting help, but an insulting option to \"hide the disabled device until it shows up again\". Why the hell would I want to do that when I need it to be working? So I can, you know, toggle it? What a dissappointment.\n\nIt's a dream come true about 20% of the time. Down from my expectations of 100%.

When I bought these I was just starting to experiment with home automation. They worked so well I started researching every other possible thing I could buy, and interestingly ultimately decided that for now these were enough and just what I needed. In the future I may invest more into lighting switches.\n\nI would say if you can get over the fact that these will add an inch or so of depth to your wall socket, and have been considering them, please go ahead and buy them. You absolutely will not regret it!\n\nBonus: I had originally bought some TP-Link smart plugs as well. I did really like those (they worked great, and their minis were SUPER sleek), but at the time they did not have IFTTT support meaning I couldn't use them with Google Home. I believe they do work with Amazon products, so I'd check those out as another option if you use Amazon products."}

That's really nice! They seem a little wider than they'd need to be. It would be nice it they were, at maximum, the width of the wall plate. It should serve the purposes of most users/use-cases. I wish I could control my WEMO devices via a web browser -- and not just an app on my phone. I think it would be easier to program schedules via a web browser. The app is functional but, even as a tech guy, I'm not able to program things super fast through the app. I also wish WEMO had some (OOTB) integration with Synology's NAS and Surveillance Station. (I have seen some backwards ways to integrating the two.)\n\nSetup of the WEMO SWITCH devices is a breeze! Simply plug your WEMO DEVICE into a power outlet and plug your device into the WEMO. Then, hop onto your Smartphone, download the WEMO app, connect your phone to WEMO\u2019s temporary Wi-Fi, follow the prompts, and BAM, your WEMO is setup. You should give the WEMO a descriptive name to identify it from any other WEMO devices you may have \u2013 or purchase later when you see how helpful they are!\n\nI have 4 WEMO devices (2 Mini Smart Plugs and 2 Insight Switches - the latter I've had for over a year). I originally bought the Insight Switches for Christmas lights. I chose the Insight Switches, in particular, because I wanted to see how much electricity my Christmas Light displays were pulling and costing me throughout the season. This was successful.\n\nA more recent use for the WeMo devices is to control several heating devices for our HEDGEHOG's cage. We have 2 WEMO INSIGHT SWITCHES \u2013 1 for the heating pad and 1 for the heat lamp \u2013 that allow us to turn the heating pad and heat lamp on and off from anywhere in the world! We\u2019re able to determine when to turn on or off the heat because we have a camera setup in Harvey\u2019s cage that also captures the current temperature of the cage. We specifically use the INSIGHT SWITCHES because I'm very concerned for our hedgehog's well being and, while I'm sure WEMO Smart Plug's are working when the \"green light\" is on in the App, I'd rather see ENERGY USAGE in real time via the INSIGHT SWITCH to KNOW that the heating pad and heat lamp are actually FUNCTIONAL and heating Harvey."}

Note that Alexa cannot discover dimmers directly on the LAN (unlike other on/off WeMo switches) so you must add the WeMo skill to Alexa to allow your dimmers to be discovered.\n\nSwitches look very high tech with their built-in light feedback. One tiny light (dimmer level) stays on when the switch is off, which makes switches easy to find in the dark, a nice touch. Touch-sensitive dimming works well.\n\nMultiple dimmers can be controlled at the same time by creating Alexa groups. It's awesome to be able to say \"Alexa, set kitchen lights to 50\" and control all the kitchen dimmers with one phrase.\n\nMy only complaint is that I wish these switches cost less so I could buy more of them!"}

These require you to install (yet another) app on your phone to setup. I did not want yet another app to install on my phone, or another hub, or another skill... and its my fault I didn't read too closely that it's not Z-Wave or Zigbee.\n\nWhy use Z-Wave or Zigbee? Because they work with so many smart home hubs as well as Alexa and Google. WiFi devices require you to install yet another resource-hungry app on your phone or another skill to Alexa or Google. WiFi devices like WeMo also only carry as far as your WiFi signal carries - thats it. Zigbee and Z-Wave devices talk to each other - sort of a \"mesh\" that pass along commands from one to another. In my house I have Zigbee devices that far outreach any of my four WiFi networks.\n\nSo how does this unit compare? Eh... slow start up compared to my Zigbee outlet. It took this WeMo about a minute after plugging it in to an outlet before it would start working. Compare that to about 15 seconds on my Zigbee outlet. Also, I can place my Zigbee outlet in the fringe areas of my WiFi networks and know it will work because it talks to the other Zigbee devices that are nearer to it. This WeMo does not play well on the 5ghz networks, and thus has a hard time getting commands from floors away.\n\nIt seems to work great line-of-sight and on the same floor as my WiFi router.\n\nI like that it doesn't consume more than one outlet space in real estate on the outlet. The button is right there on the front, no searching the sides to turn the device on.\n\nIn all, I'm sure these WiFi devices are fine for those who do not have a complex smart home setup, rather they just want something simple, maybe a few devices and not much more. If you own a Wink Hub and need something Z-wave or Zigbee, don't stop here, keep moving along. Again, my own fault for not reading the description closely enough, however I think I have justified above why it deserves the \"It's okay\" rating."}

All 4 were put to use on our second floor. Our router is also on the second floor (this is important, as \"smart\" devices all need to connect to WiFi to communicate). Specifically, my router is in our Master Bedroom, as are 3 of the 4 WeMo smart plugs. I also have an Echo Dot in my room, next to my Router. The fourth and final WeMo was installed in a room just down the hall from me (also on the second floor) along with another Echo Dot. My intended use case was to use them to power lamps (very standard use case). It is definitely worth mentioning that I have an absolutely beastly router. My router can blast a 100Mbps connection throughout both floors of my house and even maintain a connection out on the street - that's how strong my router is.\n\nNow that the setup is clear, I'd really love to inform all of you that only one of these 4 WeMos can reliably connect to my router (again, 3 of my WeMos reside in the same room as my router). Two of the WeMos are directly across my Bedroom from the Router. One has a clear shot, the other is behind a small Nightstand. The WeMo with the clear shot always behaves. The WeMo behind the nightstand seemed okay for up to 1 hour after initial setup, but then was no longer able to maintain connection to my WiFi. My third WeMo has direct line-of-sight partially blocked by two computer towers. This WeMo sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. My fourth and final WeMo down the hall from my room worked for about an hour after initial setup (just like the one blocked by the nightstand), and then ceased to connect to my WiFi.\n\nThe bottom line is this: you can't sell a \"smart home\" product if it can only communicate while being in direct line-of-sight of your router. The fact that my sample size was 4, together with the consistent behavior I witnessed, leads me to conclude that this hardware is just awful. As my title states, I have not a single clue how this device has so many positive reviews. The Fakespot profile of this page indicates that there may be some deception involved with these reviews. I hope more people see mine. Do NOT waste your money on this product. Especially not for this outrageous price!!!"}

The free app makes it easier than ever to set up appliances in your home and control them with the click of a button. WeMo devices also pair with Amazon Alexa, Nest and other smart home devices. One downfall is that I have a lot of old 2 prong plugs in my house and the WeMo Smart Plug is a 3 prong and needs to have a connector on it. This makes it stick out a bit from the wall, but not the end of the world. I plan on upgrading the plug to 3 prong soon. I also really like the away feature you can set to turn the lamp on and off at random times during travel to make it appear someone is in the home.\n\nI purchased one to test out controlling a lamp on the first floor of my home, and I am liking the results so far.

I have taken advantage of the timers, long press and combining devices together. Sort of like having a dynamic electrician allowing you to change how switches interface with the homeowner.\n\nThere have been some quirks with devices failing to respond (later they fix themselves) or when I upgraded my router, these things went into manual mode for a few hours. I tried emailing support but heard nothing. Later, each device was back online. The WiFi name never changed, only the IP changed, go fugue.

Turning it on works well. However, automatic shut off of the radio off after 1 minute only works about 3 out of 5 times. When it doesn't work, the radio keeps going and going until I manually shut it off by giving the Echo DOT the command.

I had already started populating my house with TP-link smart switches due other reviews I have seen stating that the TP-link switches tended to be less glitchy and more robust in operation. After a few days using the new Wemo dimmer, I am very pleased. It is pleasing to the eye and set up was a breeze. There was a brief learning curve when it came to utilizing the touch sensitive dimmer slider thing but it works well once you figure out how to touch it. I am also happy with the seamless functionality with my Google assistant.\n\nWhat really sets this apart are the Wemo features. Being able to program a long press function that will command other Wemo devices in the house is a feature I was left searching for with my TP-link hardware. The only area where it falls behind the TP-link switches is in response time using Google assistant. When I say \"Turn on all of the lights\" the TP-link switches will fire first every time. Along with this, the Wemo app takes a bit longer to boot up than I'd like but the added functionality over the other switches makes up for this.\n\nPending any horrible recurring errors with this switch I will definitely be purchasing more Wemo products."}

My wife, who doesn't bother with such things, has been pleased to have lights on for her early morning gym regime.\n\nI also have a Google Home, which automatically recognized the devices and added them to its home control, which allowed voice control of the smart plugs painlessly easy.\n\nHighly recommend!"}

Simple solution.", "Text": "This does what it is supposed to do but set-up can be frustrating. I installed this to be able to remotely control a living room light. It found my network and then prompted me to update the firmware. So far, so good. After the firmware update it again found the network and I was able to configure the Wemo via the app (iPhone version). BUT one of the main reasons I bought it was to use 'Alexa' to turn the light on and off via voice. This is why the reduction of one star. The directions from the box were clear. Enable remote access in the Wemo app, add the Wemo \"Smart Home\" skill in Alexa... which requires linking the accounts. That where the problem occurs. The app presents a timer and asks you to manually push the switch on the Wemo, it is then supposed to go to the Wemo cloud and link the account. It did not work, the progress bar would go about 1/8th of the way and then just start over... and over and over. After a couple of days I finally gave Wemo support a call... could not believe what the support person said to do! Just say \"Alexa, discover my devices\". And it worked! So, the final review: The Wemo mini smart plug: 5 stars, it works. The Wemo directions for set up of Alexa: 2 stars, very frustrating. The Wemo support: 5 stars, very willing to help and simple solution. Overall: 4 stars because of the first two frustrating days."}

I have no complaints and recommend it for smart home use or even something as simple as a timer or standalone appliance or light controller.\n\nOverview:\n\nThe Wemo mini is easy to set up, use and integrates well with other smart home devices such as Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control and Nest for device sync. Unlike some other smart home devices, the mini does not require a hub. Using the mobile app you can easily control from anywhere, expand or modify your Wemo devices to control your lights and appliances.\n\nI really like the form factor. Unlike many similar devices, the mini allows two devices to be plugged into the same outlet.\n\nI really got tired of dealing with individual plugin timers that sometimes work or sometimes didn't or that had very limited capabilities. You can schedule the mini in whatever way you need, you can sync them, stagger them or make them work randomly. Much better than a better than a than a standalone timer. It even works with Nest. You can sync Nest with the mini for automatic home/away control. Try doing that with a standalone wall plug timer.\n\nWiFi Connectivity:\n\nThis is a non issue based on my personal experiences. I did have a small problem on one occasion to connect with Wi-Fi, but this was due to the placement of the Wemo Mini behind a steel table leg which interfered with the wireless signal. After moving the table momentarily while initially connecting to the Wi-Fi router, things worked fine afterward.\n\nIFTTT Integration:\n\nYou can even expand your uses by using readily available IFTTT apps or by writing your own which is easy and doesn't require any programming knowledge.\n\nStar Rating:\n\nThe only reason, I didn't rate the Mini Smart plug a five is it's cost. However, you can sometimes find these discounted so if you plan to get several, I suggest that you look for one of these purchasing opportunities. I purchased each of mine by waiting for one of these discount events.\n\nOwner Observations:\n\nWhile you can control lights with the Mini Smart plug, I would recommend you determine what you want to use it for before before purchasing as there may be better alternatives especially if you're considering to use for primarily controlling lights. You may want to consider purchasing something like a Hue light kit depending on how many lights you plan. If you plan to limit your light control to a single light or multiple lamps connected to a strip, then go with the Mini. I highly recommend using the Mini for non-lighting functions and to control other devices."}

Besides waiting 10 minutes to connect, I spent a half hour on chat with a support representative redoing all the tests I had already done. Ultimately they replaced the switch, but it was a real hassle and waste of everyone's time. From reading on forums, it is a common problem for firmware updates to brick these devices. Poor design to not be able to avoid this, have a safe mode boot or rollback to previous firmware easily. Then their replacement policy has a tight window to return the unit once you receive replacement, likely causing some consumers to have a full charge for replacement value on their card. Clearly a company that is thinking about the wrong things and not about the customer. It is unlikely I will buy more Wemo devices due to this."}

I will warn you to check your switch that you're planning on installing this into - 1. Does it have a neutral wire? Some older homes don't. 2. Is it a single switch? (i.e. There's only one switch that will turn on the light not two like one at the top of the stairs and one at the bottom). If you answered yes to both these questions, WeMo will work for you.\n\nYou should have basic electrical wiring knowledge to do this. My house was built in 1935 so the wiring can be unusual - I ended up having to create a pigtail for the neutral wires, which obviously requires wire and additional wire nuts. However, if your home is more recent this should be a straightforward job."}

I have a 100 year old house, that was renovated 40 years ago. After removing asbestos and paneling, I installed new recessed lighting where I had none before. My luck involved having already purchased dimmable lights, and deciding to have two switches control different parts of the room. Both switches were on the line coming from the power source, so I had a neutral (white) line available.\n\nConnecting to my CenturyLink Wi-Fi router worked without a hitch. Somewhere in there I entered the Wi-Fi password; and the WeMo iPhone App found both switches, allowed me to connect to them and rename them to meaningful names. When I downloaded the app to another phone in the household, it immediately found both switches and worked as well as the on the first phone.\n\nThe Smart features of the switches work as advertised. I can control them from my phone, even when away from the house I (I'm not sure how secure that is.) Full control of the dimming feature works, and I can schedule the lights to go on or off in any manner imaginable. Even using the switches in \"dumb\" mode (e.g., pressing the light switch) has a smart feature -- the switches work together to act as a three-way switch for all the lights in the room.\n\nThese are my first attempts at Smart appliances in the house, but I'm happy with both the installation and the usage. I'm already thinking of other places in the house that can use a Smart switch."}

To be fair, the new mini switch worked flawlessly for 3 1/2 months. I started having some minor issues and deleted the mini switch to add it back fresh to the network. So I thought. The switch fails to connect to my network, either one of them. To add insult to injury, it implies that my password is wrong. I am well aware of what my passwords are and I'm entering them correctly. Dig a bit deeper in the forums and find this is a problem that a number of people are having. Calling Belk in support line is a joke. If you can find them, get the older style swith and you might be able to avoid these issues. Many people think this might be associated to firmware updates, but I don't think mine is. My switch went from working perfectly to unusable in the space of an hour or less. I have no proof that Wemo is being underhanded with their customers, but it seems a bit strange that these mini switches are now available for under $40, but the refurbished old style (larger) switches are selling for $60 or more dollars. You can almost forget about reaching them for support over the phone, much less a return under warranty.

You'll waste precious time of your life", "Text": "Two years ago, after reading some positive reviews, I decided to try these Wemo products that seemed promising and more versatile than the X10 modules I had to control lights around the house. Sadly, since the arrival of LED lights, the X10 system I was using was no longer compatible and thus I had to find a new option. Until recently, I had a very irritating relationship with these Wemo switches because every time that a power outage occurred (at least 8-10 times a year in our region) my switches wouldn't reconnect and I had to spend at least half an hour doing numerous attempts to link each of them to my Wi-Fi. During these two years, I spent countless hours reading all FAQs on Wemo's web site and printed all possible solutions and tried them all. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't. At that point I was ready to throw everything in the garbage but had found nothing better as a replacement.\n\nBut since the past three months and two power outages, I did not encounter any issues. I thought that maybe Wemo had found a way to resolve the connection issues so many customers had experienced and complained about and since Christmas is coming soon, I thought that adding a Wemo Mini plug would be practical to control the lights in the Christmas tree. So I purchased one and tried to install it to confirm that Wemo had done their homeworks. Unfortunately, sitting only 3 feet apart from my router, the damn thing was unable to connect to my network and after 6 attempts and one hour of patience, I gave up. It is unconceivable in my opinion, that those expensive products are not more reliable and robust, as the X10 is. I wouldn't trust to connect an alarm or a thermostat to a Wemo product.\n\nSo now I'm back to square one, looking for another lighting control system. I read reviews on Z-Wave and Zigbee hubs that are supposed to be more stable and performant but they have their drawbacks too. Some people complain about the same issues I had with the Wemo. It is discouraging to note that even though the technology becomes more powerful day after day, gone are the days of the plug and play!"}

Initial set up of the Wemo mini plug was marred by firmware update. The update reported it was successful but actually failed to apply as indicated on the properties page for the switch. After the update the behavior was inconsistent and the switch would frequently fail to turn back on after being turned off. Tried several troubleshooting steps and finally returned for a replacement. The replacement would not do a firmware update from any device except a Samsung tablet running android v6. After the firmware update the replacement device seems to work correctly when being controlled, locally or remotely, via dedicated app. Haven't tried any features using IFTTT, Alexa or NEST.\n\nOne troublesome observation is that the device that was returned still shows up (grayed out) in the WeMo interface even though it was wiped via the app before returning. There is no way to remove it, only hide -- and the missing device will pop back up the next time the app is opened after phone/tab has been rebooted. Belkin requires an email with name, phone, address, etc. be sent for an engineer to contact you to permanently unlink any unused device(s) from the account. There is something not quite right about the way they have designed the security infrastructure if they have to manually manage these types of activities on the back end. The consumer should be able to de-register or re-register the device on their own and return it to the base factory firmware. Searching the WeMo forums shows several posts relating to the scenario and that this condition has existed since 2015. Not sure it would be wise to use one of these if it has been previously deployed by someone else, since there is no way to know exactly what is going on behind the scenes with the cloud services and device activation.\n\nBottom line: Decent smart device with buggy firmware deployment. Odd security model that suggests the devices might be suspect if redeployed by a secondary consumer."}

The Hub used to connect everything for home automation and the Echo products more for voice activated actions. That said, the component of my system I've left for last were the lights because with my lifestyle, they're more a \"nice to have\" as opposed to a necessity like locks and A/C.\n\nAlthough this doesn't work with Wink, the Alexa, Nest, and IFTTT integrations sold me - not to mention the design is sharp/modern. As some of the users mentioned, you do need a small bit of knowledge about networks as it connects to your WiFi but it's all pretty rudimentary.\n\nThe part most difficult for me was installation - which is my reason for 4 stars instead of 5. First, it only works with single switches - with so many houses using 3-way switches, I'm shocked they haven't updated this. This also limits me to only two locations in my house I was able to install this. Secondly, the wiring examples and walkthrough wasn't even close to how my wiring was setup. Through trial and error though, I was able to get it working but it took much longer than expected.\n\nIt was a little bit of a pain, but the end result was a sharp looking WiFi light switch that works great!"}

Also I wish there was a way to separate or set permissions on each plug, because anyone who has the wemo app and is connected to your wifi can control every wemo device the app discovers.

It was one of the best sellers on Amazon and seemed to have a decent rating as far as smart plugs go. What I wound up getting was one of the most disappointing tech experiences I can ever recall having.\n\nOut of the box, there are effectively no instructions other than to check out the Wemo website, which is basically an ad for more Wemo products. Once you figure out that you need to install the mobile app, you can start *attempting* to get this thing to connect to wifi. I say attempting, because, despite sitting in the same room as the access point, it consistently refuses to connect to anything.\n\nAfter Googling and finding a lot of similar problem reports (blinking amber light, no connectivity), I quickly mastered the \"reset\" technique. I was able to achieve a wifi connection after resetting and reconfiguring, and at one point after a number of attempts, got it fully working (I thought). It sat for maybe an hour or two, until I went to show my spouse the new gadget... and found it had fallen off the network. Back to square one.\n\nThe app at one point managed to tell me there was a firmware update available. It didn't offer this the first few times through setup, and there's no way to check directly, but it didn't matter, because the firmware update never successfully installed. It would start installing, then inevitably wind up back in \"no network\" blinking mode until you again reset it and started the whole process over again. Maybe the firmware update would have made it work better... no way to tell.\n\nAs far as the (Android) app goes, it's fairly awful in and of itself. Clunky UI, hard to navigate, lots of freezing, and just severely buggy. The poor rating in the Play Store suggests I'm not alone in feeling this way.\n\nDespite a successful career in technology that includes mobile support and networking, after several hours I could not get this device to work. It's shocking to me that they would bring such a poorly executed product to market. I'm not the kind of person who returns products after purchasing, but I returned this as unusable. I'll be avoiding Wemo products in the future."}

Absolutely horrible product. I don't have the time to go over everything, so lets talk about just a few. First, it doesn't work with every LED bulb. You have to get a specific type of LED bulb for this to work. At least, that's what customer service at Wemo told me. I don't believe that to be true, but it didn't work with my bulbs. The flicker was so frustrating. And it doesn't dim all the way. 1% brightness apparently means that you could read a package insert of a drug product clearly from a distance. If I compare it to dimming on my old standard dimmer switch...1% brightness on Wemo was equivalent to about 75% brightness (only dimmed by 25%). That is not true dimming. Oh...check out how they describe it in the ad: \"Wemo Dimmer will optimize the dimming range to suit the specific type of bulb you\u2019re using. Whether you\u2019re using LEDs, CFLs, or incandescent bulbs, the dimmer delivers the maximum dimming range with no flickering.\"\n\nWrong on the dimming. Wrong on the bulbs. Wrong on the flickering.\n\nOh, and don't get me started on customer service. First, they made me run up and down (dimmer in basement) to get my wifi info, and I kept telling them, that its not a wifi issue. It has to do with the lights. I was connected just fine to the dimmer. But I had to give them so much information about my router and wifi settings, it was ridiculous. Also, its not pronounced \"incadent\"...its \"incandescent\"....and no one says LED as \"led\"...you're supposed to use the letters only and say L-E-D. I lost it after the 10th time of her saying \"led.\"\n\nAnyway...horrible product..horrible horrible horrible customer service. Nothing brought me more joy than to pack this back up and ship it back."}

Easy to set up, work anywhere in my house, etc. This little bugger was nearly impossible to set up. Didn't like my WIFI settings (even though the other switches had no issue with them). I ended up having to change a bunch of things on my router via trial and error while reading message board suggestions. I did finally get it to connect and set up, but the WIFI range on it is sub-par when compared to the older models. I think i'll be able to swap it out with one of the larger ones that's closer to my router in the house to solve the issue, but you'd think with iterative \"improvements\" being made that this would be a superior product to the older model, but so far the only benefit this one has over the older model is the form factor.\n\nBelkin/WMO, You all might also consider making the plug for these on the sides of the switch. One thing I don't like about any of these is that it adds a tremendous thickness to the wall-plate causing some potential issues with furniture placement against walls. A built-in dimmer function would be welcome as well. I use two of these in my kids rooms to control their night lights and would love to be able to adjust the brightness as well as the on-off time.\n\nOverall, I love WEMO products, but this just falls way short of my expectations based on everything else I own."}

I've moved it somewhere it's easy to do that as it's completely useless if you can't get to it easily. I've searched online and I see others having this issue, but I can't seem to find a solution.

Customer service was helpful, however, I wish they could have resolved the issue with one phone call. The persistent need to call me back turned into an annoying game of phone-tag but my problem was solved. I received a new unit that installed easily. Setting up became a problem because the app crashed on my during setup. I contacted Technical Support, which was helpful.\n\n**Quick tip: The \"reset button\" in the FAQ and online support is not the actual button you press to turn the light on and off nor is it the slide bar to adjust intensity. For me, I had to remove the face-plate and it is the transparent plastic piece that the light transmits color through. I tried to reset and fix the syncing issue on my own but got hung up thinking it wouldn't reset. Once tech support told me it was the transparent plastic, I was able to reset the dimmer as instructed in the online support. I upgraded my review from 1 star to 4 stars because I like the functionality of the switch, its appearance, convenience and technical/customer support made the effort to assist with my difficulties.\n\nJunk. Don't waste your money. This item seems like a great device. First off, the box is way too large. It barely fit in the box in my wall. After finally figuring out how to fit it in the wall good enough, I admit that I was relieved at its pleasant appearance. That was short-lived ,however, when it shorted out after only a few weeks of use for no reason at all. I had to switch back to a standard dimmer switch to get my lights back on. For about $80, this is not worth it. I will look into other options and feel others should know about this products flaws."}

I tried my Samsung Smart Things hub and it won't find the dimmer switch automatically either, so I tried to enter the switch manually. The Smart Things app doesn't have the Wemo dimmer switch listed. They claim that Wemo works with Smart Things. I have purchased a lot of Insight switches and recently the dimmers and it's been a hit and many misses situation. Wemo's app is terrible. Difficult to use and little to no options to solve a difficulty. I am done with Wemo and will no longer purchase any more of their products."}

{"Author": "NicbachDVM", "Date": "on September 27, 2017", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Nice light switch but I prefer the Lutron ones over Wemo", "Text": "This is my first Wemo product. I've held out because they are more expensive than other competing brands. I'm not sure if it's because they were one of the first to market, but I feel they haven't stayed competitive on price vs. function. There have been complaints of connectivity issues, needing to reset devices, etc. on other Wemo products.\n\nThis switch is for a single pole light only (e.g. one switch). It's not meant to be used in a 3-way application. Your switch MUST have a neutral wire or this will not work (most do these days but it depends on the age of your home). If you're unsure about any of this, call an electrician.\n\nI've installed dozens of smart switches over the past couple years and this is as easy as the rest are to install. Follow the clear instructions on how to connect the light, download the app, connect to the switch, and you're done. The app walks you through how to connect, so don't worry that you won't know how to do it. The instructions are otherwise pretty bad, so you may be relying on friends and videos if you get stuck.\n\nMake sure you switch off the breaker to the switch prior to installation! I've shocked myself too many times in the past and it's never fun. It comes with a single decora wall plate cover (the wide one). If you are installing this in a series (e.g. 3 kitchen light switches all next to each other) you can buy combination plates just about anywhere. Remember to cover any exposed wiring with electrical tape, or you will cause an arc/short in the switch and trip the breaker. This could lead to a fire, so be mindful!\n\nI found the dimming to work well, though the lowest setting made it extremely dark. There occasionally is a flicker with the LED bulbs I've been using, I just switch it on and off again and it's working fine now.\n\nControlling it with Alexa is great and easy to set up. Just enable the Wemo skill in Alexa and she takes care of the rest. I use my app when I don't want to shout at Alexa, and it's worked out quite well. I've had a couple drops in connection, but nothing too bad.\n\nFor the price, Lutron switches offer a better value. Most of my switches are Lutron smart switches, and I have never had a problem with them. Plus, they're half the price of these switches and accomplish the same thing. Either way, smart switches are amazing."}

{"Author": "Stan Durbin", "Date": "on September 24, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Very handy for the right situation", "Text": "This is a very neat gadget. The product is designed such that it occupies only one space of an outlet allowing another electrical device to be plugged into the other of a two plug outlet. After downloading the iPhone app, the device was quite easy to set up using the app. Enabling the smart plug to be controlled by Echo was not quite as straightforward, requiring me to first enable the \"skill\", then searching for and enabling the smart plug. It wasn't rocket science but might be a bit frustrating for novices. I used the smart plug to control my living room table lamp which might seem unnecessary but it allows me to ensure the light is on for our dog while we're away. The smart plug conveniently has a physical power button that can control the power directly for times when we're sitting beside the lamp. Alternatively, I can tell Alexa to turn on (or off) the \"living room light\" from nearly anywhere in the house or can use the WEMO app to control the light from anywhere I have a WiFi or cellular signal, very convenient. One down side is it won't work well for devices that require constant power for a standby mode because it (obviously) won't provide any power when switched off. However, for devices that will automatically turn back on to the desired state when power is turned on, the smart plug should work well and, in some cases such as a garage door opener with memory, may provide additional security by preventing the device from from being operated remotely while in the powered off state. I look forward to finding other uses for the WEMO smart plugs and highly recommend it."}

Wemo's product line is stylish and functional. Installation instructions is straightforward and the process itself was a breeze. Important step to remember is the neutral wire must be connected. Connection to the Wemo app was also easy. Found the switch's Wifi relatively quickly. This all works perfectly with the Wemo app.\n\nIntegration with Google Assistant is not as smooth. Connection with Google Assistant is not immediate. It took many tries for Google to find the Wemo devices. After some time, we gave up on connecting via iOS and connected with Android. Once connected Google Assistant can control the dimmer switch by voice. About 60% of the time, the Google Assistant can not find it which was very frustrating. So we deleted the devices from Google Home and set it up again. This time iOS connected first. It seems the name assigned on the Wemo app needs to be the same name on the Google app. That could be the cause of the unrecognized device.\n\nIntegration with IFTTT also works as advertised. The rules created works well with Google. I do have a suggestion for the Wemo folks, the dimmer switch is missing the \"number\" ingredient so I can say, \"Hey Google, set the Wemo dimmer at #\". Currently, I believe I would need to set a IFTTT rule for each incremental setting which is painful."}

I decided to take it slowly, ordering one or two at a time. I now have six with a seventh coming.\nSet up was effortless. The process of connecting to Wi-Fi, naming the switch, connecting to Alexa, setting up single lamps, joining a group, and testing it took five minutes for the first lamp and with practice now takes three minutes. I easily set up groups of lamps controlled by a single command.\nI have not tried timed lamps but it looks simple. I have not tried IFTTT. I did not download the firmware update since everything was working.\nHowever, I did try causing trouble. I unplugged a switch and plugged it back in. I changed the name of a switch. I turned off the Wi-Fi and then turned it back on. I set up switches on different floors of the house than the router or the Echo. At no time could I get any of the switches to fail.\nThe oldest one I have is less than two weeks old, so there is the possibility of failure in the long run. Otherwise I am truly baffled at why some people have had so much trouble.\n\nUpdate: I ordered two more plugs, numbers 8 and 9. This time I had problems. They would not detect the Wi-Fi. I recycled the plugs and the Wi-Fi to no avail. I unplugged all of the previous 7 plugs, as recommended by another reviewer, but still could not get the new ones to connect. I tried several more times over a period of six hours. I saw why others gave up at this point but i was encouraged to persist because the first 7 worked. Suddenly the new ones connected. I'm truly not sure why. However, a month has gone by and all 9 are operating perfectly. Once again I recycled the Wi-Fi and unplugged the plugs but could not get anything to fail. Clearly these plugs have quirks, but now everything works: Alexa, the Wemo app and the rules. My only sure advice is to persist and you will be rewarded with eventual success."}

The selling point and feature I wanted is the scheduled on/off.\n\nI wish I could say installation was a breeze. Wiring these in was pretty easy (even considering two of them were wired in series with a 3-way switch)., but they refused to connect to the router I have (setup fails, every single time). I'm still not sure what the compatibility problem is, but hours of troubleshooting would not get these to work with my router, although I suspect it has something to do with the version of WPA these use. My frustration was compounded by the fact that my router is ISP provided and the settings I have access to from the web interface are limited. I have the technical ability to access the advanced interface not intended for customers, but I can't imagine a typical customer would.\n\nI ended up having to pull out an old router and put it in bridge mode, specifically to connect to these. They work now (and are awesome) but I'm running two separate wireless routers, a setup I consider to be a nearly unacceptable workaround to make these switches work.\n\nIntegration with Alexa works fine, with the expected caveat that you must specify which light you are talking about by whatever you named it when you set it up, so try to avoid being too creative or complex with your names if you intend to use this feature (i.e. \"front garage porch right side light\" is not a good name).\n\nConnection issues aside, these are pretty cool."}

Example: If you pair it with a TV - yes you can turn off the TV from your phone (which by the way why wouldn't you just use the remote?!) or by voice such as Amazon Alexa. However, if you ask Alexa to turn the TV back on it will simply return the power the TV but as far as switching the TV display ON that is something different entirely. With that said this type of device works best with SIMPLE on/off appliances i.e. a fan, a lamp, Christmas lights you still have up in the summer, a cotton candy machine that you bought for yourself and live with the guilt of every single day save for the 5 minutes you treat yourself to some freshly spun cotton candy...The phone app is relatively simple to navigate and the pairing with Alexa is just as simple as well. Just know what you're buying and make sure you think it through so you're not disappointed when it can't wash, season, and baste your rotisserie chicken in the oven and the click of a button on your phone...I should've know better..."}

Now that was a bold claim, but I gave this switch a shot anyway. I have your standard GE dimmable LED recessed lights installed. And sure, the lights turn on and dim beautifully. Sadly, they also hum annoyingly at all light levels. Maybe this switch is defective (that seems to happen a lot from the reviews I've read). Either way, this is one is going back.\n\nUpdate 6/25/2018 - I figured I'd give these another shot. They seem to have improved somewhat, but you have to get one that actually works. By works, I mean you can actually connect to it over Wifi. Without that, it's an expensive 'dumb' dimmer that flashes annoyingly.\n\nOf the 5 of these I've installed, 3 had to be returned due to issues. The other 2 worked without issue right out of the box. My only complaint is that one (of those that worked at all) hums slightly, though not an severely as I experienced in my earlier review. The other doesn't hum at all. Both installs use four of the same type of lights...so I have no idea.\n\nIt would seem they continue to be plagued by awful quality control.

{"Author": "G. Brown", "Date": "on September 10, 2017", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Decent Hardware, Lousy Software", "Text": "I'm on a smart home kick, having installed a smart sprinkler controller, pool controller and a couple of thermostats in the last couple of months. Last weekend I had some time and figured I'd switch out the dumb timer on my porch light with something a little smarter. (Full disclosure, I picked the Wemo switch at my local big box hardware store since it was a spur of the moment project.) Reviews for the Wemo switch were good overall and I didn't want a hub which is required by some Wemo competitors since I'm only looking to replace one or two switches in total, so I pulled the trigger on the Wemo. It took me a week of frustration before I could finally get it to perform the simple task of switching on 30 minutes before sunset and switching off at a set time - probably one of the most common use cases for this device.\n\nI got the Wemo switch home and installed the hardware in less than ten minutes. Though I struggled to interpret the icons on the two black wires, the wiring diagram in the packaging made it easy to determine which wire served what purpose. I even got the Wemo connected to my wifi network with relative ease, though it did take a trip to the breaker panel to get it right. Once it was configured, I was able to turn the light on and off from my phone with no problem. Simple so far. Then came the hard part - setting the schedule.\n\nWemo's software interface is fine - it's easy enough to figure out how to set a schedule. Unfortunately the software is buggy. My ideal configuration was to go on 30 minutes before sunset and off at midnight. Simple enough, so I set it and waited till sunset to watch the light switch on. Dark comes and the light is still off. Checking the Wemo app shows the programmed schedule is active, but the light is definitely off. No error messages, no nothing. So, I turn it on through the Wemo app and go to bed. In the morning, the light is still on, not having switched off at midnight. The Wemo app says the program is inactive - still no error messages. So, I read the Wemo forum (lots of complaints about scheduling bugs), search the internet, and run through the tricks I find. I reset the Wemo switch through the software, uninstall the app, reset the device at the circuit breaker, sacrifice a goat. All to no joy. On the verge of giving up, I see a mention on the Wemo forums about problems with scheduling related to the end time set in the schedule. On a hunch, I change the off time from midnight to 11:59. Jackpot. The light now works with no problems - it just took me a week to figure out what was going on.\n\nThe problems I had with the Wemo switch reflect fundamental programming errors for common uses cases. I expected better from a device with such high review.\n\nTL;DR: The Wemo switch works fine, but lack of error messages and buggy software prevent me from recommending it."}

I haven't had a chance to explore using them until recently. As many other reviewers have stated, my Wemo mini plugs will not allow me to save any rules. I did a web search, and many other users have been having the same problem, particularly from iPhones. There is no way to try to make rules on the website or on an iPad. So the plugs have pretty much become an expensive way to remotely turn on/off my lamps. Without being able to save rules, I cannot have them turn on automatically according to a schedule or according to sunset or turn off according to bedtime, etc. What a waste of money. I can't even return them now. Belkin technical support gives people the run around (usual...reset the password, reset router, reset phone) and they have yet to come up with a firmware solution.\n\nUPDATE 10-11-2017. Okay, I think I figured out how to get the thing to work properly. After installing the Wemo and getting the app up and running, the Wemo will do a firmware update. You would think that this is the end of the install process but it isn\u2019t. After the firmware update, unplug the Wemo, and plug it back in while holding the power button. This will do a factory reset. After doing this process, the device now allows me to save rules. Finally!"}

{"Author": "J. Langert", "Date": "on September 7, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great Purchase", "Text": "Love these light switches.\n\nI installed one in my kitchen, and one in the living room, both near each other. Installation is quite simple, and directions are quite clear. You DO need to make sure that your wiring has a ground wire, but for most homes this isn't an issue. This comes with some easy to use wire nuts to make the connections. The only difficulty can be that this switch has a fairly good sized box to squeeze into the electrical box in the wall, which can be done, but does take a bit of planning and reorganizing of the wires, especially in a multi-gang switch area. I initially had some trouble fitting this next to a dimmer switch (which has wings on it to bleed off the heat generated more easily). I had to do some research before removing the metal wings on the dimmer switch. Overall, easy enough installation, that even an electrical novice like myself handled without issue.\n\nThe setup of the switch is not too bad, and runs through the Wemo app. However, you do need to tell your phone to stay connected to the wifi signal generated by the switch (for setup only), since t tries to disconnect when this wifi signal does not allow internet access. Once set up, it will auto update firmware, which sometimes fails, and you may need to help it try again. The Wemo app is a bit dated, but it has been a bit improved since I initially purchased the switch. It still takes too long to open the app directly, and it initially did not have \"widgets\" to allow turning on/off the switches from your phone's main screen (instead of opening the app, waiting, waiting, waiting, and then clicking the button). Now that it has widgets built in, I will note that the widgets sometimes don't update in real time too well (lights will show off when on, etc). This is fixed by opening the app itself which forces a status update.\n\nIntegrated well into Alexa/Google. Easily found by my Amazon Alexa app, and no linking of accounts needed to get working. I can ask for individual lights to turn on and off, or set groups in the Alexa app. I don't have a Google Home, but my android phone can also control the lights easily. Overall, this is the single BEST aspect of this device, and was worth every penny for this switch. Walk into the kitchen, ask for the lights on, and its done quickly. Especially helpful with full hands or when cooking.\n\nBottom line, I would definitely purchase again. I have even bought 2 additional plug switches for my bedroom, to work with an Echo Dot up there. Great to turn off the lights without having to get out of bed..."}

He has an Amazon Echo Dot so now with Alexa he can verbally command the lights on, off, or anywhere in-between. This is no small deal for him. It is a life changer.\n\nI chose the WEMO because I did not want to invest in a system which requires a \u201cbridge\u201d device, at least not yet. I also use bright LED Bulbs in the room with a color temperature I like. Smart-bulbs tend not to be as bright and/or have the same color temperature. For me, this choice allowed me to have full control of the light in my fixture.\n\nI chose the dimmer rather than the switch because I wanted my son to have more versatility than just on-off. The extra cost for dimming was worth it.\n\nInstallation was very straightforward. The WEMO Dimmer is well labeled with colored wires. Once I determined the LINE from the LOAD wires, it was just a matter of attaching the wires.\n\nOnce attached, I configured with the WEMO app. It tunes itself for the type of bulbs to avoid flicker with the LED bulbs.\n\nMy son added the WEMO skill to the Amazon Echo Dot, and then added the Device to the Echo.\n\nFrom that moment on he was in business.\n\nMy son no longer asks for assistance with the lights. He also likes the wall switch controller when he is near the switch."}

All downhill from there. As often as every 25 minutes, it just locks up/freezes and will not react to pressing the button on the dimmer or to commands from the app. Normally you would reset the device by pressing and holding the button but since it does not recognize the button, this doesn't work and the only way to get it functioning again is to turn circuit breaker off and back on. Which, of course, affects other things on the circuit. After two days of chat with Belkin (at first they wanted me to pay an electrician to come check my connections!!!) they finally agreed the item was defective. Have to PAY to ship it back to them to get a replacement. Would return to Amazon but item currently not available from Amazon except from sellers charging $32 - $52 MORE than I paid originally (I paid Mfr Retail- 79.99) - ridiculous situation. Wasted ridiculous amount of time on this. Oh, and if you can get anything on Belkin website to work right, you are doing better than me - only browser that sort of worked with their tech support and other features was Chrome and that was still quirky. Save yourself a lot of hassle. Don't go down this rabbit hole. UPDATE: Replacement doesn't work either!!! It is in same room as WiFi router and the ONLY time I can access it from the phone app is when my phone is connected to same wifi - otherwise I get \"Device not detected.\" Going to trash this wasted money device and Give TP-Link a try."}

Hookup is no more complicated than any other light or dimmer switch and syncing with Alexander was easy. The price is not right though. I could have bought four dimmable Hue smart lights for slightly more than I paid for this one switch and way less than the Wemo dimmable switch. If I had had fewer issues with the Hue setup I probably would have gone that route except I have absolutely no need for this particular bank of lights to dim. I had one freaky issue. I reused my original wall plate because it was a duplex and the wall plate actually depressed the reset/restart switch and I couldn't connect until I removed and reinstalled the plate.\nMid January update. I'm expecting my second order in two days. Please note this review for the non dimmable light switch. They lump all the products together, which is not helpful. Smart bulbs have their place but you are limited to voice or phone control even when you are standing right next to the switch. Using the Wemo switch doesn't interfere with still using all the other methods. Totally compatible with Alexa. I've had my first several months now and of my smart devices this one is by far the most stable. I think it's over priced and I will never buy a dimmable switch because of that."}

{"Author": "Chuck", "Date": "on September 7, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Flawless install and setup", "Text": "I read all the negative reviews on WEMO but decided to try out the platform with an initial purchase of two dimmers and one plug. So far so good. Installation was a snap and I ran into no difficulties at all. The dimmers have updated their firmware twice within 48 hours and the plug just once. They reconnected to the WLAN just fine. The app is adequate. Based on this success I intend to expand with additional dimmers in a week or so and I'll update my review then. The reason I chose wemo over other platforms was that my house is on the large size and I already have numerous apple router extenders so that the WLAN reaches all corners of the home. Since WEMO operates over the WLAN it takes advantage of that investment in router expanders. If I went with my next choice Caseta - it operates over its own proprietary channel that has only a 30 foot radius. The first component (switch or plug) that you install with caseta operates as an expander, but that will only then give you another 15 feet of radius in one direction. So if you have a home that is longer than 45' from your router in any direction, Caseta will not work. That's why I went with Wemo and for now am happy with the decision. (I have other home automation technologies already deployed [NEST Thermostats, Cameras and Smoke detectors, RACHIO sprinklers, RING doorbell, HONEYWELL Security, ACURITR temp alerts, and IFTT] and had left the lighting solution till last given the many alternatives and required research)."}

I had a friend install it for me, and there was no issue with the wiring. The instructions for installing were pretty straight forward, but I still felt mlre comfortable having someone with electrical background help.\n\nSetting up the app was a breeze. It connected right away, and I haven't run into any issues where it disconnects. The app is an awesome tool to have. I think we've all forgotten to turn the lights off before leaving for work, or not positive that we did. With the app, you can make sure they're off, and turn them off if not.\n\nThe other great thing about this is that because it connects to Alexa and Google home, you can set up schedules to turn the lights on or off at a set schedule. It's nice that the switch also has a night mode, if you are sensitive to light when trying to fall asleep.\n\nThe only thing I wish was different about this is that it's only a one way switch. If it was a three way switch, it would open more possibilities for which rooms you could install it in.\n\nAside from that one criticism, I don't have any others. It's a good product if you have the compatible electrical wiring, and works well in conjunction with the app and smart home capability. Adding the ability to control it from anywhere in the world with the app makes it even better. If you're looking to update your home, this is a great addition."}

{"Author": "Robert G. Coach", "Date": "on September 3, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Worse", "Text": "Update to my review. Yesterday, 3/5/2018 all my Wemo devices went off line. All of them. Not found. Not by Alexa nor by the Wemo app. I restarted all my devices. Nada. Not found. Restarted the wireless hub, no joy. NONE OF MY WEMO DEVICES ARE FOUND since the update.\n\nI am now in full up manual mode. And looking for a different solution. I cannot say this LOUD enough. Belkin devices are CRAP and they just dont work. They have been nothing but painful since I installed them two years ago. At least once a month they just go away and now apparently they are not coming back. DONT buy this if you are truly into home automation. Find another solution. I am\n\nI bought one last year and liked it. I went all in and now have most of the house on Wemo switches and outlets. They worked fine for many months until the latest firmware update. Now most of them are continually off line. I have reset, restarted and performed all the recommended updates including adding multiple wireless extenders throughout the house. They are performing so poorly that I am considering going back to pre Wemo days. Its just very frustrating. Had they left them alone I suspect that they would still be operating just fine. Now they are worthless and I can no longer recommend them.\n\nNovember 2017 update. For the past two months the Wemo app will not find any of my devices. Fortunately I have been able to control them using Alexa else I would have backed the truck up and recycled them all.\n\nThis first happened when Belkin did a firmware update. The last three firmware updates have killed connectivity. The first time I reconnected all 22 devices. It took a full day. I contacted Belkin support and got a terse replay \"not our fault\" basically don't call us we will call you NEVER.\n\nThe second time I managed to get the devices to connect after two days of resetting them by cycling the power. What a huge pain in the butt. Again, Belkin support said \"Not our fault, move along we are not interested in your little problems\"\n\nYesterday I was forced to do another firmware update cause I lost half the devices. You guessed it, they all went away again. I contacted Belkin support again. They told me to go away I was obviously not getting the message. They do not support their devices.\n\nI used to buy Belkin wireless but went away from them several years ago because they are unreliable, inconsistent and not supported.\n\nI tried to update the Wemo app. No update available. I tried controlling them through Alexa, but got the server not responding error message from Alexa. Interesting but for half the devices I could command them individually but not collectively via Alexa. Other room groups worked through Alexa normally but none worked through the Wemo app which did not find ANY of their own devices.\n\nI tried to enable the Wemo skill in Alexa but of course Wemo did not find my wireless network. Nuts. Alexa was turning them on and off using the new Alexa built in hub, but Wemo did not find them while connected to the same freaking network. Belkin is junk in my opinion only matched by their lack of support. Can I go with half a star?.\n\nI started going through the Wemo app trying different things. It was connected to my local wireless network but I deleted and reconnected it again. Like magic all of a sudden the devices showed up only three hours later!\n\nI highly recommend that if you do decide to go with Belkin you place the switches in a location where you can easily access it manually because I can guarantee that you will need to do so.\n\nUnless and until Belkin starts to support their devices and the reliability improves I recommend to my friends and family that they look at alternative solutions.\n\nI would say that I have had a bad experience but it does not raise to that level. :-)"}

{"Author": "wild animals", "Date": "on September 3, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "THIS IS WONDERFUL", "Text": "I am so stoked about this dimmer!\n\nI have a sleep disorder that has put me onto a 20-year search for rapid, in-place light activation, lol. I wake up terrified and want the light on immediately. A loooong time ago, my best friend bought me a The Clapper, and it was funny and I actually used it, but it didn't work that well. And no one wants to clap twice at 3 a.m. in the middle of a nightmare. I've found a lot of things that have helped (like the amber-colored night lights I got on Amazon) but I still wanted to be able to turn the light on from my bed. Also I really want to be able to adjust the lights remotely when I'm on vacation or at work.\n\nThis is almost perfect!!\n\nI don't have any of the home hub things, where you tell the computer lady to do stuff, but I do have a couple of Android devices and I paid the fee to use a first-class launcher that lets me add highly customized shortcuts to my device homepages. So turning the light on isn't immediate, but it's much faster and more attainable than trying to get up when you're still 90% asleep. I'm so glad they've developed this technology.\n\nHaving the light on full-bore isn't great for helping people get to sleep anyway, and with this switch, I can set the lights very low to help me get to sleep. So there's another feature that I'm glad to have. It's great.\n\nI procrastinated a long time on installing this, thinking I'd ask my dad to help, but not wanting him to spend all his spare time on other people's projects..... So I waited. Today, I went for it. I flipped the breaker and looked behind the light switch, and the wires weren't the same as in the Wemo diagram, so I closed it back up again. Watched some more videos. Deduced. Turned off the breaker again, pulled on some wires that had been stuck. Deduced. Decided that the two wires on one side of the switch must go on the same wire nut. Okay. So I connected everything. Turned on the breaker and the light switch. Nothing happened. Turned off the breaker. Must have the black wires the wrong way. Swapped them. Breaker on. VICTORY! I really hope I don't have it wrong. I know what I did is the kind of thing that makes electricians angry. But it is what it is. If you're going to order this, I'd suggest ordering a voltage detector, too, if you can, so you don't have to worry about whether the wires are really live or not.\n\nEven before installing the app, the dimmer is COOL. You hit the bottom to turn it off and on, and slide your finger up or down to dim or undim the light. Fortunately I have dimmable bulbs, apparently. Anyway, it's cool.\n\nAfter installing the switch, and gloating a little, I installed and connected the app, which couldn't have been easier. There's a dimmer and a master on/off on the main page, then you can create scenarios with on/off times, etc. You can also use IFTTT which I'm not into but is nice.\n\nI set the night-time dim for like 40% from 11pm to 730am. So from the app or switch, when I turn on/off the light, it goes to 40%. The only thing is that even if you try to slide your finger up the dimmer switch on the wall, it will stop at 40% (or whatever you chose), which is not ideal. But the cool thing is, the switch has tiny, TINY LEDs on the front, and if you have the light dimmed to 50%, the one tiny LED in the middle of the switch will light up. If it's set higher, one tiny LED will be lit further up. It shows you where you left the light at! It's really thoughtful design and I love it.\n\nOne thing I don't like about the light is that the screw holes are in thin plastic which is part of the main body. The wires are so bulky in the box that the Wemo switch almost doesn't fit in. I had to press really hard on it to get it to fit mostly in. I couldn't screw it all the way down, because the plastic would have broken. So the cover plate is like 1cm above the surface of the wall and it looks bad. Like not good. I wish the screws went through metal that was separate from the body of the switch, so you could replace it if you break it.\n\nAlso I think they could have given better instructions for more circumstances in the booklet. There are more-complete directions online, but I don't want to go online in the middle of installing the thing, with all the power turned off.\n\nBut I'm so stoked about this that I'm fine with all that (for now at least)! I love this gadget!"}

Dissassembly, installation and configuration went without a hitch. All 3 appears to be working as expected from a software perspective and still seem to be ok since a recent firmware update.\n\nThe bad:\n\nBeing the picky product engineer I am, I started noticing all the flaws and lack of attention to detail in this product.\n\n1. The device has a horrible click mechanism. I wanted to like it but when you click it, the plastic sweaks as it is moved and when it comes in contact with the actual switch mechanism you feel a very underwhelming \"click.\" Maybe newer ones don't have this issue but my units were brand new and factory sealed..\n\n2. The WIFI LED on the front is not centered. See the attached picture. Slooppy assembly and no QC on that part of the assembly IMO.\n\n3. Related to the Wifi LED, there is some interesting light leakage that happens around the edges of the switch when using the device at night. Sometimes all it takes is a little foam to block the light from escapting and keeping it to where it needs to be.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt's too early to tell. I'm worried the switch functionality will stop working because of the apparent lack of attention to that part of the product. Does this product warrent a $50 price tag? Not in my opinion."}

This device is not \"garbage.\" It does work -- and works well. However, the setup is a little time consuming when you want it to work with Amazon's Alexa.\n\nSetting up the Wemo device is quite simple thanks to the iOS app that I downloaded. It was basically the app that walked me through the installation. During the install, you will be asked to switch your WiFi settings over to the Wemo's WiFi in order to properly pair the device. After that is completed, the app and the device switches back to your home's WiFi network.\n\nPairing with Amazon Alexa is a little more complex. You need to go into the Alexa app -> Skills and locate/download the Wemo Skill. You then need to go to Smart Home -> Devices -> Discover Devices. The next step is to go to Smart Home -> Groups -> and create a group name. Say you are hooking up a fan. You would create a group called \"Fan.\" You then find the Wemo device and add it to that group.\n\nDoing this I was able to connect a fan to the plug. At night, when the bed gets hot, I simply say, \"Alexa, turn on fan\" and the fan automatically comes on.\n\nThis is a really great device, though I admit that the complexity of getting it set up and working with Alexa is a bit time-consuming. The rewards, however, are priceless.."}

That said, the app is missing a couple rules that could've made it better for me and how I'm using it. First off, it has a timer rule that allows you to set the amount of time you want it on, ok great. Then there's another rule you can set to specify exactly what times you want it on, also great. Not great, these cannot be used in conjunction with each other. In my case, I want to use the set times to turn on the lamp for the same time every night (7:15-8), however, when we're running late and it's after 8, I'd like to turn on the lamp and then use the timer rule for it to be on for 30 minutes. If I select this, it disables the set time rule and I have to remember to set it back. It's not the end of the world, but still. I also don't like the fact that I NEED my phone to turn the lamp on and off since the plug is hidden behind a dresser.

{"Author": "D. Paradice", "Date": "on August 27, 2017", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "I like it a lot but it's not quite 5 stars yet", "Text": "I have 6 Wemo outlets that I love, so I decided to try a smart dimmer switch on an LED ceiling light fixture (5 LED bulbs in the fixture). I like it. It works better than the \"dumb\" dimmer switch that was replaced, but it is not at 5 stars yet. Installation was easy. I did not guess correctly on the line and load wires, but the switch doesn't work at all if those are incorrect and there are only two possible ways to connect them, so fixing that was easy. Setup with the app was fairly easy. I think the calibration step would be much better if it was slowed down. Currently, the lights go from lowest setting to highest so fast that you can't really tell if the dimmer works at intermediate settings. I think it would be better if the user controlled that part of the setup (or at least had the option). My chief complaint is that while the lowest setting is good, the lights seem to be at full brightness when the dimmer is set for around 50% brightness. So, instead of having about 10 settings to work with, I really have about 5. Still, I'm positive on the product. I think Belkin will upgrade the firmware over time to improve the calibration. The switch definitely looks good and being able to control it manually or with the app is great."}

The pairing works really well and was super simple to set up. The only issue I had was that the physical size of the device was just a little too big for my 1950's era metal switch box. It also requires a deep box, especially if you have a lot of wire in the box. Once I got it in, smooth sailing."}

I tried restoring it to manufacturer condition which it did but no matter what I tried I couldn't get the app to connect. This seems to be a common problem for many reviewers and they blame it on the app being poorly developed. As far as I'm concerned I don't care where the problems lay, for the price of this thing it needs to work. This is the second wemo plug I had problems with. The first was a 1st generation plug that eventually connected but kept dropping the connection. I thought that since this was a newer generation problems had been resolved. But, obviously not. so I returned this one and would not recommend Wemo to anyone."}

This was the first Wemo Mini I have tried. After 2 hours of trying to get it to work, and another hour or two on the phone with customer service (which is located in the Philippines by the way), they eventually declared that my particular unit was defective. Plus, they were not willing to do anything to compensate me for my time or money. I will definitely NOT be buying another one of the Mini's."}
