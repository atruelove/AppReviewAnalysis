If I didn't live in an apartment, I would take a sledge hammer to it.\n\nMy apartment doesn't get cold. Ever. Cool somewhat. Cold no. I wake up and the temperature might be 75. I set the thermostat to 70. I come home at 6pm and the thermostat is still set at 70 but the actual temperature is 87. No kidding.\n\nEver call Nest support? Today I waited over an hour before I was disconnected. I have been on the phone numerous times with them -- and I tape all my calls --- and they always try to gaslight me. It's theit's be wires, it's the settings, it's me, it's defective, there's a schedule inside a schedule, it's because I haven't added Nest to my wifi (I've never gotten a good reason to do that, other than I can set my temp from the office, but if it won't work when I set it at home, what makes them think it will work from the office?)\n\nI think this is a cheap device google is selling to landlords who want to cut down on energy usage. If it's not that, it's just cheap. It doesn't work. Go to youtube and you'll find plenty of \"what to do about my nest\" videos.\n\ni don't know many of these glowing reviews are real. But mine definitely is."}

First issue: temperature is set to 75 degrees, cooling. Desktop thermostat reads 77.8 degrees when the unit comes on, and 72.3 when it shuts off. There's no way to adjust how long the unit will run. Second issue: the thermostat continues to read that the room temperature is 75 degrees, even though three different thermometers have all shown temperatures within .2 degrees of each other, ranging from 73.2 to 77.1 degrees. The app works well, and temperature selections are pushed quickly to the unit, however it doesn't actually work all that well to control the temperature in my house. I ended up purchasing the Honeywell wifi connected thermostat, which had other issues, and in the end, I went back to my trusty RTH7600D. I would not take the Nest plunge until they allow users to modify the range which the thermostat actually cools or heats. Plus, working on accuracy of the registered room temperature would be a wise idea as well."}

I really like the idea of it learning my schedule and adjusting accordingly. But summer is drawing to a close and NEST is still turning the thermostat temperature UP (to 75F) at NIGHT. Every night. And since I live in the Houston area and it's 80 degrees outside, I then wake up and wonder why I am sweating. I realize it's not a hot flash and it's the NEST again and have to get up and turn the thermostat back down. Did I mention this happens every. night? I keep the thermostat up during the day (80F) , I don't need my house cool during the day, but everyone in my family prefers to sleep at 72F. It's late August now and it's been in the 80's at night for months now....if it wouldn't cost be so much to replace my TWO NEST thermostats, I'd do it like a shot. I probably will bite that bullet in the next few months. If it breaks, you can BET it won't be replaced with another NEST."}

I followed the instruction and reset the wifi, it still stuck in the searching mode and can't pick up any wifi signal.

It's expensive, high tech, and top of the line. But it has been a disappointment. There's no hold feature. Probably so you don't forget and waste energy. But it will turn off all the time for no reason. Or the other way around. It will turn on even after you have adjusted the temperature to avoid it. I have turned off all the \"smart\" features and it still seems to do. The only way to stop it is to turkey turn it off.\n\nAnother problem is the software. I've had multiple times where it has randomly stopped charging. When this happens the wifi will cut out. After research it has been shown to a software issue that hasn't been fixed yet. I have also purchased the remote sensor and have had connection problems with it when using it just feet away.\n\nOn a positive side. The screen is a nice feature. I like how it displays the weather when walking by. Choosing which site to use would be nice. Something I'm sure nest would have to set up contracts with. The WiFi is obviously the main feature in a thermostat like this. And scheduling is a breeze using the app vs traditional thermostats.\n\nA fun, high tech gadget that needs to get the bugs worked out."}

Unfortunately it will change the temp setting on it's own and not to where I want it. I've tried turning off the nest sense and auto schedule to no avail. I don't really need A/C in my condo until it warms up to 78 or 79, below that I'll have the windows open. With thermostat set to 80 and windows open Nest will suddenly change to a setting of 75 turn on the A/C and start pumping energy dollars out the open windows forcing me to react and increase the setting to get it to turn off. The area where I live and on a mid floor in a condo building I don't need to run heat often unless there's a pretty good cold snap. Last December I was away on vacation and had put on the home away setting and set the thermostat low so the heat would only come on if the temp dropped to pretty cold in the unit. Once again Nest changed the temp setting I had placed it on. It turned out that month the only energy I used was when Nest turned the heat on when I was out of town, heating up an empty place. That experience may have been part of my inexperience with using it but it comes with virtually no instructions other than how to install. Information on their web site or phone app on using is pretty lousy. I regret buying the Nest thermostat."}
{"Author": "Kindle Customer", "Date": "on August 24, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "NEST does not work", "Text": "I bought my house in January and was excited to see the \"upgraded\" feature of the Nest system. We reset it to factory settings and followed the instructions which said to set it manually to the temperatures we wanted and after 1 week it would learn what we like and automatically set it for us. We live in Florida and have a bulldog so it is very important that the house stays cool enough. After 1 week the settings were never right. I continued to have it to adjust it even though I set it for the same exact thing every day. I did some research and found out that NEST is not always compatible with older AC units so I just figured that was the problem. In June we got a brand new Lennox 4 ton unit installed. One again we reset it to factory settings and set it for 77 each weekday morning and 74 every night at 10pm. It never learned and never worked. We did more research and made sure to go in and turn off the eco friendly feature which is basically a feature where Nest overrides what you set and makes it 2 degrees warmer to try and save you money. I can not have an 80 degree house during the day with a bulldog. Turning off that feature did not fix the problem. The bottom line is that this thing does whatever it wants and the company should be sued for making a product that is a fraud and a scam. I now have to invest more money to get a new thermostat or risk having my dog die while I am at work."}

No matter what I do, I cannot get it to work. It worked for the first few weeks I had it, then stopped. I've cleared cache, relogged in, reinstalled, and even went so far as to factory reset my phone. No go, it will not recognize when I leave or enter my home.\n\nSo I resorted to just manually setting it on ECO from my phone. But 15% of the time, this won't register. So a lot of times I will set this while walking out the door, only for it not to register, and now I just kept my home at 74F all day with NO ONE IN IT. What a waste!\n\nSo ultimately now I just use it like my regular thermostat. I set it high from the thermostat when I leave, and bring it back down when I arrive home - useless $220 spent for a nice digital view I guess. Sigh."}

{"Author": "Kirill B.", "Date": "on August 21, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Good product", "Text": "The product works as expected and I am very satisfied with the purchase. I compared it with competitors, found out that ecobee does not really support a connection for old thermostats which have 2 wires only (no common wire). I have an old heater and it only has 2 wires, W and R. There are many confusing answers on the internet in regards to whether this product would work with 2 wires, (when there is no Common wire). My experience proves that it does work with 2 wires only, I connected them as Rc and W1. Initially nothing worked, and thermostat was complaining that there is no power on the wire, this was because on my old thermostat the wires were mislabeled, i.e. I ended up connecting a wire that was labeled as W, to nest's Rc and the wire labeled as R, to W1. Now when everything is connected, I am fully satisfied, the product is simple to use and I did not notice any glitches. Also I was amazed that technical support works on weekends and very prompt. Please note that technical support was not actually able to resolve my \"reversed wires\" issue, the support referenced me to a \"certified installer\". But that's ok, at the end of the day I was able to figure out the issue myself."}

Opted into Rush Hour Rewards after receiving an email saying my energy provider was participating. Only to find out that they ARE NOT participating at all! Nest doesn't do due diligence to make sure you are with participating providers, despite their statements to the contrary. Then you can't opt out without calling pro support which takes 30 minutes. In addition, the program is trash since it doesn't take into consideration when users like me already have very sensible thermostat settings. For instance, I wouldn't have received rewards credit when my thermostat was already set at 81,and rush hour rewards wants to increase it to 83 (unbearable). This is considered the same as the next user who sets at 74 and gets increased to 76, which is ridiculous -- I am saving the grid energy ALL THE TIME, but get penalized when I can't stand 83 degrees, while the guy at 76 is getting rebates with a house cooler than mine is ever set!

If he's home (and I'm not) and leaves to take the dog out to potty for five minutes, the Nest won't come back from away status even when he's back in the house and walking in front of the thermostat. 2a) I can't find a way to program from the app. Due to issue #1, I want to manually program so this doesn't happen to him again. 2b) Our house is east/west facing and using the eco settings is a major pain. We need to use lower than 75 for our normal non-vacation away temperatures. If I could do my own programming this would be so helpful. 3) The app isn't as intuitive as I would like.

I'm sorry to report that they've been nothing but trouble from start to finish. They are easy enough to mount and wire, but everything is downhill from there.\n\nFirst of all, Nest puts an arbitrary limit on the number of Nest devices in an account. This unpublished, hidden limit is 20, so if you have a number of cameras, smoke detectors, etc. you will hit the limit fast. The first 'fix' Nest provided for this (to tell the app you are a business instead of a residence) failed. Their only fix was to set up the system as if it were 2 homes, and then constantly switch between them until the end of time. As I was stuck having already installed them, I had no choice but to accept this hack.\n\nOnce the therms were all installed, registered, and named with the app, the names started mysteriously disappearing. eventually all the thermostats I had conveniently named based upon their locations would lose their names and just display \"thermostat\" so I had no idea which zones I was activating. Resetting every thermostat to factory settings and repeating the entire installation process multiple times eventually solved this mystery (not thanks to Nest tech support), but then even stranger things started happening:\n\nOnce everything SEEMED to be working, I found that if I changed a thermostat setting from the App, the App would indicate that the change had been made, but in fact nothing had changed on the actual thermostat. This is with perfect wifi (verified 20MB/s with less than 100ms latency, tested right at the thermostat). Of course, the app reported that it was in contact with the thermostat (within the last minute) and could even read the thermostat's settings -it just never sent the temperature-change command to the thermostat. Even worse, there is no way the user could know that the change that was submitted via the app was ignored! Nest's proposed solution: Use the web interface instead of the app!\n\nEvery day I seem to experience more unusual behavior that can't be explained by nest. Today, several of my thermostats would not display the current room temperature at all, whereas other identical models, bought the same day and set up the identical way, would. In other cases, temperature would be displayed, but be totally inaccurate.\n\nI also find that Nest's purported 'time to reach target temp' feature is a total fail. In reality, it has no idea whatsoever how long it has to activate the heater to achieve the desired temperature. So if you have a slow-moving hydronic system like I have, the Nest overshoots the target temperature by 5-10 degrees. Thus if you use these thermostats, expect to wake up in a sweat to 80 degree room temperatures. Or just as bad, pre-heat your vacation home so it is warm when you arrive, only to find out that the heat was never turned on, despite what the app tells you.\n\nPersonally, I think these products should be recalled, though it I doubt it will happen. Someday perhaps Nest will work out all the bugs, but I suspect it will require swapping out all of your installed hardware.\n\nCaveat Emptor!"}

I was given a Nest by my power company for free. They give them out to willing customers to help reduce energy consumption during peak periods.\nInstallation was fairly straight forward. Although as we are shopping for a new heat pump I'm told by several HVAC guys my Nest won't work with their systems.\nBy far the most annoying \"feature\" was the \"self learning\", \"knows better than I do\" temp control. Unless you have a very regular schedule this is useless. For example, if I'm working on a project for a couple of weeks and start my day at 5 AM but out of the house by 5:05 AM it doesn't know that I don't want it to turn on the AC at 4:30. The cat jumping on the back of the couch triggers the motion detector, the temperatures it selects are strange, it thinks it can do a better job of setting a schedule than I can. Bottom line is my energy bill has doubled from the periods as last year.\nNow the unit doesn't even see my wifi. After going through the online troubleshooting guide and several chats to support I'm still without a properly functioning unit. So basically this Nest is serving me worse than the old standard time scheduIe unit that I replaced (also provided by my power company).\nI'm sure glad I didn't pay for this thing."}

After several attempts she had arranged to send me a new thermostat. She was extremely imformative and explained to me that it may be an issue with the WiFi chip. Since my system was under warranty she shipped a new one and all is well. The first rep I had spoken to obviously was not into customer satisfaction. People like Becca are an asset to the continuing success of a company.\n\nThe customer service for Nest products is the worst! I purchased this via Amazon and had it installed through Amazon\u2019s professional installation. Worked great for about 8 months or so. Then all of a sudden the thermostat stoped connecting to the WiFi network. And kept going on when it shouldn\u2019t , I followed all the normal troubleshooting advice to no avail. I finally caved and called nest to get further help. A representative came on line and was obviously distracted and was speaking in the background to someone else and then kept asking me to repeat myself. She then said she would connect me to someone who can assist me but wanted my first and last name which I attempted to give and she kept saying repeat that please. After 4 attempts I asked her to just connect my call which she refused to do and she hung up. I waited for almost 20 minutes. Never got I call back."}

This would have been fine because Nest was quick to replace it and things worked. Until just recently, I had my A/C die and I had noticed that heat was coming out when the A/C was supposed to be running. I replaced the air handler and outside unit b/c a valve had blown on the heat pump - only to find that heating was still happening. It turns out something in the Nest, either a bug, or a faulty mounting base is causing the AUX heater to run while my A/C was running. I have no idea how long this was going on for but I'm sure it isn't good for my A/C unit. I have not done complete analysis yet to see how much this was affecting my bill. Note to figure this out I used a temperature gun and pointed it at vents with the aux wire plugged in vs unplugged - I saw about a 10 degree difference.\n\nI'm raising my rating to 2 stars because I like Nest's software and the concept behind it. Also their support, when I have known there was an issue, has been helpful. I replaced the base on my unit and it is no longer running the heater. So it appears that all of this was due to a bad component - the battery issue may have been related to this as well. It's a shame because it's the cheapest component and probably should have been replaced with the thermostat the first time to rule it out as an issue."}

I started the chat with:\n\n\"Me: I have damaged the wire mount for my nest 3rd gen and need to order another\"\n\nAnd after being a nice guy going through 45 minutes of tech support... running here, checking this, mentioning (arguing really) several times it's not my HVAC unit, the tech finally tells me that they don't sell base units...\n\n1) I literally started the chat with \"I need a new base unit\" - you would think they could start with \"we don't sell those\"\n2) I showed them all the steps I took to troubleshoot this issue... I do tech support for a living. There's no way it could be my HVAC unit unless, as I told them, it's with two different units and the first unit who had the problem suddenly fixed the problem after the base was changed out... it's the base unit\n3) why don't they sell base units?!?!\n\nit's poor customer service all around... I have nest and I have Samsung Smartthings in my home. I'm switching the Ecobees this afternoon to use on my SmartThings system. This is not good for a company Google's size... seriously disappointed. May switch off their cameras soon too and get rid of Nest completely.\n\nSucks too because I really like the product itself..."}

I start my fan literally everyday for about 1 hour when I go to sleep to circulate the air and make some white noise and this need to be manually scheduled as the \"learning mode\" doesn't seem to learn that part by itself. Also had to disable the auto-away mode that is supposed to be an integral part of the energy-system as I would always come back to a super cold house. You basically have to set up your phone to detect if you are away and then it ignore your schedule if you are away and everyone need to be linked up for that to work.There's setting you can activate so that it start the heating in advance but by then, it would heat up half of the afternoon because the house was so cold. There is a way to deal wit hall those issue but its basically all manual scheduled stuff which I could do with my old \"dumb\" thermostat.\nAnd it's not always clear what temp it is activating at. Like for example, it would be set to heat when temp is lower than 23 degrees and would be off because presumably, the house was already at that temp. I would lower it to 22 degree and put it back up right away to 23 degree and it would keep heating up... I think I have read that there is a slight tolerance so that it doesn't keep going up and down but sometime it would be cold in winter and I would need to make it go down and up again so that it really keep the house at the temperature we set it to.\n\nIt's a really cool looking thermostats and it's nice to be able to control it from your phone but there is way cheaper thermostats that would allow you to do that.

It looked like a very useful accessory. It has proven to be useful, but with a major flaw: the thermostat runs off of the built-in battery, not off of the power supply by the HVAC unit. If the battery level gets low enough, your entire HVAC system will shut down until the battery is recharged. The thermostat will be dead with no indication of what caused it to fail. Mine showed a blinking red light on the dial that indicated it was recharging the battery, but it wasn\u2019t charging. Seven hours later my HVAC system was still down, in 100\u00b0 Texas heat.\n\nI\u2019d still recommend this product, with the warning that it can exhibit unexpected behavior if the thermostat has a power interruption.

I'm in Arizona so turning things up in the summer while away is not a great idea as it takes that much longer to cool your house to 76 when it is 115 out. I had to disable all smart leaning anything. I mainly bought this so I could set the temp when out of town (more than a day) and have the house cool down before I get home. It does this well, but my biggest grief with this is that you have no temperature confirm option. My kids and their awesome friends walk by and want to touch and twist it (It looks cool I get it), the temp changes right away. My old thermostat made you hold down a button before let you change the temp. They NEED a click to confirm option or something so it doesn\u2019t just change. I'm actually debating taking this back due to this one reason. I do know there is a lock feature, but that just lets you lock a 5 degree range the thermostat can be adjusted. 5 degrees is huge here in AZ."}

Not helpful for upstairs where a teen sleeps and their erratic schedule and summer versus school months confuse the \"learn your habits\" detection algorithm fails miserably.\nBeware the so called energy efficiency and reduced usage when your not home or during peak usage hours. The only way a thermostat can save you money on your bill is to move the temperature setting up for the AC in the summer and the heat down in the winter. That translates to a home to warm in the summer or too cold in the winter. This is not rocket science and is done with any programmable thermostat for 1/3 the price. Hooking this up to your network or Alexa? What's the point? if you are constantly interacting this thing and changing the setting, you are negating the supposed benefits above.\nMine was installed with a new AC replacement. I tried it and failed to see any benefit. It also went bell up after 11 months. First, it disconnected form my network and no matter what i tried I could not get it to reconnect/recognize the network. Customer support was useless. I left it with the setting intact and things seemed to be OK. Now, a few months later, it is regularly turning off due to requiring the date and time be reset. It is now only useful as a paperweight.\nGoing to purchase a good ole reliable Honeywell Programmable thermostat, set it and be done."}

I reset the temp manually to try and keep it bearable in my home but then Nest won't allow it and puts the temp back up to very uncomfortable levels.

I contacted Nest phone support three times, typically you have to wait for 45min to more than 1 hour to talk to someone. With their instructions, I had done all kinds of troubleshooting. To give them credit, their support technicians are super nice and patient, except for one who could not even understand the issue.

I accepted the suggestion and was ready to schedule a AC service, which would cost hundreds of dollars.

I did research on these and other smart thermostats before purchasing and learned that some of these thermostats will not work with a few atypical heating/cooling systems. That was good to know and I felt confident after using the Nest compatibility checker. It uses the existing thermostats wiring and terminal strip designators to make the determination. I really like the simple design of the Nest thermostat with out the backing plate. But that does require painting the wall after removing the old thermostat because the Nest is typically much smaller than the one being replaced. The Nest comes with a large white plastic backing plate - - but to me, then undermines the aesthetic beauty of the Nest.\n\nTake pictures from multiple angles and elevations of your old thermostate before you disconnect any of them. You will use these pictures for compatibility checking. If you decide to buy Next, be sure to hold on to those pictures because you will need them to wire up the Nest. The instructions were quite simple and the number of steps I needed to take to remove old thermostat and install Nest were very reasonable. Even configuring the Nest to work and configuring it to work on the internet with my iPhone were streamlined and simple.\n\nThe Nest will \"learn\" when you typically turn the temperature up and down for each day of the week. I use that feature on our upstairs Nest. For the main level, I chose to \"tell\" Nest what I already knew I wanted. We have and Alarm.com smart home and the Nest is not set-up to integrate with that: can't access the Nest thermostat from the Alarm.com app. However, the Nest app works fine and is simple. If you want to integrate a smart thermostat into Alarm.com, you can buy their specific thermostat on Amazon for about 1/2 the price of Nest. There is a third party that will provide the service of linking Nest thermostate to Alarm.com, but I'm not comfortable enough to use it. I'll be using the Nest app. If I every buy an Amazon dot or Alexa, I know the Nest thermostat will work with that. Oh, and Nest does not work with Siri or Apple's \"My Home\" app. If you are one of those people who likes to integrate everything into a single app, the Nest (or some apps) will become barriers to that quest.\n\nWhat I really like about Nest smart thermostat is the ability to see if \"someone\" (kids, dog, other) have been using the thermostat like a gas peddle (e.g. colder faster = turn thermostat down 'a lot'). Of course, when that happens, the thermostat gets forgotten and left at rediculous energy wasting settings. If I'm not at home, I can check and reset from my smart phone (Yippee!).\n\nIn terms of functionality, I like that the Nest not only controls air temperature, but I makes decisions to control humidity too if you want (less eco friendly thought) and it tries to balance comfort with cost. I noticed that it \"overcools\" a little more than our old Honeywell thermostat. I'm guessing that is to prevent starting/stopping the compressor so much. We've not used these for heating yet, but it did \"test\" well with our Trane 2-stage fan speed heating system. That is, the thermostat can operate a heating system that uses a two stage (two-speed) fan set-up with gas heat."}

This Nest does not operate by temperature setting alone, it uses motion as it's primary directive to adhere to thermostat settings. If it does not detect motion, it will not come on. It will however start cooling the moment it detects motion if the room temperature is above the thermostat set temperature. I think you're better off with a $40 thermostat that's been around since before Nest was an idea in some birds brain."}

When I moved to this house I brought my previous Nest with me (it was NOT included in the sale of that home as I liked it too much to leave it for my buyers - LOL!) . Because I travel often for business, I like the remote access to the thermostat - I am able to raise/lower temperatures remotely. This is especially important to me when I forget to change the thermostat before I leave the house. And more importantly in South Florida where I live, Nest allows me access the thermostat remotely so that I can lower the AC temperature while traveling back home, so that my house is cool upon my arrival. It was easy to install the Nest thermostat. The set-up was also very easy. And Nest includes clear instructions - and if you need help, they offer videos, FAQs and other forms of assistance. The phone App is great - very easy to set up and configure/control your Nest thermostat from anywhere!"}

There is no real manual control for it so you can\u2019t override it.

{"Author": "Kat", "Date": "on June 13, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "***WARNING*** This product will shut itself off on its own if left on the default settings.", "Text": "***WARNING*** The thermostat's default setting uses machine learning to decide when to be on or off, rather than just running as you last set it. So, leaving it set at a certain temperature before being gone all day does **not** mean that your home will be kept at that temperature unless you go out of your way to change the as-installed settings. By default, the thermostat's program -- not you -- determines when to run the AC. If the program decides to do so, it will automatically shut itself off entirely -- without you even touching it. If you're not home to turn it back on, and if it's summertime in a hot place, your home will become an oven.\n\nI was not warned of this when management installed these in everyone's apartment, and my pet suffered for it. Where we live, temperatures get above 100 degrees during the day, so it's critical that the AC be on all day. I set it at 76 degrees in the morning for my pet and left for the day. I thought it would just keep my apartment at that temperature (or very close to it) all day. Wrong. Instead, owing to a horrifically flawed algorithm, it shut itself off during the day. My apartment was nearly 90 degrees when I got home, and it was very humid, which made it even worse. That number alone might not seem alarming, but to a small, older pet in poor health, it can be devastating. I tried fixing this by not only turning off the eco setting but also using the Lock feature, thinking that meant the temperature setting couldn't be overridden by AI. Wrong again. (All that does is prevent anyone from tampering with the actual device.) The same thing happened the next day, this time because the thermostat determined that I wasn't home. Again, it didn't just stay as I left it. It decided to turn itself off, and there was nothing I could do about it unless I had changed the default settings ahead of time. (I didn't know about that second one until that happened.)\n\nI recommend downloading the Nest thermostat app on your phone if you're stuck with one of these yourself (even though I find it creepy to have yet another device soaking up my info and, worse, tracking when I'm home or away). Monitoring the thermostat compulsively is, apparently, your only line of defense if Nest decides to cook your pet."}

The issue is Nest only has a single motion sensor, so it can't tell if you're home if you happen to be on another level of your home -- or even in another room. (By the way, the new temperature sensors can't sense if you're home -- all they do is measure temperature.) If you're upstairs, the Nest downstairs will shut off all your climate control if you sleep in -- until you go downstairs to trigger the Nest to \"Home\". What's the point of having an automated system, if you have to do something to make it do what you want? You might as well save a couple hundred dollars and get a manual thermostat.\n\nGot an Ecobee recently, solves the above issues. I put Ecobee sensors in the basement and bedroom levels, done. Ecobee senses where you/family are and adjusts accordingly. It's also way easier to program if you want a set schedule for weekends or something.\n\nNest has more of a recognizable name, but Ecobee is the thermostat that gets the job done. I can't imagine why anyone, having tried both, would prefer Nest. Perhaps for aesthetic reasons? It's a perfect circle; however, both look pretty on the wall."}

We got home in time to watch my daughter's chinchilla die of heat stroke right before our eyes. She was devastated. I called Nest and went thru the troubleshooting process. The unit wasn't in eco mode, so it should not have turned off. The rep at Nest said he didn't know why it turned itself off. He also stated that it was probably a bad wifi chip. After 9 days, after calling twice to follow up, I called Nest to find that they had closed the case and there was no resolution. I was advised that the unit did \"what it was supposed to\" by going into eco mode, which was verified with the first rep I talked to that this was not the case. However, if the unit had connected to wifi, I could have monitored my home's temperature as I often did previously. So, I would implore you to not purchase this device.

The additional $200 (plus tax) for the common wire would need Nest approval and the technician said they many times are on hold a very long time also for that approval. The approved Nest technician will only run the common wire if it is uncomplicated. Otherwise, they tell you to hire another electrician.

Most thermostats allow you to adjust the on/off difference but not Nest. Same temperature swing when heating. You have to put on and then remove clothes to keep warm. Think twice before buying Nest. Trust me, I bought two!"}

I originally had purchased the EcoBee because I was interested in the room sensor function and its product ratings through trusted resources like CNET. After the EcoBee blew a fuse in my furnace because I was required to use the PEK tool (basically provides a C wire if you don't have one) I called a HVAC repair person. They followed the same installation instructions and blew 2 more fuses. I had installed it perfectly.\n\nI immediately returned the EcoBee and bought Nest and it works perfectly! I did not have to do anything strange to my furnace and I did extra research to confirm it is fully capable of recharging itself through your heating and cooling wires. I am very happy with the purchase as well as the application. It works great with my Alexa and there were not setup issues. This takes less than 15 minutes to setup. My only criticism is for folks looking for features in EcoBee - remember this is a learning thermostat. If you want to set your own schedule this application on Nest is a little clunky but that did not bother me at all since I like the learning feature."}

If I am gone for an extended time, I can kick the unit into eco mode and then a set a schedule to heat my house so it is warm when I get home.\n\nThe only problem that I have with this is that it is expensive. I have radiant heat with a thermostat in each room, so it isn't practical to have thermostats to control each room. Fortunately, I have dual fuel air conditioners that I can use for heating, so my plan is to use this to turn on forced air heat when I am returning from a long ski vacation. When I get back, I will have to manually turn on each of the hydronic radiant zones to get my home comfortable. (Radiant is the best heat. It is quiet--the fans wake me up--and it keeps the dust down. Also, the temperature curve is much more comfortable with the floors being warm and the air temperature gradually reducing as you get farther from the floor.)"}

I do have one complaint. Where it gets the weather for the display is off the Internet. We live in a pocket that can get much different 5-10 degrees than what the \"weather channel\" reports online. Not sure why they just don't get the temperature from the outside A/C-heat component, unless it doesn't know the temp outside, only inside. THE TEMP DISPLAY NEEDS TO BE FROM DIRECTLY OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, not from the \"Internet\" that some news agency is reporting. HOW INACCURATE! There must be a couple of dozen temperature sensors you can buy on the Internet that will allow you to install a sensor outside and get a more accurate temperature (unless it sits in the sun, or unusual spot). Sorry, but I'm all for accuracy. As far as the thermostat goes, it is a very nice product. I would buy more NEST products and may do so in the future. This was for an upstairs AC/heat unit. (Picture after install showing farsight setting called TARGET TEMP) Update: I am somewhat disappointed to find out that when setting a schedule on your day (ie. Monday, Tuesday, etc...) that your temperature changes have to be set 1 hour apart. I don't see why they can't be 15 minutes or 5 minutes apart.

First, the Nest and its self-programming was not beneficial. Every month or so I had to go and undo the programming that Nest made for itself because it was cooling at odd times. We NEVER saw a decrease in our bills and honestly, I believe the Nest increased our bills because of that. Finally, we have owned the Nest for 4 years. We called Nest support and they weren't able to help. We went through at least 4 different attempts to fix it. We then had to hire someone to come out and try to fix it. In the end and 250$ later, our Nest still doesn't work. The warranty expired after 3 years, which is utterly ridiculous on such an expensive thermostat. So, we paid around $500 for the Nest (initial purchase and the attempts to repair) for 4 years of use with no perceived savings. We are going back to our $40 programmable thermostat that will last us 10 years. Waste of money."}

Nest could fix all these problems but they don't.", "Text": "Every time I have to deal with this thermostat I'm frustrated. This thing has so much potential yet fails so horribly.\n\nPros:\nIt's pretty.\nNo wi-fi connection issues.\nIt hasn't broken, technically. (Has it ever worked, though?)\n\nCons:\nFirst and foremost, it doesn't hold a temperature, which I think is what a thermostat is supposed to do. I can't overstate how terribly uncomfortable this is. Temps swing 2 full degrees. I wake up at night sweating because it lets the temps rise so much before triggering the AC to come on. And then 30 mins later I'm freezing because it over cools. This, according to support, is to save my compressor from cycling too often. Okay, I get that, but this is all software, right? Give me the option to choose how much the temps swing. Why is this not user configurable?\n\nSecondly, so many of the features have no consideration from multi-stage systems. Instead, the settings want to swing temperatures wildly, which defeats the purpose of having a multi-stage system. Again, this is software--it COULD be smart enough to not trigger the second/third stage when it decides to swing, but of course it's not that smart. For example, the auto-away mode has a minimum setting of 76 degrees Fahrenheit. (I don't ever want my house 76 degrees in the summer, by the way--what's wrong with you, Nest?). If I leave, my house will go from 72 to 76. When I come back, it now wants to run the second stage AC to force the house down 4 degrees. Uhh... why isn't there some logic to say use first stage for an extended period instead? Again, this is software, right? Or how about you just let me have my away setting at 74, which is way more reasonable in the first place. If my thermostat were 76 degrees half the day it would be a sauna. It needs to cycle more than that just to control humidity where I live (KY). The heat used to have some stupid max setting of like 64 but they fixed that--it can now go up to 70. I'm not sure why they won't fix the AC. When I called support, the tech said he hears this complaint constantly.\n\nNext, the scheduling is awful. The auto-smart crap is like AI from 10 years ago. They must have gotten the code from RIM for the new BlackBerry. Manual scheduling is unbelievably time consuming. I'm forced to create a gazillion points to slowly bring the temp down because I don't want it to trigger the second stage AC. What I want, in the summer for example, is for my house to be 72 if I'm home during the day, 70 at night while I sleep, and 74 when I'm away (Boy, how I wish that auto-away feature wasn't so STUPID--it's the whole reason I bought this thing!)\n\nSo this thing can control a humidifier--great! Good luck finding that setting. I had to watch a YouTube video to figure out how to find it. Controlling the fan schedule is equally confusing. The humidifier setting is slightly easier to find on the phone app, but my HVAC tech doesn't have his phone setup to control MY thermostat. The fan setting is dumb in every interface.\n\nThis product is a piece of crap for no good reason.\n\nMy intention was to buy ALL of the Nest products, but if they can't get their core offering right, I have to assume that the rest of the line can't be worth my time."}

Then waiting over an hour for online chat tonight before I was finally \"helped.\" This is the worst thermostat I have ever used and maybe the worst company I have ever tried to get support from. Based on the wait time I'm clearly not the only person who has such major issues with your products.\n\nI have an E model Nest. The temperature is always 2 degrees off what I set it to. I set AC to 75 and it doesn\u2019t turn on until 77 degrees and stays on until 73. So I\u2019m always too cold or too hot and constantly adjusting the temp to fool it into turning on or off. I truly hate this thing! I know that\u2019s by design and cannot be changed unlike most other thermostats.\n\nI was hoping if I pay $250 for the gen 3 model that may be better than the Nest E, but your agent told me it's exactly the same temperature differential spec (despite a couple reviewers on Amazon saying it's a 1 degree differential each way for the gen 3). So disappointing. I cannot imagine how you think a temperature differential of 4 degrees that cannot be changed by the user is acceptable or comfortable.\n\nI will tell EVERYONE I know or anyone who will listen do not ever buy a Nest product. The ONE thing a thermostat needs to do is maintain a comfortable temperature. No matter how many useless bells and whistles you have or WiFi or Alexa integration, if you cannot maintain the temperature it's set to, your product is useless as its intended purpose. I'm heading to Amazon right now to post a review.\n\n______________\n\nI was really excited about trying out the Nest thermostat and really wanted to like this, but it's just horrible. My girlfriend comes over and is putting on and taking off a heavy jacket every 15 minutes based on what the AC is doing at the time. I am very picky about this sort of thing, but she is not, and the fact that she complains that my apartment is constantly too hot or too cold says a lot about this thermostat. It's nice otherwise... if it only worked."}

{"Author": "rgprints", "Date": "on May 3, 2018", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Compatibility issues are paramount. Tech support has some problems. Be aware before you buy!", "Text": "From my experience with the product, I can see why some might rate it 5 star, but my experience was not good and cost me a lot of time and frustration after purchasing and subsequently returning (one after another) three Nest Thermostats. It's a long story...\n\nMy heating-A/C system is three zone with a Honeywell HZ311 controller and an Amana ASXC16 air conditioner.\n\nThe saga begins in early January when I purchased and installed the first Nest Learning Thermostat after checking for compatibility online. Installation was a bit of a hassle because Nest thermostats won't work with the Honeywell controller unless there is a common wire. I had to overcome two problems - (1) the Honeywell thermostat that I was replacing had been incorrectly wired with respect to the common wire and Nest's instructions are based on existing wiring, and (2) the Nest tech support person that was helping me did not understand the common wire requirements as related to my controller. It took me a day or two of further detective work, greatly aided by inspecting the wiring on a second thermostat, to figure out how to properly wire the Nest.\n\nAfter several weeks of using the Nest with my heating system we ran into significant conflicts with the so-called \"learning\" aspects of the thermostat. I would set a schedule only to notice a few days later that my heating schedule had been inexplicably altered in ways that I could not understand. (A personal note. I have decades of experience in AI, starting in the early '70s as a graduate student, so I was also very interested in seeing how the learning function would work.) Well, the learning function of the Nest, IMHO, is beyond comprehension as it seems to completely ignore any explicit instructions it receives from the human operator, so I think Nest techies have a lot of work to do there. As a practical matter, we could not live with the thermostat as a learner. In a conversation (or chat) with tech support, the Nest representative suggested we replace the Learning model with the \"E\" model, which I then did.\n\nNow we were very happy with the Nest (the \"E\" model) for several months. We really liked the scheduling functions and the Eco \"away\" functionality, and what was particularly useful was the ability to remotely set the temperature prior to our return after a week-long absence.\n\nHowever, that happiness evaporated when we had a heat wave in early April with temperatures hitting 80 degrees and we found that the \"E\" was causing our air conditioner to rapidly cycle on and off with a significant loss in efficiency. What I had failed to notice and what the Nest rep had failed to point out is that the \"E\" and the \"Learning\" thermostats have differences wrto A/C compatibility. In particular, whereas the \"Learning\" works with two-stage air conditioners, the \"E\" does not. Our Amana is two-stage. All of this involved another long session with a Nest tech rep, and after going through our whole saga, the rep suggested we go back to the \"Learning\" model and also that it was easy then to turn off the learning feature which we strongly disliked. (I wish that the earlier rep had made that recommendation rather than the suggestion to replace with an \"E\"!)\n\nSo the \"E\" was returned and another \"Learning\" model obtained and installed. A few weeks went by and with the learning mode disabled we were now pleased with the the \"Learning\" model, until the weather got warm again. Then we saw that the \"Learning\" model induced exactly the same rapid cycling in the A/C as had been the problem with the \"E\". Again a conversation with tech support and this time the rep told me that my specific model of Amana was not compatible with any Nest thermostat. So now our third Nest has been returned, and we are getting a \"smart\" Honeywell thermostat instead.\n\nAfter all this I began to wonder if I had not been diligent enough in my initial compatibility checking, so I did a Google query combining \"nest\" with my Amana A/C model number, but got no hits. From that I conclude that the fact that my Amana is not compatible with Nest is knowledge available to Nest reps, but not the public.\n\nSome final comments on Nest tech support. If you've read this far, you are aware of several problems arising from tech support. Overall, support personnel were easy to work with and seemed very knowledgeable, even though in some cases it turns out that they should have been more knowledgeable. The biggest problem is that waits are extremely long, both for chat and for telephone support. On top of that, their chat and telephone technology is not reliable. I had at least two chat sessions that terminated unexpectedly, and one extremely frustrating phone call where I was finally connected to a tech after a 40 minute wait, only to immediately get disconnected. The phone wait is also extremely frustrating in that a voice occasionally comes on to inform you that wait times are extremely long and to suggest that it might be better to try at a different time, without suggesting a time range that might have shorter waits."}

One day I need the heat, next day, some AC, I don't want it to perform on history, cause my history and weather changes all the time. Sending it back for manual ones. If you wake up once on a Thursday at 3 am, think it's chilly, yiu turn the heat up, every Thursday it will automatically turn the heat up at 3 am.

If you like to adjust a thermostat 4-5 times a day ( open windows etc), do not get. Nothing but a nightmare. If you have a guest over, and they say it's chilly or warm in here on Tuesday, every Tuesday it will reset it self.in Colorado we have 30 -40 degree difference in a day.\n\nLet's say you go on vacation for a week, I just want to keep the temp at 60, set it, forget it ( heat), with no AC. \"Honey, did you turn it down, taxi is waiting, - yep all set\" Not happening, Can't do it, without erasing all history. The history includes every day, every hour that you changed the temp, so over a 10 day period, youmay have 80-90 settings in history. You have to delete each one individually.

You can set the temperature online or by voice command to Alexa.\n\nDisadvantages:. 1). Ridiculously expensive. 2) Does not show time like every dumb thermostat on Earth. 3).

Every dumb thermostat on Earth will wait a few minutes before calling for heat or cool so it doesn't thrash your motor. 5). You cannot control this thermostat remotely, you can only do a few things. You cannot, for example, just turn on the fan motor. 6). Doing anything manually on a Nest takes 5x as long as it would with any dumb thermostat on Earth. 7). The much-heralded learning ability meant for me that it learned the wrong thing. Guess how long it takes to get it to unlearn? Weeks. I set it to don't learn. Ever. 8). The face is blank unless you wave your hand in front of it, unlike every dumb thermostat on Earth. 9). Nest--like my wife--can't take a punch. I have punched it three times in utter frustration, and plastic pieces keep flying off. For this money Nest should give you a punch force value in foot-pounds or Newton-meters, configurable from Alexa.\n\nI was kidding about my wife.\n\nWith my next punch I will drop Nest like second-period French--and go back to a dumb thermostat."}

I am no expert but I will tell you my impressions if it is important to you to have it in both heat and cool mode. Dual mode works sort of but not like I wished, it doesn't seem to know that I wished it knew the outside temperature and would make the house a little warm or a little cold because of it. See to make it work it can't cross-over the temperatures. Not sure if this makes sense, so let me try to explain. I have to set the heat side to 68 and the cold to 71 and either the display will be orange if it is heating or blue if it is cooling. So the house is always a right around 70, but if it is cold outside I wished it would heat to 72 so it would be toasty inside, nope. Or if it is heating up outside I wished the cooling would come on sooner so that is doesn't heat up to 74 before the cooling can finally compensate and cools it down to 71. Maybe it will just get better and better as it learns, or I can switch to heat only and warm the house a little extra or to cool, but I could do that with my old thermostat, I just wanted to be lazy and never have to mess with it. To be perfectly honest that is happening now and I'm just living with how it works and to be frank, that is pretty good."}

Aside for my initial review below, this thing doesn't work half the time. I lived in this same house for over 5 years and the last 3 month have been terrible. Just trying to get this thing to kick on was terrible. I sweat more than ever and now that the Texas heat is kicking in I had to get rid of this piece of crap. Never had this issue with my stock unit. My place would consistently stay around 80 degrees and whenever I tried to get this thing to turn on the air it would just say it will be at my set temperature in 2 hours! I turned off all the 'features' trying to just get it to blow the AC and it would not work right. After looking around the net there seems to be an issue with this thing working because it share power and recharges from the standard wiring.\n\nI replaced this with my standard unit 3 days ago and everything has been great sense. DO NOT BUY THIS THING! Its way over priced, doesn't work properly and there are other options if you want a high-tech unit.\n\nEND UPDATE***\n\nA bit underwhelming for the price. I was pretty disappointed from opening the box when the first thing I seen was the base plate did not match the dial. I ordered the bronze one so it would look good on my wall but now it has this huge white plate under it and looks like crap.\n\nInstallation was pretty easy. I didn't shut off the power as it recommends (it doesn't damage the unit) but if you are not experienced with wiring make sure you do so you don't see sparks!\n\nOnce plugged in the setup was quick. I connected it to my WiFi and it updated right away. All was looking good then I got to the features. I don't know, maybe it's just me but spending several hundred for a unit that connects to WiFi and has an app the options are not much better than your standard plastic square unit. The indicator faces you see photos of on this page are pretty much all you get. Pretty generic and no customization.\n\nThe only cool thing about this is that it will sense when you walk by and you can have it display the Temp, Time (Digital or Analog but boring uncustomizable fonts) or the weather if you are connected to WiFi. You can't have it display multiple ones either. So if you want to have it show the time and temp when you walk by you're out of luck.\n\nSo overall, I wouldn't recommend spending so much money because you certainly are not getting that much out of it. The app is pretty much the same. It's only real purpose is if you want to change the temp from your couch. So I won't be using that at all."}

Everyone wants to know if Nest is as cool as it looks (it\u2019s probably even better than you expect). The super sleek design looks great on the wall without drawing needless attention to itself.\n\nNest\u2019s LED display conveniently lights up the dark hallway it sits in when you walk by at night. However, it\u2019s not so bright that I would hesitate to install it in a bedroom (it wouldn\u2019t wake you up). Having the ability to adjust the settings via the phone app or via a web portal is super slick. The fact that it has the ability to automatically switch between heat/cool modes is also very useful in spring/fall, when the weather requires heat in the mornings and AC by afternoon. It also tells you the inside humidity %, which is pretty awesome. Plus, it knows the local weather so it\u2019s always thinking. There are a number of energy saving features and reports you can utilize as well. One of my favorite features is the ability to synchronize it to your mobile phones. If you choose to set it up, it will adjust the HVAC setting depending if you\u2019re home or not. Yes, if you give it permission, it can detect if your families\u2019 mobile phones are present and adjust the air so you aren\u2019t wasting $. Seriously, how cool is that???\n\nMy big question was if the Nest would accept timer settings - or if you were forced to have it \u201clearn\u201d your preferences over time. My wife wasn\u2019t going to indulge my interest in having a smart thermostat if she was going to have to adjust the thermostat for the first few weeks. Fortunately, I was able to set up a schedule during the week and chose to let it \u201clearn\u201d our weekend routine (since I would be home to teach it on weekends). Truthfully, I haven\u2019t really messed with it more than a few times. My wife has little patience for technology when a less complicated/technological solution can perform the same task. Another nice feature I didn\u2019t know I cared about: Nest quickly \u201clearns\u201d your home and will tell you how long till your selected temperature is achieved.\n\nI do worry about what happens in 10 years if they decide they are no longer supporting this \u201colder\u201d technology via new phone/app updates, but I guess I\u2019ll worry about that 10 years from now (it will tell me if I am buying another Nest product when it\u2019s time to replace this one). The thermostat unit the Nest replaced was just a builder grade 6-day timer thermostat that fulfilled its purpose. No frills, but it worked pretty good.\n\nThe Nest tech is flawless and the online-installation tutorial is pretty much idiot proof. If you register it before you install it, it tells you where to connect the exact wires your wall has sticking out of it. It really couldn\u2019t have been easier. I get a bit nervous when I get into these kinds of home repairs, but it is something a novice can do (if you can change a wall switch/plug, this will be no problem). Highly recommend. If you are on the fence about whether to purchase a Nest, I hope my review was able to address some of your concerns."}

I had the Trane thermo removed and a Nest installed, the installation of the Nest took hours, the setup took hours too and it was done by a professional. After two weeks it had not learned any schedule but worked okay on the default 65 for heating and 77 for cooling. I programed in a schedule on the thermostat, which was painful, the Android app was better, but you had to start from scratch to make it easier. Well, it work fine for a few months but stopped using the two stage cooling capability I had, then I tried the combined heating and cooling mode but the two temperatures need to be more than 3 degrees F apart.\nwith less than six months usage of the Nest the thermostat went crazy, tried to cool the house to 68 when it was 90 outside and it was set to 77. then it started flashing no network connection. I could not change the temperature settings or mode at the thermostat or on the Android app or on the Microsoft Win-10 app, even when it was connected to my network.\nI call Nest tech support and got a woman who knew nothing, she knew less than nothing. she kept repeating instructions like; is it plugged in, what does the screen say, go to the app and tell me what mode it\u2019s in. I asked for someone that knew something, and she put me on hold and after 30 minutes I hung up but got an email from Nest tech person who said he tried to call but the line was busy, obviously a genius just out of kindergarten. I called back after removing the thermostat from the wall, the house was now close to 65, when I asked for a competent tech support person another Nest support person got on the phone, together we did some troubleshooting. we found that network ping time was 20,000 mS and kept disconnecting from my 5Gig wifi (which was working since I was watching a Yankee baseball game on my Roku), I tried connecting to the 2.4Gig and it would not link-up and the thermostat was still in locked in the cooling mode, but we did find the manual setting was working again and the separate cooling and heating modes did work again. in my poking around I found that the software had been updated the same day as when the thermostat went crazy.\nI have ordered another brand thermostat from Amazon to replace this Nest and I warn potential Nest buyers not to buy any Nest products, if they expect it work for more than 6-months."}

Such as its detection of whether someone is home or not. Unfortunately as reported on many websites including the Nest community website this home/away feature simply doesn\u2019t seem to work or at least it can\u2019t work when you have a schedule. For example if you want to set a schedule where the heater comes on automatically at 6 in the morning during the week and then shut off at 7:30 you can then no longer used to home away feature apparently. So if you decide to work from home that day even though the nest detects that I am home through the phone location, the heater will not go on. It has to be set manually. The auto learning feature did not learn anything either . The only thing that works is the set schedule that I entered. But if that is all this thing can do there are plenty of $50 thermostats which can do just as good a job.\n\nApparently there is a lot of frustration in the nest community about these issues but they are completely unable to address their software problems. Until those are fixed I would definitely recommend staying away from this thermostat."}

But in the middle of the night, set to air conditioning mode, it failed and displayed error code E108. I spent some time at Nest's website trying to solve the problem, but no luck. I waited ONE HOUR on the phone to reach tech support. The very nice technician walked me through a fix--removing one wire and replacing it. (The Nest support website did not spell out this solution, which it should have.) Then the Nest worked, but only for two hours. Now the same error message again.\n\nI called back, and was put on hold for 2 1/2 hours! To add insult to injury, the \"on-hold\" music must rank among the worst, most annoying, repetitive 20 seconds of audio. It would serve the Nest executive who chose this music right if he/she were tied down and forced to listen to this rot for 48 consecutive hours!\n\nWhen I finally reached a tech, he told me to remove the blue wire and not put it back. Finally, this fixed the problem. But why this could not have been spelled out on Nest's support website is beyond me. Turns out that earlier that day, Nest updated its software, and THAT is, I believe, what caused all these problems. An incompetent software update. And it was a failure on the part of Nest to not inform its tech support people that there had just been a software update that was causing problems.\n\nThe Nest thermostat is a very expensive product and after spending all that money, I expected it to work and work and work, just like my 7-year MacBook Pro computer does. My prior thermostat--a Honeywell--was still going strong after 20+ years, till I replaced it with a Nest. I am very disappointed that it failed.\n\nI am again on the phone, on a lengthy hold. What a terrible waste of time. I wish I could bill Nest for all the time--5 hours!--that their failed product is causing me to expand today. A big boo and thumbs down to Nest!"}

The videos offered on the Nest website made installation seem pretty easy, but mine wouldn't work right - no cold air from the AC. I went back through the instructions a number of times, looked online at user install videos - couldn't find anything that was helpful. Finally called Nest support. They answered straight away, and asked me a few questions, then asked me to upload the photo I'd taken of my wiring with the previous thermostat. I tried, but couldn't seem to get the image uploaded. While we were struggling with that, the technician asked me 'is your unit a heat pump?' When I replied 'yes', he said he thought he knew what the issue was. He had me attach a wire that wasn't covered in the install manuals, and it worked. I looked back through the instructions, and didn't find any documentation on how to connect the wires if you've got a heat pump. I'm sure that there's a LOT of homes out there with this type of AC unit, so perhaps there could be some clear documentation for that type of install put out there where it's more easily accessible.\n\nFor simple installations, the provided documentation is pretty easy, and you can install this unit yourself with a minimum of trouble. However, if you've a more complex setup - zoned ACs, for example, or a heat pump, it's a bit more complicated. Even with a simple install, there's a LOT of advanced settings that aren't clearly explained. Like primary and secondary heat settings. Heat pumps have both, but I couldn't tell you which is which, or if my Nest is wired to properly take advantage of that feature. Or a setting that asks me how long I want to 'preheat', with the default set to 5 hours. I've got no idea what that means, and haven't been able to find any Nest documentation that talks about that setting. I've a lot of questions to figure out if I'm using the best settings for a heat pump in North Florida, and so far not finding any helpful documentation.\n\nThat being said - it's working fine, and is saving me energy. By installing the app and tying it to my phone, the thing knows when I'm home and away, and goes into Eco mode when I'm away, which pretty much keeps it from running. Now that a few weeks have gone by, it has figured out my schedule, and starts to cool the house minutes before I get home. I looked at the schedule it created from my comings and goings, and I can see that it knows when I'm home, when I'm away, and knows when it's the weekend and that I'm home - the schedule it created on its own is a pretty clear indication the Nest knows when I'm around and when I'm not. It connected quickly and smoothly to my amazon echo device, but haven't used that feature a lot yet.\n\nI feel like I've gotten my money's worth from this device, and feel confident that I'll find the answers to my questions about the heat pump setup. It may already be set up correctly, but I want to know that I'm getting peak performance out of my AC, and I can't be certain I am at this point. I'll update this comment once I find that information."}

Well yes and no. I have found shady suppliers that will sell a battery on Amazon or Ebay. It requires you to disassemble the unit, replace the battery, and then reassemble it. It may not be a simple process for some users and it definitely will void your warranty.\n\nDead battery should not disable functionality. They should have used a standardized battery like triple AAA rechargable, and they should have put a simple door on the back to make it easy to replace the batteries.\n\nThis will likely end up in some people throwing away their thermostats to the landfill and replacing them.

I\u2019m one of those people for whom something seems to wrong or something is incompatible during every installation. So I ordered my Nest thermostat, and like everything else, I left it laying around for a few days while I procrastinated about installing it for fear of a difficult process. When I finally got around to opening the box, reading the instructions and then installing it, it was a snap. The installation instructions were clearly written and illustrated. Within a matter of minutes I had the thermostat installed and configured and I was downloading the app. The app is a pleasure to use, and even supports portrait mode on my iPad, something I don\u2019t take for ganged because a lot of the other home control apps don\u2019t ( basically you\u2019re using the iPhone version on the iPad with a lot of them).

Below are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Simple installation. I\u2019m fairly \u201chandy\u201d but it really is a piece of cake. However I could see where the installation of any thermostat could be confusing to someone not as hands-on. That said I\u2019ve probably installed 5-8 thermostats over the years and this one was as easy as any.\n- Looks pretty. I had to use the included wall plate as our last one was rectangular shaped.\n- Fairly idiot-proof to control.\n- Easy to hook into your wi-fi. WiFi extremely convenient feature, especially since our thermostat is downstairs and bedrooms are up.\n\nCons\n- On my old $50 Honeywell thermostat, when I set it to 72 degrees then that\u2019s when the unit cut on or off. In other words, once it hit the desired temp, it cut off. The Nest does not. Literally nine times out of ten when I walk by the Nest, though I have it set to 72, the temperature will show as 73 and the Nest will still be blowing heat. It\u2019s really quite baffling. It has done this since day one. I almost returned the unit solely because of this, and would have if I hadn\u2019t gotten rid of the old one. I also said to myself, in those early stages, that there\u2019s probably something that I don\u2019t understand and it\u2019s just doing it\u2019s \u201clearning\u201d thing, or whatever. Nope, that\u2019s just the way it works.\n- Ah yes, the Nest \u201clearning\u201d. The weather here in Houston is quite variable, especially during Fall through Spring. We can literally have 40-50 degree swings, back and forth, in the matter of a couple days. This completely befuddled the Nest unit. To the point where I just turned all the \u201clearning\u201d off because, well it wasn\u2019t.\n- location-based learning. Can\u2019t comment much on this one as I thought it was gimmicky, and I don\u2019t need Nest to \u201clearn\u201d my location, and then do whatever it does with that personal data. But I do realize that I\u2019m increasing in the minority of people who care about sharing such personal data with sources\n- will sometimes randomly drop WiFi. Tr first couple of times it did this I just assumed it was my WiFi, but since then I\u2019ve checked other systems (iMac, phone, etc) and it was only the Nest that lost connection. Doesn\u2019t happen a lot, but just a small quirk.\n\nIn summary, I\u2019m about to replace the thermostat of a second unit we have in the house, and I will NOT be purchasing another Nest. It\u2019s not a \u201cbad\u201d device, but just extremely overrated for the price. If it was in the $100-150 range I\u2019d probably just get another one, since I already have one, but after better research this time (as opposed to just listening to a couple of dear millennial friends rave about theirs over dinner) I\u2019ve found a competing unit from Emerson for $130. I plan to buy two of these and get rid of the Nest. Look for it on EBay soon!\n\nPeace and blessings."}

{"Author": "Jayne Richardson", "Date": "on April 6, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "it looks far better than the competition", "Text": "This thermostat is highly overrated. While, admittedly, it looks far better than the competition. However, that is it. I purchased it because of 1) it's \"learning\" capabilities and, primarily, 2) the Home/Away feature. This feature claims to use the account owner's and any associated household member's cell data, wifi connectons, and gps to determine when they are home and when the house is empty. There are also motion sensors for household members not on the account or who don't have a smartphone phone. In theory, the thermostat will automatically go into eco mode when no one is home and return to regular mode when a person returns. Resulting in energy savings.\n\nFirst impressions were fine; it learned what temp I wanted in a.m. and overnight. Great. Problem was, for instance, any temporary adjustments made during the day (e.g., little chilly today, let's turn up the heat) were soon done every day at that time. I found I had to go into the \"learned\" schedule and make the necessary changes. Which means, in effect, I was manually creating a schedule as you would with any programmable WiFi thermostat costing half the price.\n\nIn addition, the Home/Away feature is bugging and only works sporadically at best. On most days it seems to pay no attention to the location of associated phones, and remains in home mode when no one is there, or, if by chance it properly goes into away mode,it will stay in that mode long after people return. Another great characteristic is that it will key on one phone as if it is the only phone that matters. This means cold house when people are home or heating an empty house. Of course you can manually set the mode to home or away, but, again, this defeats the purpose of buying this expensive devices versus a more affordable programmable unit.\n\nAs usual, the company's support and forum pages just have scripted responses outlining how to troubleshoot this well documented issue. At the end of the day, you are better off saving $100 and getting a Honeywell programmable WiFi unit. At least until a 4th or 5th gen Nest fixes these issues."}

This includes ordering, shipping, installation, and support. It's clear Google does not understand selling to consumers and has not invested properly. I've been technically selling enterprise database and related software for the past 25 years so have a bit of experience in these technologies. I provide this feedback on the Amazon site so others are aware. I frequently buy on Amazon and am a prime member. I wanted to buy the Nest Thermostat E. It's not available on Amazon so I tried to buy it on Nest's site. I created an account only to learn the Nest store account doesn't have a relationship to a \"Nest Account\" which apparently is for devices. At checkout the Nest store had no knowledge that was I logged in as a \"Nest Account\". Ironically I was logged in to the Chrome browser with my google credentials. Neither Nest or their store understood the Google login. I order the Nest Thermostat E and a remote sensor which apparently is available in late April 2018. I select 2 day shipping. I place the order and nothing happens; no web page change or email. I have no idea if the oder occurred. About 30 min later I get an email to my gmail account with the order # and everything will ship when the remote sensor is available (date not specified). The Nest Thermostat E is available now. I call Nest support many times (incredibly frustrating due to their complete inexperience) and basically learn that Nest ships only once per order and only ships when all order components are available. I explain this is the exact opposite of Amazon the industry standard. Amazon ships oder components as these are available. I cancel the order (have to call, can't do it from the web site) and buy the Thermostat E at Best Buy. I prep the walls (paint and fill holes) so it's a clean, minimal appearance. The Nest E wiring is simple as is the wall mounting. When I turn the HVAC power back on the AC begins running very cold. I follow the Nest installation instructions including scanning the device QR code with my iPhone X. I thus assume the nest app (logged in with my gmail) knows about this Nest thermostat. I then press the Nest dial to configure. The device indicates battery low, unable to proceed and is shutting down. The AC continues to run and the house is freezing. I try to configure the device from the iphone app. It knows nothing about the device even though I scanned the QR code. I call Nest support and they have no clue what to do. I keep reminding them the AC has been running nonstop with no way to shut it off short of turning off the circuit. They finally asked me to shut down the AC via the circuit breaker. I told them I'm returning the device to Best Buy. The worst part of all this is the appalling lack of Nest customer support skills. I've been supporting customers for my software products for 25 years. It's as if the Nest product support people are deliberately trying to violate every possible standard of proper customer interaction. Google's support on the Nest product is the worst. I'll never buy another Google consumer product."}

However, I did have a couple of issues. Firstly, upon opening the Amazon box, I noticed that the Nest packaging had no cellophane and the seal had actually been broken. When I opened the Nest box some of the included screws where in the wrong location. So I knew that, at the very least, the package had been opened before. Everything was there though and nothing looked damaged. Next was the install. I followed the instructions and got the thermostat installed on the wall and ran through the initial setup. Here is where I ran into issue 2. When I did the test for A/C my heater actually came on and when I tested my heater only the fan would come on. After doing some Google searching, I found out that the white wire that would normally go to the W1 terminal, actually goes to the OB terminal (this would normally be an orange wire) if coming from certain Honeywell thermostats (which I was). Once I moved the white wire from W1 to OB the system works exactly as intended. Took off one star for receipt of an unsealed unit. I will update my review if I have any other issues. So far so good though."}

And when it does stop, trying to get it back on the job has been a chore taking hours of resetting and rebooting the unit, and turning my furnace off and on countless times. Then, it will magically begin working again.\n\nI have called Nest only for them to tell me that my 1 year old, high-end furnace is the problem. I have updated the software just in case I was the victim of the glitch they had with the power on one of their releases. I never did have a problem with the battery going dead. It always indicated that the heat was on, only that it would be another 2 or more hours before it reached the temperature in my schedule. It would continue to say that all day if you didn't address it. Meanwhile the temperature in the house continued to drop.\n\nI finally gave up trying and bought a Honeywell WiFi thermostat. Guess what, my furnace is not the problem after all! The Honeywell is so much easier to set up and gives so much more information on the display. No more spinning the dial forever trying to enter a network password. The Honeywell actually has a keyboard that pops up when typing it!

Now I've missed the return window and I'm stuck with an expensive thermostat that doesn't function properly. This seems to be a very common issue if you do an internet search so if you absolutely have to have one I'd purchase it from a seller that has a longer return window. Now I have to see if I can get Nest to replace it themselves. Buyer beware!"}

This gadget failed, and they will not take responsibility. We have been in contact with them for over a year, after submitting all of our paperwork and the faulty product.

This setup has been working flawlessly for a few years now but the other day I came home to find a very cold home and that my outdoor A/C compressor was running non-stop. The Nest itself was reporting that the room was at least 10 degrees warmer than it really was, and overheating. After troubleshooting with Nest support we determined that my Y1 terminal was faulty and causing whatever connected to it to be constantly cycled. All that Nest support offered was a discount on buying a new model thermostat. My outdoor compressor likely ran for hours in below freezing temperatures. I'm hopeful the Nest didn't cause any major issues but it hasn't been warm enough for me to have it properly tested. I live in a multi-family building and I'm just grateful the Nest didn't cause a fire by overheating.\n\nWhen I bought the Nest I expected to get much more life out of it than I have and it seems ridiculous and very wasteful to have to buy a completely new thermostat for one faulty part."}

Also, it's disappointing that the energy usage history only goes back 2 weeks, and there is no way to view energy usage beyond that time frame. Nest will send a \"monthly home report\", but it doesn't show how much energy was used each day or the outside temps, etc. It would be super awesome if there was a way to access this information! Anyway, we have reduced our energy bills, which is nice, but we ended up programming our Nest to a regular schedule because for some reason it always wanted to go to 67 degrees (like that was the default temp or something).

I assume it was just old age. So I decided to give my thermostat an upgrade.\n\nSearching around I kept coming across a nest thermostat. I was skeptical at first because of the ridiculous price but I couldn't find any competing device that offered everything this did. So I broke down and bought one.\n\nBoy am I glad I did. This thing is so handy.\nBetween the ability to set a temp schedule, the home away assist and the ability to manually set temp from your phone I have reduced my bill by 40%. And the first month I installed it and saw the 40% reduction, it was on the coldest month of the year (Feb). That is nuts! By my calculations this thing will pay for it self by end of spring.\n\nHowever I still think this device is way over priced. Let's be real here, it's a thermostat with a few bells and whistles. It's not a smart phone or a rumba. If I could do it over I think I would try to get a used one instead.\n\nAs far as installation goes, it's pretty simple. Just follow the instructions.\nFirst shut down power, then pull the current thermostat out (with wires attached), label the wires with what ports they connect to, take out the current thermostat, add nest mount, wire in nest using the labels as a guide, turn power back on.

The Nest has a learning mode where it monitors when and how you adjust the temperature to build a custom schedule. Alternatively, you can manually create your own schedule manually.\n\nCons: The thermostat is very sensitive to protruding wires interfering with the operation of the push button function (pressing in on the thermostat). This is really not a big deal as it's easy to push the wires into the wall to avoid interference but there should have been a warning in the documentation. If there was, I missed it. The manual programming is a bit of a pain with a less than ideal method of creating entries one day and time period at a time. It would be so much more efficient if you could select multiple days simultaneously and/or drag an item to extend it to other days. The last item I'm disappointed with is the Nest has no capability to back up your settings. I spent a great deal of time creating the configuration, some with the help of Pro Support. If for whatever reason, the unit lost the settings, I would have to start over from scratch. I'm disappointed that the iPhone (and Android) app doesn't allow me to save the settings to a configuration file that I could use to restore settings if ever necessary.\n\nNest customer support: Outstanding support, some of the best I've ever had with any company. I have a somewhat complicated system, a heat pump with auxiliary heat and a high efficiency gas furnace which I use as my primary heat source, with 8 wires going to the thermostat. They call this a dual fuel system. I visited Nest's website before my purchase to check compatibility. The compatibility guide recommended I call them to confirm compatibility (they recommend this for all dual fuel systems for good reason). The agent I spoke to was very friendly and knowledgeable, confirmed compatibility, and even emailed me a wiring guide for my specific system. After purchasing and receiving the thermostat, I called the \"Pro\" group (free of charge) with additional questions. They were experts, extremely knowledgeable, verified the wiring for my system and guided me through initial setup and configuration to use my gas furnace as primary heat source with the ability to quickly switch it to heat pump if I should ever desire. I was extremely impressed with my support experience."}

Read the whole post to see how you can get it for almost free like I did!", "Text": "I love having this! I never saw all the hype before, but with the black Friday sales, decided to just do it.\n\nI am so glad I did!\n\nI love that it knows when we are not home, and will adjust acordingly. I can even set up how I want it to react when I leave. How low is too low in the winter, and how hot is too hot in the summer. (we have a pet, so I like that I can let it get a little colder or warmer, but not so cold that our sweet kitten is uncomfortable)\n\nIt syncs to your phone, so when your phone is more than a couple of miles away for more than an hour or so, it adjusts to the energy saving mode. As soon as your phone pops into that radius - it kicks on to get the house back to where you want it to be. It also has a motion sensor, so if my phone is gone, but the kids are home, it knows to not kick into energy saving mode.\n\nI love the fact I can control it from my phone period! One night we got stuck in a snow storm, and it was down in low energy mode. We had to stay the night elsewhere, so I bumped the heat up a notch or two for our kitten to stay warm. (she is spoiled I guess)\n\nIt can read the weather forecast, so if its colder or warmer than usual, it can adjust accordingly. It gives me a monthly update too on how I did on energy, and how I compared to those around me.\n\nIt gives us helpful hints on how to run the fan system - without actually running the AC or furnace. This rotates the already warm/cool air without using more energy from those. It can kick the fan on manually or I can set it up to do it automatically. Things I never thought of!\n\nI got it in the winter, so I have not had a lot of time to experience the summer months of AC, but I have noticed looking at the readings on my energy bills that the usage has gone down. It helps me be more mindful, and give me tips to save. Just the fact that it knows when we are gone and can turn down, is amazing. No one sets their furnace schedule when they are leaving for a few hours or a quick weekend get away - they leave it alone or turn it off which can cost more in the long run to warm a freezing house back up! This allows us to do that - with no fuss!\n\nIf you are looking to get - check with your local power and gas company first for rebates. I did this, and got $100 from my power company and $50 from my gas company. I only paid $170 on black Friday - so this thing literally cost me $20. I have easily saved that much in my lowered usage bills.\n\nInstall was a breeze. My husband had it done in about 10 minutes. He watched a youtube video on it for good measure, but I think he already knew just from the directions what to do. He even said \"it cant be this easy - I must be missing something\" so that's why he watched the video. And it was right, it was so easy! You match color wire to color slot. Done."}
{"Author": "Andy Slye", "Date": "on March 15, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Simple setup + anywhere control + energy savings", "Text": " After tons of research, I found that the Nest Learning Thermostat was by far the most popular choice as the best smart thermostat. The main reason I wanted a smart thermostat was to save money on my electric bill because not only is it auto-programmable but it\u2019s controllable from anywhere using your smartphone.\n\nIn the box there is the Nest learning thermostat itself, the installation and welcome guides, a Nest screwdriver with screws, and a trim kit.\nEven though this thermostat works with most 24V systems you should first visit the Nest compatibility checker to see if it\u2019s compatible with your home before purchasing. The installation is actually pretty simple. Watch the video for a quick overview of how to install it.\n\nAfter setup is complete, you can press down on the display to bring up the menu. From here you can change the mode from heating to cooling, view how much energy you\u2019ve used in the last ten days, view or change the schedule, set it to Away if you\u2019re leaving the house and want to save energy, and adjust some basic settings.\n\nThe Nest home screen turns blue when cooling and orange when heating. It not only shows you what temperature the thermostat is set to but it also shows you the current temperature inside and will give you an estimate of how long it will take for the current temperature to reach your set temperature. It also has a motion sensor built into it so when you walk by the thermostat it will light up so you can quickly see the thermostat temperature, and you can also choose to change the setting for it to show the weather or time.\n\nOne of its most compelling features is the way it \u201clearns\u201d your heating/cooling habits. After a few days, it will set an automatic schedule based on how/when you adjust the temperature. This is useful if your weekly routine doesn\u2019t change much because with the auto schedule you seemingly don\u2019t need to adjust the thermostat each time you leave and come home. However, if your routine is very different week to week then the auto schedule won\u2019t be as helpful. Luckily you can customize the schedule to however you want it or turn off the schedule completely.\nTo take full advantage the features you\u2019ll want to download the free Nest smartphone app. It does require an account but the account is completely free to set up.\n\nFrom the app you can manually change from Home to Away mode. However, the Nest Thermostat uses sensors, algorithms, and even your phones location if you choose to allow that, to automatically determine when you\u2019re home and when you\u2019re away to set the thermostat accordingly so you can save as much energy as possible which is nice. If you tap on the temperature in the app, you can quickly adjust the thermostat temperature and you also get access to the same settings that are accessible from the thermostat itself: Mode, Eco, Fan, Schedule, and History. There\u2019s also a gear icon in the top right which gives you even more customization options for your thermostat.\n\nEco temperatures are automatic temperatures that are set when your thermostat is in Away mode and it\u2019s indicated by the green leaf. The default Eco temperatures are good for most people. However if you have a pet you may want to customize the Eco temperatures based on your pet\u2019s needs. What\u2019s neat about scheduling is you can turn on the Early-On feature which will start the heating or cooling early in order to reach the set temperature at the time specified in your schedule, instead of having it start the heating or cooling at that set time. You can also create a 4-digit PIN to lock your thermostat to avoid people changing it without the code which may be useful in certain situations.\n\nOverall I\u2019m extremely happy with my Nest Learning Thermostat. It\u2019s only been a few weeks but I\u2019ve already seen the energy saving benefits from having a smart thermostat which was my main goal. I also love the ability to control the thermostat from anywhere with my smartphone."}

It is a programmable thermostat with loads of extra features that don't work. I ordered a White Nest thermostat and received a stainless steel Nest thermostat. Installation was extremely simple. I had it up and running in under 30 minutes from box to completely installed. Even setting it up and signing in to the internet was easy and explained well. The user interface is well done and easy to use, still, there are areas that don,t work... For instance, setting up the display to show you weather instead of the current room temperature will work for around 20-30 minutes and then reset to temperature again. There is no way to make this stay permanently set to weather. It will ALWAYS default back to current room temperature. Next, we started using the Nest's learning abilities so it would learn and automatically adjust the temperatures. This worked and it started automatically changing the temperature just like the much cheaper programmable thermostats do. However, there is only one setting. My cheaper programmable thermostat had three settings I could program into it and save. One for winter, one for summer, and one for vacations or anything else I wanted. This has one setting only. Due to our need to change the temperature temporarily on occasion we downloaded the Nest app and set it up to automatically track our family member locations so it could adjust the temperature automatically based upon our location. This feature only works for a few hours and then it adjusts back to the programmed, or learned, temperatures. You can reset and start over again but it always quits working. The same result when using the \"Leaf\" setting. It will automatically reset to normal and turn the energy saving mode off, always completely by itself.\nThen you receive the monthly statement in your email that explains your energy use and provides recommendations to save money. In the winter I keep my low temperature at 65 and high at 68. The recommendations from Nest are to drop my low temperature to 60. So, if you have ever analyzed your energy cost and use, as I have done, you would know that this is more costly. Raising the entire house from 60 to 68 costs me more electricity, and therefore more money, than simply maintaining my low temperature of 65. This lets conclude that the Nest recommendations are not specifically tailored to markets or prices. They are simply copy and paste recommendations from Nest.\nSave yourself the time, effort, and money with a programmable thermostat that does the same things for much less money. If they drop the price of the Nest thermostat to around $100 it would be worth it. Until then it is a waste of money. You can save money with many other programmable thermostats that more options and features than the Nest. I replaced my programmable thermostat with the Nest and my energy costs have gone up a very slight amount. Not enough to worry about, but it doesnt justify the cost of the Nest. I wasted my money."}

I don't quite understand the mindset of its developers but it seems that they intended this for use by extremely rich white house wives with a/c and heat control in every room of their mansion. Most normal people have just one thermostat in their house, even if it's got 3 bedrooms and 4 stories. I don't think I've ever been in a house with more than one thermostat. There's not even an option to choose \"House\" as the location of the thermostat. This makes no sense. On top of all this their Alexa app is probably one of the worst device control apps I've ever had the displeasure of using. It has almost zero instructions on what the commands are, you basically have to guess, and the commands are limited, make no sense, and once again, assume that you have a thermostat in every freaking room. Who are these people? \"Alexa set the basement to 68\" Yeah, setting \"the basement\" to 69 isn't possible because that would set the whole house to 69, I named it \"The House\" instead, since it didn't have that as option I had to do it custom. Not only that, if the heat is on and I want it to cool instead, I have to say \"Alexa, set 'The House' to cool\" THEN say \"Alexa, set The House to 69\". Only then will she turn the A/C on and cool it down. Why can't I just say set the house to 69 and have it assume that if the heat is on, and it's 76, that she should turn the A/C on instead and cool it down to 69? WTF?"}

It feels like they have completely lost touch with their customers.\n\nI want the thermostat to auto-learn my schedule - 3/5\nNest will auto-learn your schedule, but if you want to edit your schedule it lacks any usability conveniences of its competitors. There's no concept of \"this is the temperature I sleep at\" to adjust in one place and apply to all days. There's no way to set up a single day's schedule and copy the others from it. Every adjustment must be manually set for each day, for each time, to the exact temperature you want for heat and cool. Letting it auto-learn adjustments means a couple weeks of manually adjusting temperatures on the device every day. Spending 5 minutes tweaking a schedule seems easier than spending a couple weeks being slightly uncomfortable or manually adjusting the thermostat all the time, but Nest's bad interface means even this manual approach is more of a hassle than it needs to be.\n\nI want the thermostat to automatically save energy while I'm out - 1/5\nNest does a great job of automatically going to \"eco\" mode when you're out. But if you set your eco heating temp to 60 for example, prepare to come home to a 60 degree house every day and wait an hour or two for your house to warm up. Nest has a concept of \"Early On\" to pre-heat or pre-cool your home, but Auto-Away overrides this, so you have to choose between disabling Auto-Away entirely (then why did I buy a $250 thermostat?), or coming home to a too-hot or too-cold house every day and waiting 1-2 hours for your house to reach a comfortable temperature. Again, it makes me think, \"Maybe I should just spend 30 minutes once, programming a schedule in a normal thermostat to save energy in my normal work hours and come home to a comfortable house.\" Note: you can manually disable eco mode to preheat your house every day, but if you don't disable the entire Auto-Away feature, then your house is likely to go back to eco mode on its own before reaching any sort of comfortable temperature.\n\nI want to manually tell the thermostat to save energy when I'm on vacation - 1/5\nRecently, Nest calls this mode \"off\" for some reason. \"Off\" mode still runs heating and cooling to maintain a minimum and/or maximum temperature, to prevent damage to your house. However, these safety temperatures are restricted to 35-45 and 95-105. There's literally no way for me to tell Nest to maintain 55 degrees while I'm on vacation, short of resetting to factory settings.\n\nI want the thermostat to measure the temperature in a location other than where the thermostat is located - 1/5\nThis may not apply to most people, but my thermostat hookup is located in an inconvenient location. Heating vents pipe in to the bedrooms, so it's most efficient to close the bedrooms to trap in heat, but the thermostat is located in the hallway, so would be left out in the cold. Even leaving the bedrooms open, I can still expect the bedrooms to reach 7-10 degrees warmer than the thermostat location, resulting in 7-10 degree temperature swings in the bedroom throughout the night, which can be quite uncomfortable. Users have been asking for temperature sensors for years, and Nest refuses, claiming there is no need because the device is \"intelligent\" and learns your home's \"thermal dynamics\". However, the bottom line is Nest has no way to address this kind of issue, while some of their competitors do."}

Cheers\n\nI was very excited to replace my very old Honeywell thermostat; even though it worked fine it was severely outdated. I spent an entire day troubleshooting this Nest with them on the phone; very very frustrating. My system is a heat pump with 4 wires going to the thermostat. Eventually support realized that \"my system was not compatible with Nest\". What I'm actually reading though is that Nest is a bit of a power vampire and it sucks power off of your existing system (assuming there is not a common wire ran for it). This power leeching can cause anomalies to happen to your HVAC system and for it to not function properly. In my case, the heat pump would short cycle; running for only 30 seconds or so and then shut off; even though the internal air handler would still be pushing air throughout the house. Very frustrating that it took support this long and it came out inconclusive. I would NOT recommend a Nest unless you have a common wire; with it's own power to power this thing. Even though it has it's own lithium ion battery; it's apparently not enough to power the thing without interfering with the rest of the system."}

Well you can but it will change to the schedule at the next scheduled time. Worse it may learn that new temp change if you do it often and put it in your schedule.

Which is wasn't, I live in a small house.\n\nI was unable to take the time to diagnose, but I did try a few things I read on the Nest support website such as resetting the device completely. I had recently gotten a new internet service so I thought the new modem was incompatible with the Nest. I was currently married to my job so I didn't have the time or energy to dig in further, and I'm an introvert so I didn't like the idea of calling support (when I was sure it was just my modem).\n\nToday I got a new internet service and the service went back to our old router and modem, so I was really excited - our Nest would connect to the internet again! No such luck. So I called Nest Support and they said they're having many of these come back because the wifi chip (network chip, whatever it's called) goes bad. And they couldn't do anything for me because I'm 5 months out of the 2-year warranty.\n\nVery frustrating since it is a product defect and it's been defective for over a year. On their side, they could see the last time it had been connected to the internet, so it was obvious I wasn't making this up. The tech support person I talked to said they felt I should get a replacement but then the higher-ups said, sorry no! And I'm now kicking myself that I didn't call a year ago... Very frustrating! Not to mention I had to convince my husband to let me get this (I love new technology, he's more apprehensive), and then this happens. Guess he wins this one.\n\nIt's basically a regular thermostat now. No networking abilities and I can only use it manually. Have I mentioned this is very frustrating? It is frustrating."}

It fails do two of the main things nest claims to do:\n\n1. It doesn't help us be as efficient as possible. It can't detect our source as a heat pump (a brand new Mitsubishi P-Series), therefore, we can't put it into \"heat pump mode\", which would have directed it to run on low as much as possible. Instead, it just turns on / off / on / off all day like an old fashioned boiler would. That's not a very efficient way to run a heat pump. Also, it sometimes kicks in to \"stage 2\" heat when I turn it up only one degree. There is no way to manually tell it to stay in Stage 1. Again, inefficient and bad for energy.\n\n2. \"Home/Away Assist\" does not work for us at all. It takes hours to sense we're gone - which I know is on purpose (in case you run to the neighbors house real quick), but I think that's dumb. If I want to choose to make it turn down as soon as we leave our property, I should get to have that choice. That feature could be handled with geofencing, which they don't use. Instead, we have to put it into away mode manually, and EVEN THEN, it somehow it switches back into \"home\" -- even if we're miles away. We don't have pets or anything else that might trigger the motion sensor (we tested it by putting a towel over it to blind the sensor). We finally gave up and started just turning it down manually when we leave for the day. Inconvenient.\n\nFor both of these issues, I was on the phone with customer service for HOURS. They even escalated me to a higher level of tech support, but still could not help me. I commend them for being so helpful (and so easy to get a hold of). but at the end of the day, they could not solve my issues and I'm annoyed.\n\nThere are other features that make this handy. I like controlling it over wifi, especially when we're not home. It'll tell us when to change the filter based on how much the heater actually ran. It's also pretty and I'm a total design snob. I just don't think that's worth the big price tag."}

The online Nest guide to determine compatibility with my existing Honeywell thermostat was particularly helpful, with a 3-minute video, that shows you how to determine if the Nest should work. I listed the 5 wires that i saw on my existing thermostat, and then was told that the Nest was compatible. My primary aim in replacing the Honeywell was to have something tied in to my WiFi, that i could monitor remotely, and receive a warning if the temperature of the house had fallen (we live in New England, and got particularly nervous this winter when the temperature plunged in late December, while we were away). I bought the Nest, and as advertised, it was very easy to install, and it worked, and still works well. It also has a slick, clean design, and the online app is easy to use, so i was a happy customer. Until last weekend (it has been working for about 3 weeks now), when i saw another dad that had installed one, and said that he had a problem with his Nest, associated with the amount of power it was drawing. This feedback made me nervous. Then i was in my basement, and i heard what sounded like short circuit sounds at my boiler. There is an electrical box that was clicking, sending signals to the boiler, and the boiler itself was then clicking, and not turning on. I thought that the heat might be off completely, as one of the zones seemed to be calling for heat, and the boiler seemed unable to turn on. Eventually it did turn on, but i could tell that something in the wiring was wrong. We called a contractor over, and it turns out the Nest needs a common wire, I think because the Nest draws a lot of power? I don\u2019t totally understand the issue with the Nest, but after a $300 repair bill, and the addition of a sixth wire, a common wire, the Nest seems like it should work now. However, the online compatibility guide absolutely did not say anything about needing a sixth wire! I think this is wildly false advertising, and with Nest owned by Google, i would expect more/better. I had placed an order for a second Nest, which i just cancelled. Evidently there is a Honeywell model, RTH9580, which ties into Wifi, and can be monitored online, without this power issue. I\u2019m so disappointed, and hope that other people don\u2019t make the same mistake that i made."}

Basically, the correction was to a move wire from the W1 to W2 Auxiliary.\n\nCAVEAT: TAKE A PHOTO of your ORIGINAL thermostat wiring!! You wil be glad that you did.\n\n2) NEST seems very proud of the fact that it does not need/use jumpers. This is true if your jumper is bridging R to Rh. However, the \"no jumper\" feature does not include any other jumper settings. In our case we had a jumper bridging W2 to E (Emergency Heat) - see attached photo. Result? We no longer have the Manual Emergency Heat option. While this is disappointing, we could not think of a time when we ever used Manual Emergency Heat. Manual Emergency Heat is not Auxiliary Heat (heat strips). From what we have learned Manual Emergency Heat is a feature most useful in the higher latitudes. We live at the beach in North Carolina so it is not an issue for us.\n\nWe called NEST support concerning this issue. They researched possible solutions.

It was my first experience with a \"smart\" thermostat and it worked...pretty well. It changed temps over wifi just fine...the auto away mode was nice but also could be a pain. It is not very configurable so if you like to have your ECO temp low you are going to arrive to a VERY cold house with no configuration options.\n\nI worked around some of these options by using stringify and IFTTT and that helped quite a bit.\n\nThe big problem came when I found that my furnace was throwing an error code 11. Basically what would happen is the inducer motor turned on, the HSI came on but then as soon as the gas valve was opened the system shut down and started over. This would only occur on occasion but was sometimes so bad that it would cause the system to cycle 5 times and lockout.\n\nI troubleshot this problem buying replacement parts and when I couldn't figure it out had a tech visit three times. The conclusion? The Nest wasn't holding the call for heat always past the opening of the gas valve. The tech controlled the heat call bypassing the thermostat to verify this. Because I liked the product overall and didn't want to change products on the wall I bought another one. Same problem.\n\nObviously not everyone has this issue. I have a newer furnace (95% efficient Lennox) and maybe it's just an issue with this particular model. However, what I do know is that I've tried four thermostats and only ONE has had an issue. That is the Nest.\n\nFor a premium product it sure doesn't do the most basic thing. Because no errors were reported on the Nest I'm out $400 in repair bills to diagnose this problem to the thermostat.\n\nPersonally...if you want a smart thermostat get an Ecobee. It has many more configuration options that really create a much smarter experience. Plus it actually works.\n\nWhen I called Nest they had the audacity to claim that if I would have called them first they could have fixed the issue. Two Nests didn't fix the issue...three HVAC techs didn't fix the issue...replacing the NEST FIXED THE ISSUE. They are denying me any coverage of my service claims because when my house was cold because the heat didn't turn on I didn't call Nest first and instead called a furnace company.\n\nI have never been so disgusted with a product."}

I have tried all the troubleshooting steps on Nest's website, tried contacting customer support all to no avail. I have a new router now (mind you the original router worked fine with it for months), and still no luck no connection, no support, no thermostat.

We were very excited to be able to control our thermostat from our phones and use the learning technology to automatically adjust the temp in our home.\n\nFrom the first moment we put in on the wall, we had a horrible experience. Its attempts at being easy to use actually introduce a lot of frustration. For example, you use the ring around the end to scroll to various options and enter letters/numbers for configuration. It tries to be 'smart' and enter the number you stop on even though you haven't pushed the button to select it, which is unexpected and results in you entering letters twice. However, it doesn't do it every time, about half the time, which makes it even more confusing. To make matters worse for us, it restarted 4 times while we were trying to enter the setup information, and lost ALL the information we had so painstakingly entered every time.\n\nOnce we got it configured, we thought we were set. However, once the nest turned our furnace on, it didn't turn it back off again. It kept the furnace running for hours until our house was 7 degrees warmer than we had set it on the thermostat. Even turning it off didn't work. We had to physically remove it from the wall before the furnace would shut off. This happened 4 times.\n\nWe tried everything because we really wanted it to work, but in the end had to come to terms with the fact that the nest is in fact, a POS. Don't waste your money."}

{"Author": "Ed N.", "Date": "on January 17, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Consider others before paying for this.", "Text": "Okay, so first I will say that although I had a lot of issues, they seem to finally be resolved. I am laying out these issues and the solution that I found in hopes that maybe someone else won't be as frustrated as I was.\n\nFirst, I have an electric heating system with heat pump/heat strips. I am not an HVAC professional but I have successfully wired a thermostat at my old home without much issue. This thing, was far from easy. I have one thermostat downstairs and one upstairs, both different zones on the same system.\nI wired the downstairs thermostat and everything seemed to be good. I based it on the wiring diagram I got online from the Nest website. I wired the one upstairs and same thing. I thought it was fine. Seemed to click on and off when i adjusted it. That was until I went to bed. I woke up to temps way higher than what the thermostat was set to. The highest at one point in the morning was 78 degrees! This was from the from the 67 it was set to. I knew something must be wrong and I tried to switch it off...but it didn't respond. I did a hard reset and it finally went off. I called nest and sat on hold for a very long time. When I finally got someone I got as far as telling them the problem, then I got disconnected. I called back, more time on hold, explain again. I went through 45 mins of troubleshooting and the rep finally said she thought the Y terminal was bad and to return/exchange it. I took it off the wall, but had to leave. After thinking about it, I realized what the problem must be. The downstairs thermostat had a wire in the wrong place. The signal wasn't being sent from the upstairs thermostat, but from a wire downstairs. Since I have a heat pump, W should have been in the OB spot. I figured this out, rewired it, and so far for the last 24 hours all has been good.\nAside from that, it works well as it is supposed to. The temp is accurate, the system responds quickly to it, and the look of it (although bigger than expected) is not bad. I mainly bought this because I am away from the house a lot. I want to be able to use my phone to control it. I also have Nest Protects, and this is supposed to work in conjunction with those in case of smoke or CO2. Overall though, the tech support was crap and the \"ease of installation\" was anything but easy. So buyer beware, if you don't know what you are doing, you should probably get someone who does to install it for you. Would I buy it again? Probably not. I have had the Honeywell wireless thermostat in my old house and it was far easier to install and use. Hopefully this helps someone. I don't find it to be worth the 250 I paid for each of them at Lowes."}

I was choosing between the Nest or the EcoBee. After extensive research I decided to buy the Nest thermostat. I actually bought it at Kohl's, not Amazon. The installation was super easy to install, took me around 10 to 15 minutes. I spent more time reading the instructions than actually installing. Once installed, it was a quick step by step guide on connecting it to the wi-fi and then downloading the app from my phone where I can then control the thermostat from my phone. I tested it out by turning on/off the fan and it worked. So far I have only had it for 3 days so I can't really say it's bad or fantastic, that is why I just gave it 3 stars (neutral rating). Plus I live in South Florida and the weather here has been pretty cold (between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit) so I've had my A/C off for over 2 weeks. I'll add an additional review down the road....if I remember too."}

When we got our first real cold snap the unit died, stopped charging on its base. This is a huge problem if you can't count on your thermostat when for over 20 days we didn't even get to 20 as a high.(Fahrenheit) Throw in a 1 year old at home and a new mom it is a recipe for frustration. It can be removed and charged via. a port on the back but if it's not on its dock it isn't doing its job. WE would have to charge it twice a day for about an hour.\n\nNest customer service is great and bent over backward to help. First they said it was a bad battery, and sent me a new unit. This worked for abbot 5 days till the same issues. Battery dying and not charging on the base. After more nest support they agreed that for one reason or another my HVAC system was not compatible with the 4 wire set up. My entire HVAC is all of 3 years old. NEST again was great. I found a local NEST expert to come out and install a 5th wire. NEST did (well will) re-reimburse me for the cost.\n\nThe NEST certified installer said he has been upgrading around 7 of these a week to 5 wire system. This is just one of the dozens of certified technicians in my area.This is where my huge frustration lies. NEST greatly exaggerates the compatibility or the unit. This is the main reasons I purchased the nest over it's competitors. they advertise it's ability to work on four wire systems and most the competitors do not. So if you live in an area that it get's cold beware if need be send them the serial and model # on your furnace to double check it's compatibility."}

I work from home a lot, and do not walk past the thermostat enough to indicate I am home. If you are gone more I could see this being a nice feature.\n\nThere are directions in the box and lots of videos in line to help you install this yourself. I was able to install easily by myself. My biggest problem was the wire hole behind my old thermostat was larger than expected and they had messed up the drywall pretty good with holes installing the old one.

The package also provides labels that you can stick to the cable so you know which cable to connect. The most important thing is be sure the electricity going to the AC/Heater control has been shut off. The voltage might not be strong enough to get yourself hurt, but just be safe."}

The instructions were simple, clear and easy to follow. Nest's goal is for customers to have the thing up and running in less than 30 minutes. I ran into two tiny problems, neither of which should discourage you from buying and installing one.\n\n1. I had some trouble mounting the Nest to the backing plate the first time. To control the nest, you turn the metal ring on the outside and then push the Nest to click it, like a mouse. If it's not mounted correctly, the click-like-a-mouse doesn't work. It took me a few tries. Maybe I'm just clumsy. Once the locking tabs were engaged, it worked fine.\n2. Don't expect it to light up right away once it's installed. The display remains dark for a couple of minutes while it wakes up, brushes its teeth, checks its circuits and so on. Be patient.\n\nInstalling the smartphone app, and controlling the Nest from the app or the webpage, is painless. I object to the huge stack of permissions the app requires (why does it need access to my Contacts?) but that doesn't really apply here. I'll take that up on the Google App Store.\n\nONE FINAL NOTE: We've only had the Nest for two days. Always be wary of reviews posted within a day or two of receipt of something. Check back in a few months to see if this review has changed."}

Make sure to run the compatibility checker with the wires going to your current thermostat before purchasing. It took an hour or so for the firmware/software to update after the thermostat was installed and initial settings were entered. Afterwards, I used the Android App on my smartphone to set a schedule and I linked it to my Echo and Insteon apps. Auto Scheduling was useless to me since the thermostat is in a room rarely used. My furnace has two stage heating and the Nest thermostat can control it with an extra wire, but after reading the furnace manufacturer's website, I felt it was better to let the furnace determine for itself which stage to run. I also came to this same conclusion for running my whole house humidifier. The Nest Thermostat can run it, with an extra wire in the * slot, but I believe the manufacturer's humidistat with the outdoor sensor and independent blower control does the same thing and is geared specifically for my equipment. I like that I get a daily view of the furnace on/off cycles and how many hours it runs per day on my smartphone. I really love the ability to control the thermostat remotely via my smartphone app and through my Echos, my main reasons for getting it. As for the energy savings, that still has to be determined. If you're replacing a 7 day properly programmed thermostat, you'll probably see very little difference. If you are replacing a non-programmable thermostat, then the savings could be substantial, especially if you use the ECO temperatures at night and when away from the home."}

Support is awful", "Text": "Replaced my programmable thermostat with the Nest one year ago. The Nest has two advantages over my programmable:\n\n1. You can use an app on your smart phone to adjust the temperature while you are away.\n2. You can set up home/away assist to automatically adjust the temperature when nobody is home.\n\nThe first feature is nice but not one I use often. The second feature is a great way to save energy without sacrificing comfort. However, I was having trouble with it when I first installed the thermostat. So I called tech. support and was told that this feature doesn't work if you set the temperature to adjust on a schedule. I like to set the temperature to go down at night, and I figure that will save more energy than the home/away feature, so I regretted replacing my basic programmable thermostat. Eventually I started working on my settings and was able to make it work on my own, no thanks to tech. support.\n\nI was very happy with my thermostat until one week before its \"first birthday.\" Then it started reducing the temperature on its own (during a record cold spell), even when one my wife was home. So I contacted tech. support again. This time they told me that Home/Away assist can only be connected to one phone. If it is connected to two phones, that \"confuses\" the thermostat. The problem with this is that we don't want the thermostat to turn itself down if either one of us is home. Who would pay for that feature? My other issue is that it seems hard to believe that it took a year for the thermostat to get confused. The tech. support person suggested that we manually switch the thermostat to away mode when we leave the house. That doesn't work for me because we will never consistently remember to do that, and anyway it is more work than just turning down the temperature (which I could also do with my old thermostat).\n\nI decided to try a new tech. support chat today. I spent an hour and a half on the chat, including an hour and 15 minutes of waiting. Then we got disconnected. So I give up. I will use it like my old programmable thermostat. Making it work properly will never be worth the time I have to invest."}

Once installed hooking it up to the Nest app on my phone was very easy. It walked me through each step. Connecting it to Alexa also went very smoothly. I like the ease in checking settings, energy usage as well temperature, humidity levels. Adjusting temp is very easy by simply turning the outer ring. Everything can be done on the actual thermostat by simply turning the outer ring and pressing the lens cover on the front. The thermostat will learn how I like my home temps adjusted over the next few days and eventually will automatically adjust temps. but I can also adjust it or set my own schedules if desired. Today when I left for work I turned the temp down. Before I left work to go home I opened my Alexa app on my phone and reset the temp to a warmer setting. By the time I got home the temperature had risen to the warmer setting so the house was warm when I walked in. It also has the ability to automatically adjust temps up/down whenever you leave your home or return by sensing the location of your phone. It's only been 24 hours since I turned it on but I have been very pleased with its operation."}

If you do not have a functioning control wire (usually the blue wire) and the temps get below zero outside, some HVAC systems quit powering the Nest thermostat and it just turns off because the battery drains out. The temp solution is to disconnect the yellow wire which controls the air conditioning. That will get the furnace working again. It also means you need to remember in the spring to hook up the yellow wire again or you will have no AC. The long term solution is to get an HVAC repairman to hook up a common wire to the Control port of the Nest so the battery will always receive power. The only redeeming part of this review was the Nest support person I dealt with (Alexis) was very helpful and spent the time to answer all of my questions and wait patiently for about an hour as we fixed the problem. That good support person got it up to a 2 star review."}

Nicely starting the heating process *the moment you walk back in* so by the time you go to bed you're warm enough to take your parka off?\n\nThen buy a Nest!\n\n(Bonus: you get the opposite effect in the summer!)\n\nIf you don't want to walk into a frigid house every day, you can simply: turn Nest's ability to recognize that you've left the house off! Or manually schedule the house to warm up every day whether you've left or not! Either way, overriding all of the \"smarts\" of this thermostat and all of your energy savings!\n\nI've owned two Nest thermostats and three Nest Protects for two years. I've had plenty of issues with them... I was more enthusiastic at first, but then I noticed that my energy bills were not meaningfully lower (don't presume you will pay much less!) and functionality that used to work no longer did.\n\nBut this one is the kicker. It's a problem that most people would run into - seasonal variation. Nest support/engineering seem totally clueless and unresponsive about it, and I've noticed this is a widely shared/posted issue.\n\nFolks at Nest... A \"smart\" thermostat with the ability to sense when you're away and turn your thermostat off has to be smart enough to a) turn it back on *prior* to you arriving home, unless it figures you're going to be away for a while, and b) not let it get so cold or hot that you lose all energy savings benefit in the process. Isn't this obvious??? Maybe this just isn't a big problem in the Bay Area."}

A few tips:\n\n- Use their little online tool and figure out if your system is compatible before you get started.\n- If you have a Carrier Infinity or similar system with \"ABCD\" wires, you are out of luck.\n- Take a picture of your thermostat wiring before you start removing wires.\n- Turn off the breaker to both your condenser AND your air handler, otherwise you're going to get a little 24v zap when you are connecting this. :) It won't kill you, but it will get your attention.\n- Take your time, do it once and do it right.\n\nOnce installed it is very elegant and the user interface is smart.

The Nest seems to think it knows what I want more than I do. Not a day goes by where I bump up the heat and 15 minutes later, Nest has reversed it. It's maddening. I have three of these. They're not cheap. I'm not as concerned with pinching pennies as I am with feeling comfortable in my own house. But Nest seems to think it knows what's best for me. Now, there is a way to turn off the learning features on the Nest. But in that case, I'd have saved a lot of money & hassle and gone with a more standard wifi enabled thermostat from someone like honeywell.\n\nThe install gave me some issues, as well. Having a gas heater & an electric central AC, I came to the conclusion after searching online for awhile that I had a dual fuel system. After trying to set things up myself, I ran into issues and called Nest support who told me that I need an HVAC pro to setup dual fuel - they refused to offer any further guidance or help. After some head scratching, I called the pro, who came out and told me I had a single fuel system. From there, things worked great. If only I had known that from the start. Nest supports self install on single fuel systems, but the documentation didn't really help me figure which I had - it's a terminology I've only ever encountered with Nest.\n\nOtherwise, Nest has been great. I like the humidity readings, and the graphs. I do have issues with one or more of the thermostats going offline randomly for half a day. In hindsight, though, I wouldn't buy a Nest again. I'd try a different wifi thermostat; probably a honeywell."}

We have the thermostat, cameras, Protect, and Secure. One of the advantages of having all the items working together is their \"Home/Away assist\" that lets you turn on or off cameras and set the thermostat to eco mode when you enable the security system. Unfortunately, it doesn't work on the thermostat most of the time. We enable the security system which sets our home/away assist parameters into motion. Certain cameras turn on or off, and the thermostat should go into eco mode, but it doesn't. Most of the time. Sometimes it does, but there is no rhyme or reason that I can discern as to why it works or doesn't work. There are multiple reports of this behavior online and I do not see an effort by Nest to fix the issue.\nAdditionally, I am concerned about the internal battery. The thermostat will not work without it, and Nest does not sell replacement batteries or a service to replace them. So after a few years you have to throw out the whole thermostat?? That's incredibly wasteful but will keep the revenue stream going for them if people keep buying new ones. I know I won't be.\nDo yourself a favor and don't get this device."}

This was my 3rd thermostat I have installed and the hardest yet, the wires didn't match with what I had in the wall previously so I called the support line and they had me switch a few (this was just to get the unit connected and turned on) so now that I had power I hung up and proceeded to test the unit well.... It blew cold air when it was on heat then blew hot hair when it was on cool, back on the phone with support, this girl was less than useless it seemed like I was bothering her by calling, she would have me change a wire and each time I would have to run to the breaker shut off the power then rewire it, test it to see it failed then run back to the breaker and try again (thermostat on 22nd floor and breaker outside) in the end the girls recommendation was to switch the heating wire and the cooling wire... This ended up not solving the problem because the condensor wouldn't run and push the cold air when it was on cool, at this point I was so annoyed with the girl putting me on mute and taking forever to respond once I had completed a step I hung up and found the answer on Reddit... I basically had to rig the system to think I had a heat pump (which I do not I live in AZ) so now the thermostat is finally running my system properly....\n\nNow comes the annoying dumb smart tech, the system is PREset with a schedule and that would cause it to randomly set to a temperature I did not select and then heat my home up way too much, this I only realized while I was working and started sweating because I went up 3 degrees before I finally realized what it had done... Once I deleted it's preset schedule I thought I was in the clear, that was until the system suddenly decided I was away and kicked into another preset thing that changed the temperature on its on and stopped heating even though I was home (i work from home and rarely leave during the day) this was another setting I had to look for and disable since it was not working properly...\n\nAll in all I am extremely disappointed with this thermostat and I feel like I paid $200 for the ability to change the temperature from my phone, I do not recommend this product for anyone that works from home, might be better if you are away a lot and want to setup A schedule to have your system run automatically when you are away, just hope you never have to call tech support because you will be disappointed too"}

It was $50 off and after friends raved about the savings they got, I figured I might as well join in the fun. I never unpackaged it because then I realized this was an impulse purchase.\n\nMy home is about a year old. Its HVAC system is brand new and it's all being control through a Honeywell programmable thermostat, which in essence already has all of the functionality of the Nest built-in, save for the \"Learning\" phase and the ability to control through WiFi.\n\nThen I began talking to coworkers and friends about their experience. They all said the same thing: they took the Nest off from Learning and merely preprogrammed it to turn on at certain times to control the temperature. However, they all liked the ability to control via WiFi in case they knew they'd be out of the house longer or wanted a specific temperature for when they arrived. So in reality, I was paying for just the WiFi capability.\n\nDon't get me wrong: the Nest has lots of promise if your thermostat is the old kind (the one with the sliders). But if you already have a programmable thermostat, then this is seriously throwing money down the drain. You'll get little benefit for a larger price.\n\nI won't recommend any competitors, but I can say that the thermostat my house came with is more than capable of handling my ventilation needs."}

This has cost me nearly $1,300.00 in the last few months (not including the cost of it)- definitely not 'paying for itself' over time.\n\nI'm a fan of home automation and use quite a few different products and they certainly work as intended. I decided to try the Nest Thermostat due to the savings and convenience.\n\nThe first couple of months it worked fine and as advertised. However at the start of month three, there were many issues. I thought perhaps I wired it incorrectly or installed it wrong, so I payed a 'Nest Pro' (Local HVAC contractors trained to fix Nest products) to come take a look. Nothing was wrong, was still charged $200.\n\nThe issue is that it only uses emergency heat, instead of the normal furnace. I live in Nashville, TN and now it's cold, like 15-20 degrees cold.\n\nApparently to fix this issue, it needs to connect to the network. This unit will not connect to the network. I've changed router settings, bought two new routers, basically have done everything to try to make sure the network is visible. No other product has an issue connecting to my wireless (My neighbor can even connect his xbox to my wireless and play online games with no lag!).\n\nAux/Emergency heat is very, very expensive. Our bill has doubled from what it was last winter and we even had two additional people renting out our basement and running heat constantly last year. (picture attached). Now we have no heat running to the basement and the area of our house that needs it is only 1,100^sqft.\n\nNow that it's really cold and I really, really need a working thermostat- I try calling Nest support (you can either call or chat with them) and i'm on hold for almost three hours before I give up (Picture attached).\n\nOf course, these issues popped up a month after my amazon return window closed and I can't get in touch with Nest Support. I'm not sure what I can do other than just go buy an old thermostat and pay someone else to hook it up (or just magically hope that it somehow connects to my network).\n\nDefinitely one of the worst decisions I've made as a homeowner."}

{"Author": "DermDoc", "Date": "on December 21, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Beware Nest Home/Away Assist", "Text": "I love it but beware Nest Home/Away Assist. I think I finally figured out why I wasn't saving money on energy when away from home for extended periods. My conclusion is that most home users with a smart home need to fine tune the nest aware feature. My home has several smart gadgets because I enjoy tinkering with technology if nothing else. So the lights automatically coming on and off, the Roomba cleaning the floors and similar while away will fool Nest into thinking someone is home and turn your setting to the 'Home' setting if you allow other Nest gadgets (Nest protect, cam etc) to be part of the nest aware setup. I believe the best is to allow only the Nest thermostat and maybe your smart phone to control Nest Home/Away Assist. You see, I'd leave home and manually set it to 'Away' but it would revert to the learned schedule within a day or so. This despite the fact that my smart phone is part of the nest aware setup. Nest will in fact report that it is now ignoring your phone as part of the Nest Home/Away Assist setup as the phone has not reported its location in a while. Not sure why it does this as in fact I do have very restricted location reporting for my phone but the Nest App is one of the few allowed exceptions. The Nest protect smoke/carbon monoxide detectors in particular are very sensitive to light and motion and I have 12 of these in my home. Movement and lights coming on and off will be registered very efficiently by them. Anyhow, it took me about a yr of use to figure this out. Indeed you could just turn off the heat or cooling when away for extended periods and Nest would still turn them on if your house reached your critical temperature settings. In the cold you may have frozen water pipes by then. For me making Nest Home/Away Assist less sensitive is more useful. I'm currently travelling away from home and trying this out for the first time and so far my theory seems to hold true. I must add that part of my conclusion is based on the fact that I have a separate Nest thermostat setup at my office where it is the only feed for Nest Home/Away Assist and that setup has followed the schedule appropriately for a long time. This also may have delayed my diagnosis as I always believed the App on my phone which controls both setups was incapable of controlling both setups accurately. A false preconceived notion led to the wrong diagnosis. You'd think I'd know better, I have medical training after all.\n\nEdit\n12/29/2018\nI have changed the title and narrative of my discussion as in fact the feature I should have originally discussed is called Nest Home/Away Assist. Additionally, I can report that my thermostat has stayed in the Away mode the whole time I have been away. I'm now convinced more that ever that the Home/Away Assist nature needs fine tuning based on your installation environment"}
{"Author": "ecu_reviews", "Date": "on December 21, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "My Nest is better than true love!", "Text": "If I can install this... Anyone can!\n\nSo, when I first bought thing, I was nervous about getting it installed. I had an electrician lined up (even thought they wanted an arm and a leg to install it)... Well, I am not a patient person, so I decided to take my Nest out of the box and see if I could figure this whole installation thing out... OMG, EASY PEASY!!!!! I turned off my system at the breaker box, took off the face of the old thermostat, took a picture of the wires and continued to disassemble.\n\nOK, I was 1/3 of the way there - yay me! I start to unpack the Nest from the box and look at all the parts and felt confident I could do this. I have the instructions out and was following them step by step. The only time I had to go to The Google was when it came to hooking up the wires... I have no problem with the Red, Green or White... Yellow confused me, but The Google came through and explained that if I didn't have a multi-zoned system I needed to use Y1. All hooked up, face of my pretty, shiny, perfect Nest was on! Woohoo!\n\nBack to the breaker box, turn on my HVAC system and low and behold my perfect Nest was practically smiling at me! I followed the prompts on the screen - tentatively at first because I was worried she was fragile - and step by step I became more comfortable using the device.\n\nEven better than a pretty face - SHE WORKS! I set my temperature and BINGO, fan and heat kicked on! I was so excited, I called my neighbors over to come and see my handy work and called the guy I was seeing at the time to tell him that he was in fact incorrect - I didn't need a man to install and set this up for me (we're not talking anymore, btw)...\n\nAny questions I had, I went to the Nest twitter page, asked my questions via DM, and the replies have been prompt and polite. My questions have been answered satisfactorily and I was able to keep truckin'.\n\nNow, she knows when I am home, and syncs with my life - My Nest has given me one less thing to worry about... I can crawl into bed and set the temperature where I want it and be comfortable. Full disclosure, I had a digital programmable thermostat before. What I like most about my Nest is being able to have more control over my energy bill: I'm at work and I decide to meet the girls for a drink. The heat isn't running waiting for me to come home. Instead, when I get in the car (I work about 15 minutes from home), I open the app, set the temperature and when I get home the house feels cozy! If I stay up late and don't want the temperature to drop before I hit the sack, I can set it when I crawl into bed... Sleeping in late, when I get up, I open the app, set the temperature and in 10 minutes, I can hop out of bed and not freeze! She's learning how I live and makes adjustments based on my \"schedule\" and she knows based on my iPhone's location services if I have left the house for a quick minute, am running errands in the hood or am just going out to gossip with neighbors or if I am out of town... She doesn't turn on the heat or AC just because the house sitter came in to feed the manimals.\n\nI love seeing the hours (actual amount of time) that I am using the heat (or AC).\n\nWhen my HVAC guys came the other day for a plumbing issue (completely unrelated to my Nest) they took one look at her and couldn't stop telling me how \"sleek\" she looks and asking questions... Apparently the guy they had at their company to install smart devices had a very hard time installing them and explaining to residents how to use them... I was shocked! I couldn't speak for other devices - but told them that if I could install the Nest a trained professional should have no problem! They offered me a job - LOL.\n\nI can't say enough good things about my Nest. She's perfect. If she were a dude, I'd seriously try to find him on Bumble... ;)"}

My daughter in law did the rest as I am not a real tech savvy person. I especially like the app that allows me to set the temp in my house at temps I want for a week. It can be set up to be cool at night and warm up when you get up. I also noticed a difference in my bill this month. My home is heated with gas and the gas was cheaper than the electric this month.

I had to call a few HVAC companies before I found someone who could do the work. So the point is that you shouldn't expect an easy installation in all cases. There is a good chance that you will have to spend serious money getting this thing installed.\n\nUpdate: So after the expensive installation, I am now having a very difficult time getting this thing to connect to wi- fi and simply to work.

I feel like my home is controlled by Jarvis from Iron Man *Thanks Amazon*!\n\nI had read the reviews and did my homework so I was a bit prepped for possible failure. The install was simple and the WIFI UI connection wasn't too difficult. I did find the initial instructions forgot to mention \"multiple reboots possible\" and while my unit updated and rebooted 3 times, each time asking me to confirm settings I already entered it works great. I never new a unit like this was so easy to install and I am so happy I got it.\n\n*** update from July 2018\nDuring the winter months I noticed the nest started causing my unit to power off and on fast. Along with that I noticed a loud noise coming from the unit. In the early summer i assumed some maintenance issue was occurring on the unit outside. After getting 2 certified technicians to review the unit, they determined the Nest is the culprit. For whatever reason the Nest is causing my unit to power on and off even when it hasn't reached to temperature I had it set for. It would disengage the cooling each power off which created a loud noise.\n\nI still haven't found a solution and my unit is now louder than an airplane, scaring a few dogs on my block. I'll have to research this some more to find out what is wrong with the Nest product. It still functions well aside from creating this loud noise."}

The interface is super sleek and minimal, and I love that it programs itself to the temps that you like as time goes on. My mother who lives with us is known to sneak by and turn the temperature down so everyone is freezing without knowing why. Well ha! Now I can change it back on my phone!

The red power cable (R) didn't have a label, but a help article said I could place it in either the Rc or Rh position. I picked Rh (for heating as she doesn't have central air). After stripping and trimming the wires, I placed them in their correct locations that depressed once seated properly. Then I slapped on the device, turned the power all on and waited for boot up. Everything was self explainatory. She have had it for about one week and it is still learning her schedule. Hopefully it will start predicting what she wants soon.

I was up and running in about 5 minutes. My only gripe is the scheduler on the app. The days of the week are down the left and the hours of the day are across the bottom. If you want to schedule a time/temp, you just go to the day, then click on the time you want, then adjust to the temp you want it to be. Seems easy enough, however, you have to add every single time you want to change the temp, and the hours are in 2 hour increments, so if you want to have the temp go down at 10:30, it's almost impossible to get the right time. I usually settle for something close. I've only had it for a little over a week, so I really can't tell yet if I've saved anything on utilities, but by looking at my usage (usually less than 2 hours each day and I live in Wisconsin), I think I may be pleasantly surprised."}

Love the technology of this thermostat and the fact that I can control it with Amazon's Echo. The Nest app is also a plus as I've found it easy to use. Since I only recently installed it (well, my HVAC installer did) it hasn't learned anything about our schedule so it'll be a while before we get the benefit of the auto programming.\n\nA note about their tech support. I had found support for our Nest cams to be excellent. Not so for the thermostat. I used the chat feature to ask a very simple question about the Nest thermostat: how to you change the setting so that the fan only runs when the system is cooling or heating. My installer had set it to run all the time. The agent had no clue . While he was posting links to Nest help articles that has nothing to do with my question, I figured out how to do it. When he asked for a photo of the wiring I told him I had figured it out so no need for a photo. Did he ask me how to set the fan to only run when cooling or heating so he could help the next customer? Nope! He just asked if there was anything else he could help with. I don't blame the agent, I blame Nest for not educating the agent. Of course he could have asked me to educate himself.\n\nFortunately, Nest has a lot of documentation on their site to help customers answer their own questions."}

The only difficulty was when I wanted to connect my humidifier, which is built in to my furnace, to the nest. I hired a nest \"pro\" from the nest website, and had to endure 3 different visits from technicians who were completely unfamiliar with the nest. Finally I called Nest's support telephone line and after waiting for almost 30 minutes, I was told nest has a policy where they cannot discuss or give any guidance on using a humidifier with a nest; despite the copious amount of nest literature online which attests to the fact that nest was designed to work with humidifiers. I explained to the nest phone rep that I had a \"pro\" at my house who was referred to me by their own nest website, and I wanted to have the pro get on the phone with nest support so they could advise him. They refused to speak with their \"pro\" since a humidifier was involved. So that left me to do my own research about how best to connect the humidifier, and it involved installing a different electrical relay which reduced the humidifier's control wires from 2 down to 1, since the nest has only 1 wire port (star port) for humidifier control. But once the humidifier was properly connected to the nest, I could not be happier. The nest allows you to set your target indoor relative humidity, and then it factors in regional weather data from the internet and indoor humidity levels to decide when and for how long to run the humidifier. In my particular situation I needed the humidifier to activate with the blower fan, not just my furnace. That way I can humidify my whole house during wood stove season when my furnace never turns on, simply by running the blower. The nest automatically kicks on my blower when it senses indoor relative humidity has dropped below the threshold I set, so its operation is set it and forget it. No more running downstairs to adjust the humidistat dial, and no more outdoor temperature sensors. A hot water tap is a must-have if you are running the humidifier on just the blower fan without the hot furnace air since warmed water evaporates best."}

The outer ring selects the typewriter keys and clicking the main body of the thermostat enters choice but initially that wasn't intuitive at least for me. Long WiFi passwords and especially symbols were time consuming to enter. In addition to setting up the WiFi connection, the nest needs code to set up the account and control from the web. Setting up the account ahead of time helped with that portion of the set-up. Choose to have the thermostat installed by pro which I picked out from the Amazon purchase page. While that increased the cost overall, my local hvac tech charged $150 to install, the positive was no issues with compatibility or possibility of shorting out the device and or heat pump which would have been sub-optimal. In hindsight the instructions to self install seemed relatively straightforward, power down match up wires and power on, and that should work for most in home applications. Also went ahead and purchased the warranty from Amazon which helped because the local HVAC doesn't warranty homeowner supplied parts. Post install tip, controlling features from the app is much easier than trying to settings at the thermostat. Auto cycle fan setting was not easy to figure out from the thermostat but turning off from the web app was easy peasy. The thermostat lights up and using the auto setting prevents getting blasted by lighted dial at night. The room temp is super easy to read even from across the room and with the Alexa app is light years better than previous mercury bulb switched mechanical thermostat. Lastly caught the Nest on sale on Black Friday and saved a bunch off the regular price by doing that. After almost a week of using the thermostat it has performed flawlessly. Will be interested to see how the learning function goes since the temp has been constant during this time-frame. Suspect that the thermostat will have more data to go on as the winter months progress. Shipping on the Nest was next day, unbelievably fast and no charge with Prime."}

You have to select your wifi network from the device screen and then fumble through entering your password with the front dial. And heaven forbid you have spaces in your password or other special characters, those are pretty annoying to find and enter. Why doesn't the Nest use Bluetooth from a smartphone to automatically pair with your home WiFi? Why can't I enter my WiFi password on my phone screen instead of the annoying dial?

In these days of instant feedback, Nest asks for a summary immediately after registering the product. A couple of weeks after installation, Nest, would give the consumer more time to provide worthwhile experience on the product. Thanks."}

This kinda bummed me out, but after watching several YouTube tutorials I was sure he was wrong. Upon installing I found that he was in-fact wrong. I have it connected to a red, white and blue wire. I never had the AC installed so i am not sure if it will need another wire or not. Currently it is working perfectly and have yet to have a single issue with it in 6 months. Installation was quick and simple for someone like me who had never done any type of electrical work other then changing a light bulb.\n\nWe have it connected to Amazon Alexa and to control from our phones. It recognizes our phones when we leave or come home and goes into eco mode certain times of the day. I also set it to start a warm up in the mornings before I get out of bed.\n\nSo far, I have noticed a decrease in our power bill compared to last winter. We are down about $50 a month compared to this time last winter. I love that I can check the status or change my heat from anywhere especially with my animals home all the time.\n\nOverall this was a fantastic buy and we are very happy with it. The only complaint I have is the fact that if the thermostat is set in eco mode or off mode I can not use voice control to turn it back on. This isn\u2019t a deal breaker so I would say this is just something Nest should consider fixing in the near future otherwise we are happy!"}

Very stylish. Ease of install could not have been better. They even provide an optional mounting plate and screwdriver for the install. Turn off breaker, record which wire went where on the old thermostat, then reconnect to the same terminals on the Nest. Breaker back on and it boots up in a few seconds. Connect to Wifi, then it walks you through the rest of the install asking a few questions, then even lets you run through test cycles to make sure it is working well. You have to download the app, then input a code the unit displays to activate fully. Then, in my case, I linked my Nest account to my Alexa account (in the Alexa app) and I have voice control. Worked like a charm, both in setup and voice control, so far.\n\nMy son had a Gen1 Nest and he complained all the time that it would not 'see' them in the house (since they were on the other side of the house) and assume they were away. Not a concern any more. Now you get Geofencing as an option. You can tell it to use the GPS in your phone or tablet to 'know' when you are home and when you leave and adjust accordingly (per your guidelines). It even will let you share the app features with others in the house, so it knows if one phone left, but the other is here, to assume you are home (unless one of you forgot your phone, of course).\n\nMake sure to go back to the settings menu and scroll through each. You can set up the display to show the current temp, current setting (including high/low range if set for auto-changeover from heat to cool), or even the current outdoor temp and expected temps for the next 4/8/12 hours (which it gets from the Weather channel, when you set it up and tell it your zip code).\n\nI'll update again if I end up with any negatives, but have to give it time to learn our habits to see if it will save us anything in the long run. If not, still happy just getting the automation with app and voice control."}

I did not purchase through Amazon but through my place of work (because we get a discount). I am the type of person that tries to save $$$ where I can. One of those ways was trying to remember to adjust my thermostat to a higher temp before leaving for work each morning. Usually being in a rush or too tired to remember, I wasn't always successful in being consistent doing this. Since I have installed my NEST though and connected it to my phone via the NEST app, it knew the first time I was away and adjusted the temp on its own based on my settings. It's easy to set it and forget it. I can check and adjust the temp in my home anytime from anywhere. I haven't had it for a full electric billing period yet but I'm pretty confident this was an investment that will pay for itself pretty quickly.\n\nI had read in a previous review that someone returned the device because the display shows the temperature the thermostat is set to in the big numbers and the actual temperature is harder to see. While this is initially true in the default setting, there is an option in the menu to reverse the display so that the actual temperature will be the main large display and the set to temp will be the smaller. I guess they didn't take the time to figure that out."}

The installation was very quick and straightforward \u2013 no surprises there. The Nest thermostat accurately learned my consistent daily schedule for nearly a week, then I went away on a long trip, setting the system to \u201caway.\u201d Checking on it with the app two days later, I discovered that someone apparently came home in the early morning of the day after I left, restoring the auto-programmed heat cycle. Then they seemingly left later that morning, consequently re-triggering the \u201caway\u201d mode, yet no one was supposed to be home at all. An early morning burglary? I had someone check on the house but there was no evidence of a forced entry. What went wrong? The thermostat evidently detected my unusually early movements on the morning of my departure, and then, in my absence, precisely repeated these actions the following day. When I reset the \u201caway\u201d mode remotely, the system remained that way for the duration of my trip. The take-home lesson: don\u2019t walk past the thermostat after you\u2019ve told it that you\u2019ve gone away!"}

Default settings cause very annoying / mysterious things to happen. Enter a room and the temperature suddenly sets to 80 degrees. Leave and it goes down to 60. Out of the box the default settings have the occupancy sensor enabled to try and figure out when you\u2019re home and when you\u2019re not (note that NEST also sells a lot of this data - it\u2019s part of their business plan), then there\u2019s the annoying \u201ceco\u201d default settings that further try to save money. And then there\u2019s the auto scheduling based on your behavior. All in all this is maddening. If you just want to be able to set the temperature and have the room actually be that temperature (amazing!), you have to disable about 5 default settings - something you likely only realize after everyone in the house is begging you to return the nest thermostat.\n\nI wish I had gotten the Honeywell or ecobee instead.\n\nOnly positive to the nest is being able to change the temperature when I\u2019m\nNot home, but all thermostats basically do that today.\n\nI hate this thermostat.

Thermostat re-imagined!", "Text": "In doing my research, it came down to 2 products for the \"smart\" thermostat device. After reviewing product specifics, user experiences and ease of install experiences, I decided to go with the Nest. I am very happy that I did. The great experience starts when you navigate to the Nest website, where they have almost anything in terms of information you need to know prior to buying.\n\nOnce the product arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at the completeness and thoughtfulness of the accessories packaged with the device. They include stickers to identify the cables before disconnecting from your existing thermostat - just in case they are not correctly color coded, a flat screw driver that is required for the install is included. That is a first and very welcome indeed. The installation instructions included and the accessories for the install include a wall plate and screws for replacement of a bigger thermostat as well. Definitely welcome and very much appreciated.\n\nThe install itself went very smoothly. I did run into an issue, where my previous thermostat was not using a Common wire but the cable to the thermostat had that wire but unused. I connected the Common to the common terminal on the Nest and the thermostat did not go live on turning on both the furnace and air conditioner. I disconnected the common terminal and restarted and the Nest came up with no issues. I just wanted to put this out there, in case somebody else runs into the same issue.\n\nOnce live, installing the Smartphone app and have the Nest connect to the internet were a piece of cake. Very intuitive and well organized and the UI is well executed. Love the aesthitic of the device on the wall.\n\nIt also helped that I got a pretty steep discount from my Energy provider (SDG&E) in San Diego. With the discount of the utility and the $50 discount that Nest offered, this made the device purchase a no brainer. Having had the device, I think the device is worth the full price for the vision and utility value of a hitherto overlooked/undervalued device in our homes.\n\nVery happy camper, as this is a but a building block in a smart home. It integrates with most of the smart integration options and adds a lot of value in such an installation. I look forward to have more building blocks in place and to having the whole house automated and truly \"smart\"."}

What you will find all over the internet is that the Nest needs a common wire or it will short cycle your furnace. What you won't find all over the internet is that if you have a common wire and it still short cycles your furnace, there is no solution for you. If I switch back to my old thermostat, no short cycling. There is literally no good reason for this malfunction to be happening. Because it worked properlyon my A/C for two weeks, I threw the box away so I can't return this now, which is infuriating. The best part is, I can't get my house warm without taking it off the wall and installing my old thermostat.

Very easy to install and to connect to the wi-fi. The first month it was installed, it appears I saved about $12 on our electric bill and kept the house more comfortable. Since the Nest thermostat is self learning, it quickly learned that we like to set the temperature cooler in the evening, warmer in the morning, and then a couple degrees cooler durning the days we are home, and automatically adjusts, keeping your house in a more comfortable range. It also knows if you are not home and self adjusts to save energy. I would definitely buy again. To my knowledge, it is the only self learning thermostat on the market. (A friend has the Eco-bee and has to program it himself.) We love being able to adjust the temp in the middle of the night with our cell phone with out getting out of bed."}

The only way around this is to leave the power on my AC system year round, which is not what I'd like to do. A more troubling issue is since I installed the Nest unit I have to occasionally (averaging once a week) cycle power on my boiler or reset the Nest to get heat in the house! This is unacceptable! I've been working with the nest support personnel (actually quite a good experience considering the situation) for 2 weeks or so on this issue and now the 30 day return window is closed at amazon and I can't return this $250 disk on my wall.

Set up of the Nest is a little tricky with anything other than a single fuel system. I'm fairly mechanically inclined and had to watch a video on YouTube to find out exactly how to set up the dual-fuel system. You have to access the Pro settings, if you feel uncomfortable doing that, calling a professional to install it would be a good idea. We had an older programmable thermostat but it didn't offer the flexibility the Nest does. The schedule feature is really nice but the fact that the unit learns the adjustments you make and starts to make them for you is really nice. We've only had the unit for a week, but so far it's already so much better than our old thermostat. Being able to access it from the app is a big plus. Ours was provided at no cost by our electric company, in addition we get rebates every year for using it. We were already thinking about buying one so this was a no-brainer for us."}

I just bought a home in Denver and this climate has large swings in temps, one day it can snow, that next is like a Spring or Summer. The result is that I got tired of having to switch back an forth between AC and Heat (for two zones). So, the most useful (of many) feature is that you can set a range of temps and it will activate the AC or Heat as needed; but, the really great thing is that this thing quickly learns your habits and know about both outdoor and indoor temps, so it learns what to do at various times of day and climate. For the first couple of weeks we dialed in various adjustments, but soon after we realized we weren't adjusting it much at all. Add in that it monitors activity and saves you money when you are away - and I can't think of a more perfect thermostat. This thing s VERY well made - I think of it as the BMW of thermostats. It is excellently crafted in every regard."}

So far I really like the way it performs.\nI have an Insteon thermostat in my primary home. It does not take into account the weather conditions or even monitor the weather. Therefore when you program it for cooler temperatures at night it will try to run the AC even in the winter unless you install safe guards to prevent that. The Nest won't do that in fact it wouldn't allow a test of the AC when I installed it because it said it was too cold to safely run the AC. Very smart.\n\nI'm also impressed with the programming. The web interface you use to access it from a PC is nearly identical to the app you use on your Android phone. Even the thermostat interface is similar so you don't have to think about how to do things depending on what platform your accessing it from like you do with the Insteon thermostat.\n\nSo why only 4 stars?\n1) The 3rd generation Nest has a new feature called Far Sight. In combination with the \"Activate on Approach\" feature it will light up when you get near it and can present you with things like, current temperature, current temperature setting, digital or analogue clocks, the current weather in your town etc. All that is great but if it activates to often the unit begins to get warmer which throws off the temperature sensors. So, if you thermostat is mounted in a high traffic area your house will be cooler than you want as the thermostat will think it's warmer than it is. You can eliminate this issue by switching it to \"Activate on Touch\" mode but then of course you don't get the Far Sight Advantages.\n2) Being new to my house I've been keeping an eye on what it's been doing. I'm not at this house during the week and I was looking for something to keep the house within a temperature range while taking into account the weather conditions so has not to damage my HVAC system or run it needlessly. When I'm away I have it in \"Away\" mode with it set to ECO which will allow it to run the furnace or the AC as needed to keep the house within the temperature range I've set so long as it can do so without damaging the HVAC system. I noticed this morning the temperature was 1 degree cooler then the range. I waited several minutes to see if it would turn on the furnace but it did not. I put it in heat mode and it fired up the furnace immediately. I've only noticed it do that one time but it is something I'll have to keep an eye on."}

I have had my nest for over 6 months with no issues. A couple of days ago though it just randomly dropped WiFi connections. I trouble shot all the webpage solutions with no results. Finally I called Nest support. In about 10 min we walked through all the troubleshooting and without me asking or prompting they said my WiFi card must have burnt out and they are sending me a new one. It\u2019s very rare but like any electric, failures can happen.\n\nI didn\u2019t take a star off because it is still such a great product and they solved the problem and stand behind it.\n\nNow only if they would bring down the cost of their cloud storage for their cameras I\u2019d buy a a few of them. Their cloud camera service is literally 7 times more expensive than a competitor like the Ring, hopefully they read this. Too bad, I\u2019d love to stay with one system but can\u2019t justify the cloud storage cost.

Interface on the Nest and app is super easy to use, and it didn\u2019t take any additional time looking through the manual to learn how to use it. Not sure why people have some of the problems they have had; we haven\u2019t experienced any so far. All I can say is that most of the problems could just be user error."}

I was intending to replace my older Honeywell \u201cdial-type\u201d thermostat, yet found out when I was installing the Nest that the wires weren\u2019t labeled accordingly. After spending quite a bit of time on the phone with Nest Support to try and figure out the wiring, I was instructed by them to have a Nest Pro Installer come out to my home. So much for the \u201ceasy\u201d self install, but I thought the long term benefits of the Nest would make this house call worthwhile. After the Nest \u201cPro\u201d installed the Nest, I noticed an issue (of course, after the Installer left) that the Nest was causing a blower in my furnace to run constantly.\n\nI then proceeded to spend several hours on the phone with Nest Support, and countless trips up and down the stairs to switch wiring around to troubleshoot the issue. The Nest Pro Installer was adamant that the Nest was installed correctly, yet Nest was unwilling to admit it actually MAY be a faulty Nest. I ultimately had to pay for another HVAC technician to come over, and he determined that, YES, the Nest WAS defective! I installed a newer Honeywell thermostat instead, and contacted Amazon for a refund. As always, Amazon was outstanding in issuing a full refund.\n\nUnfortunately, in order to troubleshoot the problem to find out that the Nest WAS DEFECTIVE, I was out $205.00 by having two HVAC technicians make house calls. I asked for this money to be refunded, yet was denied. So, if you unknowingly happen to receive a \u201clemon\u201d Nest, don\u2019t be surprised if this happens to you. I wish I could rate this purchase with negative stars!"}

I had to use hollow wall anchors for the Nest base, but it went on without incident. The wire connection process was a no brainer due to the Nest website and their wiring compatibility section. I made the connections and installed the front of the unit. I had a bad couple of moments when the Nest reported that the R wire had no power.

Oddly enough I hadn't gotten around to it, even though I was interested in the Nest a week after it first hit the market. And then \u2026 my old Honeywell thermostat died - the one I could NEVER fully figure out how to use even after 3 years. (I had to keep consulting the manual anytime I had to make an adjustment; it was that user UN-friendly.) At the same time, Nest had just hit 3rd Generation status, and my Tech Daddy law says \"ALWAYS wait until the 3rd iteration on any new device!\" (Like really.)\n\nSo\u2026 I installed the Nest and have been INSANELY happy with it ever since. It's everything you could want in a thermostat: it's beautiful to look at, easy to read (even for bad vision people like me), exceptionally easy to set up right from the get-go (it was so simple I didn't have to read ANYTHING to do it, although later I did read all the online stuff on how best to use it), and it learns from me! After a month I no longer even have to touch it or access it via my phone, tablet or the web.\n\nIn other words, it delivers on every promise the company makes. It's become one of those \"how did I live without one of these things?!\" kind of device."}

It learns behaviors from outlier data that don't correspond to usual patterns. For example, let's say you're up late, and you want to run the AC an extra hour - that impacts the learned behavior. Do it twice, the Nest thinks it's a pattern and runs your AC every night. Since you're not up to correct that behavior, it assumes it's doing what you want.\n\nI wound up shutting off the AI and programming my own schedule through the app. Much better than what the stupid AI thinks I want it to do, AND saves me more money on my AC in the summers!"}

The main reason for the purchase was the fact that I could monitor and control the heating remotely since this is a cottage in the middle of the woods and the power in the area tends to go out frequently. Since installing the thermostat the power has gone off several times now and the NEST thermostat has not come back online in 2 out of 3 power loss/power restored occurrences.\n\nThankfully, the NEST thermostat continues to function as a thermostat . . . it just can't be monitored or controlled remotely when it is offline. I have no idea if it is in ECO mode or in regular schedule mode and heating the cottage while no one is there.\n\nAs a result of the above issues I need to downgrade the NEST 3rd generation Thermostat to a 2."}

Yes the Nest is expensive (the broken Honeywell would have cost $150 in parts alone, but would have only needed one for a two-zone system), but realizing the energy savings over time (we'll see if it's 10-15% as I read on the Nest website) it should pay for itself soon enough.\nInstallation was a snap - the instructions are really clear, we have a somewhat typical 2-zone, 4-wire low-voltage thermostat system with a red 'common' wire from a house built in the 1970's. Took less than 30 minutes to install two of them, and the white faceplate covered up the unpainted area perfectly.\nLove the ability to remotely set the HVAC onto 'eco' mode, or to turn it up/down from my phone whereever I may be (including in bed late at night or early in the AM).\nBe sure to look into rebates from your electricity or gas supplier, they may offset the cost of installation. (The one offered locally was for $100 off of a professional installation.) However in my case being handy it was definitely an easy-to-do project."}

They installed a Honeywell in its place and it has Wi-Fi fully programmable etc..\n\nI kept the other for my upstairs mancave. It looks cool and easy to use and program. That said, I have had multiple issues with it, going out and losing control. It\u2019s only been 8 months and now I am getting battery failure messages. It goes dead, tells me it has to shut down to recharge, now just a low Battery message so cannot connect to WiFi or my Echo or Nest app or anything (see photos). Apparently the battery in these things is hard wired in so it\u2019s not like popping a cover open and replacing the battery. They may have the software programming down but the hardware is crap.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to spend this much money on a Thermostat it should be reliable and last a long time.\n\nSave yourself some money and for a fraction of the cost buy something from a company that has made Thermostats for decades and reliable!"}

I have been using programmable thermostats for years and I really didn't know if an expensive thermostat would make a big difference. I decided to give it a try when Georgia Power offered $100 off the Nest thermostat, and I'm really glad I did. I have no doubt that it will pay for itself in no time due to the fact that the thermostat can tell when I am away, not just when I'm at work during the day. The phone app is fantastic and I love being able to see the daily usage on it.\nI have only had one minor issue with the thermostat. At one point I noticed that the temperature in the house was not right and I tried to use the app to check it and it said that the thermostat was not connected to WiFi. It turned out that I had received a software update overnight and it drained the battery. Since I don't have a powered line in my furnace setup, apparently it takes a very long time to charge back up. After doing some research I learned that you can plug the unity into a mini USB cord to charge it up faster. Nest should do a better job of informing you of this.\n\nPros: Amazing amount of control via the thermostat itself and the app. The look and feel is fantastic. Cool customization of the display. Easy setup and support if needed. Definitely saving me money on energy.\nCons: Outside of the unusual battery issue detailed above, none."}

My nest cams and all other devices work fine (well the nest cams are not the greatest but they don\u2019t disconnect like the thermostats and I don\u2019t really recommend anything best).\n\nAt one point on the phone tech support said that my nest goes to sleep and stops responding until you physically interact with it and that you can\u2019t wake it with the app. Then someone said that the new generation functions properly through the app but they sent me a new one and it still doesn\u2019t respond properly.\n\nI\u2019ve restarted and reset all settings and even removed all other WiFi devices from my network just to test nest alone and they perform the same. And again I can ping every other device in my home just fine and nest is really the only products that consistently fail.\n\nCustomer service is rude and not intelligent in regards to quality support.

The installation manual is complete, but the operation manual is a joke, and is really only an advertisement for other NEST products. Registration requires a QR code that is on the BACK of the unit. Wish they'd told me that before the technician mounted it on the wall. Once I did find out how to turn the thing on, accessing the SETTINGS menu was complex with many, many unexplained options.

My home central AC was 16-years old, had it replaced and the same company installed the new thermostar for free. I can now control via an app from anywhere or preprogram it to run on a weekly schedule for either heating or cooling. The unit has many great features, but One of the best features, after a while (a week or less) it knows your comfort zone and it automatically adjust itseft, fantastic! Another great feature, updates to the unit are either automatic or can be manually started via a message alert from either the unit itself or the app. It also notifies you of your usage, how many run time hours usage for the month, again fantastic! When setting for cooling or heating, it will also tell you how much time it will take to heat or cool for The tempature you set it for, but that depends on the current home indoor temperature. The unit Also works with the Amazon Echo, Alexa. I have the echo, but have not program it yet to work with Alexa. The unit Also lights up upon passing in front or near it's installed path, displaying the room temperature if you left it programmed to heat or AC. There are many more features to the Nest 3rd gen unit that I have not yet learned like the eco feature or home/away assist or even the schedule mode. I do recommend having the unit installed by a professional or you can call Nest and they can help/walk you through the install. One important thing to no, make sure the existing wires are like a solid single wire simular to telephone wires and not the strand of wire type like in speaker wires because you may burn-out the unit or make it malfunction. Overall, one of the best thermostats you will ever have, but a bit pricy, wait for it to go on sale."}

This nest blew out a control board for our furnace and VOIDED our warranty! We have been in a brand new home for less than 2 weeks and now we have to pay close to a $1000 to fix the control board. Once I purchased the Nest I went through their compatibility widget which told us that it is compatible. I contacted Nest support to see if they could cover the expenses for our furnace. They could not! Then they proceeded to tell me that Nest isn't compatible with out HVAC once I gave them my Furnace information. The only good thing is that they did refund me for $250 AFTER my Amazon return policy ended. Very very disappointed and discouraged, I was really excited about this thermostat and now I'm scared to touch their equipment."}

Early, during that time, I decided to take it off of auto-schedule because it created some bizarre schedules on it's own. The end result of this was that it was no smarter than a $60-$90 smart thermostat, it just cost more. After 18 months it decided that it would not follow it's schedule. It would go into Econ mode, during the week when I left for work, and would not come out of that mode until it detected motion inside the house. The programming was for it to cool or heat 30 minutes before I got home.\nI had 6 phone calls with Nest support. The first 3 were with level 1 support. The latter 3 with level 2 support. The first 3 were about an hour each. The second 3 were about 2 hours each. I was given homework of resetting, reprogramming, and rebooting. Then Nest sent me a replacement and I was tasked with removing the old one, and removing it from the account, and replacing, setup, and reprogramming, as well as mailing the old one back to Nest. I have about 12-13 hours investing in troubleshooting this labor saving device.\nI've asked Nest for either a fix or refund, and they cut contact with me, on Case number 03923464."}

Not, however, exactly as expected... It turns out it doesn't actually do much more than a $30 programmable thermostat. The 'smart' features are vastly overstated. The app is a bit clunky, and is the only way to set the schedule for the unit. I can ask Google about the temperature, and have her turn it up or down, but the problem is it thinks it knows what I want, and keeps fighting me over deviations from its schedule. The design isn't even so great, it doesn't really fit in in a non ultra-modern home. The interface is not intuitive, people are always trying to touch the screen.

I decided I wanted a smart thermostat that would permit me to set temperature ranges for periods of the day when we are in town and have the thermostat cause the HVAC system to do whichever was needed without my intervention. I also wanted my new thermostat to have a separate program for when we are out of town. This program would only need minimum and maximum temperatures for the entire day. I wanted my new thermostat to connect to our WiFi network so we could control it from anywhere. This would allow us to set a higher minimum temperature when we are on our way back home on a cold day so the house would be comfortable when we arrived.\nI thought of this as my wish list and would not have been surprised if there was no device that checked all the boxes. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that the Nest not only checked all those boxes, it had great additional features such as the ability to learn from my temperature adjustments and create a schedule for me.\nI used the online compatibility checking system and had information on where to plug the wires before I even bought my Nest. Installation was REALLY easy and all went well until I tested heating. My Nest started the fan but did not turn on heat. I had mistakenly identified my HVAC system as a heat pump, when in fact it is electric central air coupled to a gas forced-air furnace. When I accurately described my system to the Nest support person she was able to quickly step me through moving on wire and getting my Nest up and running properly.\nThis is a great product backed by great people and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone."}

The Nest provides the ability to quickly and easily set the temperature where you'd like it best. The built in options for consideration of direct sunlight, emergency heat disabling, Eco Mode and sensing me when I walk up to the device are all great things. I have found some slight issues with automatic schedule updates making unwanted modifications, but revisiting the device every few months easily resolves the problem. Overall, the good FAAAR outweighs any issues or \"inconveniences\" of the device. Super simple installation process! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"Author": "MiamiTechnoLawyer", "Date": "on October 28, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Worth Every Penny", "Text": "Nest 3 is an amazing device. For $130.00 more than a \"dumb thermostat\" you get amazing design, remote monitoring of your home for temperature and humidity, and you will recover your investment in Nest in a year or two depending on the size of your home. We had a programmable thermostat before Nest that had the worst possible interface. Sometimes programming errors would have us arriving home to a hot house that we did not ask for. Nest uses the location of your cell phone and a motion sensor to know when you are home. It learns your habits and reduces energy consumption (cools less in summer) when your home is empty. For anyone with more than one home or doing Air BnB or VRBO a Nest will allow you to monitor your vacation home when you are not there and adjust the temperature after guest leaves. I should have bought this ages ago."}

I plan to use this with my Amazon echo but have not had a chance to try it out yet but based on the reviews it sounds like I should not have any issues."}

I have purchased and installed 2 of these, one upstairs and one on main floor and I regret it. I fell for the hype, don't make the same mistake. First off- the Home/Away assist feature which is supposed to use your smart phone and/or sensors on the thermostat to determine you aren't home is extremely unreliable. It works about %25 of the time, so there goes that savings. This is after I set it up to only use cell phone location to determine if I'm away, no dice.\nSecond issue: humidistat is wildly inaccurate. I'm using this turd to control an Aprilaire 700m and the humidity reading drops around 3% whenever the furnace kicks on, and it will never get above%30 humidity on the display. I'm confident it is completely wrong, so I need to order a separate humidistat to 'calibrate' this thing. Tried to get tech support to help on this one but because a 'Nest Pro' didn't do the install, they wouldn't help, so that's issue#3. Problem is that the HVAC guys that I use and that installed the furnace in my new house will not touch Nest products. They hate dealing with them, apparently because of the multitude of issues with them just like I'm experiencing here, so I'm on my own with troubleshooting.\nFourth issue:. 1 year into ownership now and both thermostats will randomly show disconnected on the app. Both the phone and the thermostats are connected to home network during this. I truly hate this product. Tech support is quite literally worthless. Good luck and get used to a giant headache if you go this route."}

One thing for sure is that NEST Technicians/Customer Service is there to help no matter how long it takes and the IQ of the homeowner/installer. The NEST website is also a huge benefit and is able to guide you through the majority of the setup, of course there appears to always be a hiccup here and there so it was great to be able to call in and get the problem solved. My setup was for a Heat Pump which is always more difficult to understand and setup. ....highly recommend the NEST Thermostat."}

Turns out it must have been a restock because all of the original packaging was intact, even the plastic tabs on the box and the Nest unit itself. Score!\nIt was an easy enough install. I watched the video beforehand and then I went to task on my old thermostat. I followed the instructions which were fairly easy. My only issue seemed to be that the preexisting wiring was where I was drilling the holes for the Nest. The previous thermostat\u2019s screws were aligned horizontally while the Nest has them aligned vertically. I hope I didn\u2019t fray anything back there. I used the back plate because I wasn\u2019t sure I had the right paint color to touch up the white wall were my Nest is now installed. It doesn\u2019t really bother me but if it comes to it, I\u2019ll go hunt for the paint. So far it works great. The app is really easy to use. I can turn it on when I\u2019m not home, which is a great feature. My dog is really grateful for that. It tells me how much usage I\u2019ve accrued and I can schedule when to run my cooling or heating. It also has an ECO function which is a range of where I\u2019d like my home temperature to be.

With install guide in hand they were very straightforward to configure (the electrician and HVAC guys were intimidated). They work exactly as you want. Easy to schedule; the display is VERY nice with a lot of information; I love seeing how long until our house will reach the temp selected; I love the green leaf showing me energy conscious settings and teaching me easy changes to form better habits; I really like seeing outside temp v I side temp. I find it easy to use/change. I like that it lights when I go past at night (my new friendly nightlite) when prowling around in the dark. Completely worth the money; makes other smart thermostats look clunky. Also I actually like the app, which doesn\u2019t have a good rating - not sure why. I sent app invite to hubby and we can both keep track of the temp and adjust if our family decides to stay out longer than anticipated. Straightforward to use and does everything it should.

For a fraction of the price, a programmable thermostat will do the most important thing -- keep your house as warm or as cool as you desire, on days and at times that you choose. That said, I love it anyway because it's a terrific piece of technology and looks good as well. It uses a Bluetooth signal from your phone to know whether you are home or not, and if you're not, it can lower the heat or turn down the air conditioning, thereby saving money. How cool is that?! It uses WiFi to show you the current weather, as well as allowing you to control it remotely with your cell phone. An extravagance perhaps, but a clever one."}

I purchased the nest and installed it as soon as it came in. Installation was easy and getting it connected to my Amazon Echo was simple. I was happy to see that the nest is reading the correct temperature. I have my nest set to heat/cool and when I walk by it shows me the temperature setting. If I was closer to it it shows me a dial image and what the temperature currently is in my living room. I haven't done much with the learning portion. I usually set a temperature and forget about it.

However, after installing the Nest, we started to see strange behavior, like the heat never turning off. I was on the phone with Nest for hours diagnosing the problem to no avail. We had an HVAC tech come and look at it, and he couldn't figure it out. We got a replacement from Nest that had the same problem. We even had a Nest Pro come by to take a look, and he couldn't figure it out. We ended up getting a third replacement, and that didn't function either. It's possible there's a problem with our HVAC unit, but I find it hard to believe that no tech was able to identify what that problem was or how to fix it, and a regular thermostat works just fine with it. The only conclusion I can draw is the Nest is doing something weird with my particular HVAC package unit, but Nest is unable to figure out what that is. Since I bought Nest to *save* time and attention, I was unhappy that I had to spend so much on it. Since it's past the return date, I'm planning on selling mine.\n\nI'm sure Nest will probably work for most people; the interface and app are great, and it works great as a smart thermostat when it does work. But beware of it not working. It's possible the problem will be entirely opaque and will eat up a lot of your time and attention."}

Once we moved in, we had seen that our thermostat was a very basic non programmable thermostat. After looking around and reading comments about other products, I finally decided to purchase my nest. I was very hesitant on the price because it's a lot, but very happy I did. Installation went very well, even with a hiccup and contacting support. I removed my old thermostat cover and used the compatible checker to make sure my wires were compatible. I had a 5 wire system, just a furnace and ac. After taking pics of my old thermostat wire setup and labeling the wires, I used the white plate to cover my old holes and screwed the base plate down over the cover after using the built in level to make sure it was level. Once I placed my nest onto the base nothing happened.. I waited 5 mins and power cycled my breaker for my furnace and ac a few times. After which I contacted support, I was pleasantly surprised that my call was answered within 1-2 minutes and I was greeted by an American. After talking to the agent, it was decided to plug my nest unit into a micro USB cable to try to power the nest on to see if I had a defective unit. After putting the nest on my charger, the unit came to life. I placed the unit onto the base plate and went through the initial configuration. The nest did a self diagnosis to find out which services are installed, the nest found an issue with my red power wire that went to the rh terminal on my old unit. I made sure I had enough wire stripped back and it was placed all the way into the wire holder. The agent got me to troubleshoot a little and we moved the red power wire from rh to rc, same issue occurred. On the rh terminal I got error 74, on rc I had error 73. The agent had me turn my furnace and ac breakers off every time I had to move a wire or make a change. He had me remove the blue wire that was connected to the \"C\" terminal after which my voltages on my nest went from about 2 volts up to 40 volts. There was an issue with my 24V common blue wire on my brand new furnace system. I have not had a single issue after removing the blue C wire and I am extremely pleased with the professionalism and fast service I received by calling into nest. They've earned a customer for life and I will definitely be purchasing more products."}

Now it won't connect, and of course this happens when you are half way across the country. Restarted my router remotely; now neither thermostat is connecting, nor is camera connecting. Lovely! Needs a lot of improvement; I get so tired of calling support and troubleshooting their equipment!!!!!!!!!! while wasting my time.\n\nUpdate: the restart problem above had to do with our Ooma Telo, not the thermostats. The real problem with these is the schedule you set up. We returned from a trip today and the temperature outside was in the low 40's and in 20's last night, but the termperature inside was in the low 50's despite a Nest schedule which specified they should be set to 60. Took hours to get the radiant heat back up to warm the house! Checked the schedule and it was totally different from what I had set up. Temperatures of 51 degrees had been entered on several days in the middle of my original schedule. The power had gone off, so I don't know if that did anything to the schedule, but we have a generator that seconds later turned the power on if it was in fact anything other than a surge or momentary power loss. We have to have reliable heat in Maine in the winter; now I'll have to check the Nest schedule daily to make sure it hasn't changed itself. This is unacceptable!!!"}

{"Author": "Zulu", "Date": "on October 10, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Looks can be Deceiving (and usually are?)", "Text": "I have owned and used the Nest from Generation 1. Here is my experience. I am an engineer used to process control devices and heating and ventilating design and implementation. I have used this with a forced air system and with a radiant or in-floor system.\n1. This device is attractive, without detracting from the looks of wall where it is mounted - it is modern and has an attractive display which only lights when it needs to.\n2.As an on/off controller it works the same as the very old style mechanical switch - does the job. As an \"intelligent\" controller (i.e. making use of the embedded computer to provide better control than on/off control) it is poor. At most it implements the basic feed-back control so-called \"proportional control\" or P control while industrial controllers have for many years implemented proportional, integral and differential (PID) feedback control - gives much superior control allowing system to reach the set-point quicker and maintaining them without overuse of energy. Discussing this with Nest they said that their server based software implemented their version of PID feed-back control and also feed-forward control (learns how long your controller takes to achieve objectives) - which Nest call \"thermostat learning\". Testing with my thermostat shows that this in NOT the case; at best they are implementing P feedback control only. There is no OID and there is no feed-forward control of any type. They sometimes justify the connection to their server as being required for you to get learning control for the Nest. This need not be true - the computer within the Nest could be designed to give local PID control - check on the internet for arduino based PID controls and see both their size and cost compared to the Nest if you want to see my point about what Nest could be.\n3. They provide an App to monitor and change the thermostat set-point. This can be useful if one is away for long enough (say 2 hrs minimum) since starting and stopping a heating system is in itself inefficient and should be minimized. But from a owner privacy point of view this can be implemented though a dedicated end-to-end encrypted message via their servers (like Whatapp used to do before being bought by Facebook). No data to Nest since the data is not required to get the app to function.\n4. Summary. Too much of the design and implementation of the Nest thermostat (but also their other products) is about Nest (and Google) collecting your data and their business of selling your data to make money (read their Privacy Policy, strip away the promises that can never be supported and focus on who they can legally sell the data to. Too little is about giving solutions to the owner of the device in exchange for this data and the cost of the device. Example above PID could be implemented locally without connection to server. Since they do not even implement it at the server level (it has been doing in an industrial environment but requires hardware and expertise i.e. costs money) it is clear that the reason for its existence in the Nest world is to justify the collection of data, it has never been intended to provide something to the owner. There are other options out there that provide better control (proven track record of implementing PID control) and privacy (businesses that don't have the selling of information as their sole source of revenue). One, but there are others, Honeywell, has been producing PID controllers for industry for many years. They just need to be encouraged to provide more attractive designs!"}

Per our serial number we had a 2nd generation. Amazon was helpful enough to refund our money. However, we actually preferred a replacement and was told they could not guarantee we would receive what we ordered (what it was advertised as). Ummm....really??? Ok...that made no sense. So we took the refund and purchased the 3rd generation Nest at Home Depot.\nBuyer beware...make sure, if you decide to purchase one of these from Amazon, you check the serial number. Serial numbers beginning with \u201c02\u201d are a second generation. Serial numbers beginning with \u201c09\u201d are a 3rd generation.\nI want to add that I used the thermostat received for about 2 weeks and it worked fine and looked very nice on our home.

Eventually, I've figured it out, but it took some time. So if you're in the same position, take this hint: if your wiring was C&R for the 24V power and 0/B&Rc for the heater trigger, then in the Nest thermostat you need C&Rc for the power, and W1&Rh for the heater (see the screenshot)."}

Some of the functions, including the phone app, are very useful, but it falls short in certain areas in which you cannot change what the thermostat does or comes hardwired with.\nWe don't use the auto scheduling; there is no chance that it works with our changing schedules + we have it on a corridor where it cannot accurately detect who's in the house.\nA couple of annoying features: when you sent heat+cool, there is a minimum 3-degree difference between the two, so if you set heating at 73 degrees, cooling cannot start below 76, unless you change it manually--but what's the point of having a smart thermostat? With babies, that's not helpful. Other thermostats allow you to set cooling at +1 degree from heating, which is what you need in certain cases if you don't mind spending a bit more on the energy bill.\nThe second feature that is problematic is that there is only one manual schedule and it takes some time to set up. Once you figure it out, you cannot easily bypass it to set the thermostat at a fixed temperature. Say you have visitors and want to keep the house at the same temperature all day, you have to delete the entire schedule and set it up again once they leave. Other thermostats allow for a \"permanent hold\" feature, which bypasses the scheduling until you put it back on scheduling.\nAll in all, it seem like a great gadget, but in certain non-trivial areas it falls short relative to more basic thermostats that cost a lot less."}

BUT my old one basically did the same thing, and honestly, I think it kept the temperature more consistent than this one. Sometimes, with the Nest, a 73 will feel hot, but the next day a 76 will feel quite cold. I haven't noticed any savings in our power bill, but Nest insists on telling me I'm \"more Eco-friendly than 87% of the Nest-users around you\" in emails. Who really knows. The Home-Away assist thing functions sometimes, but not all the time. That could be because my Motorola Moto X sometimes reports me at home when I'm really not, so I couldn't fairly dock a star for that. The \"Airwave\" feature just runs your fan to circulate the air without the A/C running, which I actually love, and I wish it would turn on more frequently. Other than that, this is a thermostat.

What I didn't take into consideration was my blatant disregard for reading instructions and using only my prior experience to guide me, which was a huge mistake. When you go to do the install, make sure you turn off the breakers to all related HVAC components (or better yet, to the entire house). I did not do either. When I pulled the old thermostat off, I manually kept the wires apart, but at some point, I crossed two wires and that shorted out the furnace. I completed the install as though nothing happened, and then I kept getting an error message from the Nest which made no sense, as I had all the wires connected correctly. After a couple hours of tinkering, I finally broke down and called Nest tech support. The representative was able to diagnose the problem, which was that I had shorted the furnace circuit, most likely when the wires crossed. He gave me the option to have a Nest Pro come out and fix it which would cost me a bit, or I could do it myself by replacing the $5 fuse. I opted for the latter option, went to Home Depot and got the replacement fuse, plugged it in, and voila, everything works beautifully now. The important part of this review is to make sure you follow the directions completely."}

Setup and general use is a breeze. But it's the \"intelligence\" that it claims to have that is the problem. I will keep this concise as possible.\n\nThe Away from home feature is not useful. I would go into my back yard and it thinks I am gone, so it would put the temperature into eco mode. There should be a smarter proximity - it should know that I am within a certain range. I don't want to be outside in 100 degree temps and walk into a 79 degree house.\n\nAuto programming did not work well for me. This again had to do with proximity. My electricity bill is a thing of comfort and convenience. I want to have a comfortable house when I get home. I feel this thermostat tries to save the most energy, even by maximizing how much it doesn't run. I do not care about \"how many leaves\" I saved during the week (this is in the weekly email). Programming a thermostat is enough to conserve a substantial amount of energy while also maintaining comfort. So another feature that didn't work for me.\n\nThe fan controls are RIDICULOUS. Are you reading this Nest? YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THIS. The fan cannot be turned on indefinitely. Did you know the fan draws as much energy as a standard lightbulb? What if we had a water leak and want the fan to run all day to vent the house? Nope, cannot do it. What if you have an AC problem where you can't run the cooling cycle, but want to run the fan to circulate the air? Guess what, to turn off the cooling cycle, you either have to turn it to Off or put in Eco mode. But you can't run the fan in either cycle. The fan only can run during cool or heat mode. THIS IS A JOKE! I should be able to manually control the fan if I want to. It's my fan!\n\nAnd you better hope you don't have a problem with one. This is where I was COMPLETELY LET DOWN. I have two units, one upstairs and one down. The downstairs unit one day said it lost internet connectivity. Hmmm, ok, nothing change on my network. So I soft reset it. Not resolved. Ok, so I do a factory reset. Granted, I learned these two by reading the Nest site for troubleshooting tips. Nope, hard reset did not work.\n\nWell, after this the screen doesn't come on and there is a red light on it. So I take it off the wall and plug into a USB charger thinking something is wrong with the battery.\n\nI end up calling Nest and the tech person has me start troubleshooting my router. Hmmm, the other unit is fine. But he wants to measure ping time. I am in tech, so I question why this important. Answer was \"it could be pinging too much and draining down the battery.\" I reminded him that it is hard wired, so he asks me to get a voltage meter.\n\nYes, a voltage meter. Guess what, the voltage is on a system screen in settings.\n\nI also mention to him that I have taken the unit off and charged it, so we can see what the voltage is. There is where it gets fun. The next 45 minutes consist of me running back and forth between upstairs and downstairs, changing out each unit to see how they are working and reading the voltage. I ask him if it is possible the battery is bad - he replies he has never seen a battery die in one. I did not believe this. I had to measure the drop in voltage between the units and prove to him the downstairs was keeping a charge, although it had good power in.\n\nHe also informed me that the Wifi will turn off if the battery power drops too low. Oh, it does? Was I notified of this? If Nest is SO SMART why didn't I get an alert that it went offline due to a drop in voltage and to call customer service? Why didn't it log the power information at Nest for me so when I called they could see what happened? And how come this SMART unit cannot self diagnose the battery is going bad?\n\nThose are not hard things to do, but it took me 1.5 hours to resolve my issue, only to learn the battery was bad. Oh, and the best part. Nest will not work at all when the battery is dead, so I had no thermostat. I had to drive to the store, buy another temporary thermostat and wire it.\n\nOverall, I would not buy or recommend this unit to anyone. The only thing I get out of this is a cool looking unit with a good app and easy scheduling. There are other options that are cheaper.\n\nAs a result of my experience, I will not be buying a Nest Cam, though I had planned on it. I am uncertain they are worth the cost and am very concerned about having an issue that requires me to call support."}

Finally, the ease of integration with other smart devices via several communication platforms, including IFTTT if all else fails, is wonderful.\n\nIn the few weeks I've had and used it, it has performed exceedingly well, and been nothing but a the nicest addition to my home so far!\n\nIf you're thinking about buying a nest thermostat, ask yourself what you are doing it for. Just by itself, it's amazingly convenient but can be hard to justify based on price. However, if you're considering adding it to an existing or in progress home automation initiative, you will reap greater benefits. In such a case, it's tough to find a competitor that can hold a candle to this thermostat's usability and ease of use."}

I called and the support team was overwhelmingly helpful. Five minutes later I had a diagram e-mailed to me and a contract e-mail if I needed anything. As I opened the box my heart sank a little. There was a pin head size chip in the finish on the outer ring. I had waited this long and was not going to let this slow me down. I installed the nest thermostat, entered my WiFi info, set it up and downloaded the Nest App. on my phone in about twenty minutes. Easy! I sent an e-mail about the minor flaw and didn't really expect anything to happen. The unbelievable service this company provides is amazing! They contacted me right away. They explained that any flaw is highly irregular and they were sending me a new control unit. The new control unit showed up and I exchanged it. It took about five minutes. The entire experience has been so awesome! Such a great company and the flexibility of this thermostat is exactly what I had hoped for. The App. work with it flawlessly and I am completely satisfied!

This thing has saved me so much money. My power bills are consistently never over $60 even after running the AC while I'm home in the evenings and overnight. If your schedule is pretty regular, I would recommend using an app/site called IFTTT. It uses my phones GPS to set the NEST automatically. As soon as I leave for work, the Nest shuts off, and stays off I leave work to come home. This saves so much energy! I think they have similar functionality bit into they app, but I like the fact that as soon as I leave work, the AC kicks on. It's nice to walk into a cool house, or at least get it started by the time I arrive. I'll be replacing my smoke detectors with Nest Protects as well. Don't forget to check for rebates! AEP here in Ohio gave me a check for $75 for replacing my old thermostat for the Nest.\n\nI do have one complaint. I really wish they would add Apple HomeKit support. I know this is an Apple Vs Google issue, but they should think of their customers. I have had an iPhone since they were first released. I'm not going to switch to Android because my iPhone doesn't support my thermostat. It's making me think about switching to Ecobee who does support HomeKit."}

Installation was very straight-forward and simple; the online video is a great help, too. Programming/Learning and tweaking it took a little getting used to (the first night, I woke up hot because it adjusted the temp because it sensed no one was home). But, learning new technology to customize to one's preferences does require a learning curve; I've now gotten it set-up exactly as I wanted. The Home/Away Assist sensor on the thermostat is super sensitive; my ceiling fans were causing it to think someone was home even though I/my phone was physically miles away from home. So, the Tech Support chat advisor had me disable the occupancy sensor on the thermostat (through the app), and that fixed the issue. I can already tell my system is working less (while still keeping me very comfortable) and am looking forward to reduced power bills for the foreseeable future."}

Uses MORE energy than a standard thermostat.", "Text": " I've had many issues with this thermostat. The thermostat is supposed to save you money. That was the main reason we purchased it. The Nest thermostat has actually cost us hundreds. We have had it around a year and a half. The main issues I've had are -\n\n#1. It doesn't work correctly. This device has many critical issues with no resolutions. I have personally spent hours on hold with Nest phone support line. After troubleshooting, they just tell you that it is your system and to call a HVAC specialist. My home was built in 2005 and my A/C and Furnace were replaced less than 6 months ago. My issue is when the Nest tries to run the A/C. The unit outside will run properly, but the fan inside the home will turn on/off repeatedly then just stay off. So the outdoor unit could run for hours with no air moving inside of the home. I replaced the nest with the still operational thermostat that was installed when the house was built. The issue no longer exists.\n\n#2 It's power saving features are annoying as hell. I work nights and I am home sleeping during early morning/day. If no one walks by the thermostat for a little while, it will think no one is home and turn off. Many times I am laying on the couch watching TV and the house gets hot. I check the app and my thermostat is set to away mode and has crept up to 82. I cant tell you how frustrating it is to wake up in a sweat during the limited sleep I actually get because the Nest thinks no one is home. I had to turn these features off, so basically it is a very attractive, semi-working, money sucking device that you can control via an app on your phone."}

My wife and I recently purchased our new home and the first \"modification\" to the house was to replace the thermostat in the home. I purchased two NEST Thermostats, one for upstairs and one downstairs.\n\nInstallation:\nThis was the easiest electronic install ever! NEST makes it dummy proof. And if you are still having trouble following the directions, there are plenty of videos on youtube on how to install one. It really is a piece of cake!\n\nUse:\nBasically... you turn the ring to the desired temperature and you're done! No need to set schedules either. Nest Thermostat learns how you like your home and it continues to learn and set temperatures the more you use it. Combine that with the app on your phone, and you can adjust your temperature before you arrive your house. Power of a connected home!\n\nThe one thing that really surprised me was AirWave.\n<snippet from Nest> After your air conditioner turns off, it stays cold for five to ten minutes, just like ice cream stays cold after it comes out of the freezer. Other thermostats ignore this simple fact, but Nest uses it to your advantage. Airwave shortens the amount of time the high-energy chiller runs and instead uses your energy-efficient fan to push that extra cool air through the home. Nest automatically enables Airwave when the temperature is high and the humidity is low. Airwave can save up to 30 percent of the energy used and the user doesn\u2019t have to lift a finger."}

I remove my Nest from my home security system interface and hope the issue is fixed.\n*Wake up next morning, watch my Nest power on and off at random for 10 minutes straight*\nCall 3: Talk to some clown who has me power the Nest off and on, and then tells me to \"monitor it and call them back if it keeps happening\". I tell him that at $250 a pop, this is BS and I want a new unit. His response \"monitor and call back\".\n\nNest, this is unacceptable.

Purchased in December 2016, the first time we had an issue was in late May 2017. The error message stated that there was no power to the Rh. The air conditioning setting had been on, but rather than just shutting off, it began to heat the house instead (it was a 90 degree day in May). Fortunately for my dog, we came home in time to discover the issue. Given the temperature of the house, it had been heating for at least an hour. Tech support was very nice and after all kinds of wire switching found that I had hit the \"trifecta\" of problems and the thermostat had to be replaced. Fortunately for us, they overnighted a new thermostat, I re-installed it and all was well. Until two weeks ago when the same thing happened all over again. Unfortunately for us, the tech person who was \"helping\" me clearly did not know what they were doing and simply was reading whatever literature she had in front of her. I was escalated to a supervisor who indicated that it must be a problem with my system since the thermostat simply uses power to turn on and off and adjust the temperature as told. Ultimately, they agreed to send me a refund for the thermostat because this was my second go-around with significant issues (I have not yet received the refund, so perhaps I'm being overly positive that the experience will go as planned). As I said in the beginning, I did like the thermostat and its features, it's just completely unreliable. To prove my point, I went out and purchased a different brand of wireless thermostat which had me up and running in less than 10 minutes. Clearly my system was not the issue."}

{"Author": "Jason P. Walters", "Date": "on August 25, 2017", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great product, online site needs some modernization.", "Text": "Nest is a great product. It was way ahead of the competition, but I think over time they somewhat stagnated, probably because of the Google acquisition. But my real beef is not with the product but the online services and product positioning. So, I upgraded both of my old Nests to the Gen 3 product. In Nest's mind every person is a thermostat, and upgrading is not a valid use case. There is no upgrade/migration path in your online account. Every 'stat is treated like a new one. There is no ability to migrate your scheduling for winter (heat) or summer (cooling) across a new thermostat. That can impose a lot of time on someone to re-create. There is no ability to replicate settings across multiple thermostats. I had to set up the new ones from scratch and then delete the ones I replaced from the account. There were also a lot of wrinkles. I had to remember to zap the firmware's of the old ones first. I didn't in one case... I actually had to rewire it up to zap it. Would be great if there was a document that described some steps for a smooth upgrade. Right now Nest is more concerned about the \"new\" customer experience, with bedazzling boxes, and QR codes. I get that more people have not seen the nest than have, but it seems like every box is positioned as a new home/customer and we all get shoe-horned into that process. Look, the product has been out for a good 5 years or so now. It's 2017, and the business model and experience hasn't been upgraded."}

This white Nest learning thermostat is the 1st of 3 thermostats I'm upgrading and I'm very happy with it so far, but there are specifics that need to be mentioned.\n\nThe 1st Nest thermostat I received from Amazon was defective. During installation and near the end of setup the thermostat detected a wire connected to the Y2 terminal (which there was not one). After looking high and low on the internet for any similar issues and finding non at all (I can only assume this means it's a rare issue), I called Nest tech support. They concluded the device was defective and gave me the option of using up the warranty or returning it for a replacement through Amazon. Obviously it was best (and faster) to replace through Amazon.\n\nOne thing that really bothered me---since the device thought there was a wiring issue, I could not finish setup. But, you must finish setup to remove your personal information that was entered at the beginning of the setup process (wi-fi password and SSID for example) and reset the device. There is absolutely no way to remove your info in the event of a setup error such as mine.\n\nThe replacement device works great and I really like the white version. I've heard the stainless steel version gets finger prints and smudges very easily. The white matches all of the trim in my home and it looks fantastic. I did use the wall plate to cover a hole that was previously hidden by my old thermostat. The wall plate looks great though and with the inclusion of a built in level, a metal back plate (if needed), wire labels, and magnetic screwdriver, it shows all the thought Nest has put into making installation easy for anyone. It works seemlessly with Alexa and the devices display is customizable and gorgeous."}

I also like that it takes up so little room on our wall and you can see the temperature from across the room."}

The Nest does not cool to the temperature you set for HOURS. Literally hours. It's currently 80 degrees in my apartment and it will not cool down. The crazy thing is, this is all by design!!!! The Nest does \"eco\" cooling to save energy, but it makes the user's life miserable. There should be an option for blast cooling, but the Nest is more concerned about energy efficiency than being a useable product. I'm changing back to my old thermostat tomorrow."}

The \"Works with Alexa\" tag doesn't help as the items themselves are often in conflict with the user comments. Where one lock is advertised as working with Wink Hub 2, Smart Things and maybe one other hub, there are user comments that say, \"No. Use Vera 3 or some other z-wave hub.\nI recognize Z-wave is supposed to more secure than Wi-Fi and Bluetooth but, really!

If you want to be 100% sure of compatibility, remove the casing of your old thermostat & take some pictures of it. Then go to the Nest website and chat with an agent. You can send them the pictures and the will confirm which models would work with your domicile's wiring and email you a PDF of the instructions to use.\n3/5 Software/ Networking The only issue I have with this device is trying to get it to connect to the internet. It works fine if you have a home with your own network that you control, but if you live in an apartment which has central wifi controlled by a password it is a huge pain to get to connect. With out being connected you will lose a lot of the advanced features, including the novel temperature control app. The software/GUI on the device is great and easy to use, the App for Android is great and easy to use, getting the Nest to connect to a network was a huge pain.\n5/5 Does what is was supposed to do, controls the temperature effectively and efficiently.

Thats why we gave it 4 not 5 stars. We punched in our wiring diagram info from the old system and the website gave us a possible wiring diagram. My husband is computer and tech savvy but we ended up having to use a NEST PRO, for the instal. The issue was that the wires used in our old Thermostat were not common colors so he (the PRO) simply ended up switching the white/brown wires around and Tada! we had a working AC blowing out cool air. Where we live (CA) we don't really use the Heat part of our system because the outside/inside temp in the winter are bearable but testing the unit (NEST) is a bit misleading and takes time because of the safety features built in (they don't want to wear out your thermostat) to prevent any damage to the thermostat, something we appreciated... Over all if your wiring is not EXACTLY the same as the options you choose in the #compatibilityChecker use the PRO INSTALL option!!!"}

I leave at 7:15AM everyday, and I prefer to open the windows to let the fresh air in during the daytime, so I want to automatically and completely turn the AC off at 7AM. This simple function can not be achieved by NEST 3rd generation. In the schedule, you can only set the cooling temperature to 90F (highest you can adjust). You can't set it to OFF or use some very high temperature like 110F or even use the ECO temperature in the schedule. It is very stupid and I have to manually shut off the unit every morning like what I was doing before buying NEST. In addition, it is time consuming to shut off the AC with the unit. You have to go to settings and find the mode then choose to shut it off. It will take 30 seconds with NEST but just 1 second with my old unit, because the old unit has a switch. However, it would be easier to use NEST app to turn the AC off. Please do not recommend the AWAY function. I do not want the unit to sense if I am away or not. I just want it to automatically turn off the AC at 7AM sharp. I contacted the NEST customer support, and they admit that NEST just can't do it. It is already 3rd generation, but it could not do this simple job, very frustrating. I regret to invest this thermostat."}

So I end up changing the temp manually all the time. honestly a big reason why we will keep it is aesthetics; we like the look and the display."}

The geofencing feature which puts the thermostat in away/home mode based on your phone location was removed. It now waits hours to detect no motion at the thermostat to set it to away (Eco mode). There is no vacation mode to tell it you are away and there is no temperature hold feature to tell it you are home. These are basic features that are missing and available on all other smart thermostats. The learning feature was broken in a software update over a year ago and is still not working correctly. I have called Nest support several times in the past 2 years since I purchased the thermostat and all they ever say is that they are working on the software problems and promise more features soon. I would not recommend the Nest thermostat, especially at its high price point. There are many better smart thermostats to choose from (Ecobee, Honeywell, ...)."}

I purchased to install on my Lennox furnace / air conditioner. Have friends that love their Nest's, and wanted to get started with the Nest universe of products. Purchased, opened, installed and found it was not compatible. My Lennox has a continuously variable fan, that I love, and the Nest will not work with it. I started to questions the Nest after the testing of the fan, turned it on but would not speed up the fan (it barely blew any air). After much Googling of Nest website, buried deep on the website was a note about continuously variable furnaces, and the fact Nest 3rd did not work. So, here is what you need to know. If you have a single stage, dual stage, or three stage (1,2 or 3 speed fan) furnace this will work. If you have a high tech continuously variable fan your out of luck. Once you go to a furnace with continuously variable, you will never go back. You hardly know your furnace is running as it can ramp up and down to the perfect heating and cooling fan speed. So, hope Nest will update their thermostat some day to work with this style of fan. Hey Nest, how about a remote thermostat like Ecobee?"}

Heat pumps have two wires that normal gas heat has which is one for auxiliary and one for emergency heat. Once I figured out the colors and got that part installed the setup was so simple! Looks great on the wall and love that it senses you walking up to it and it atuomaticlly displays very bright.\n\nI have a Honeywell touch screen programmable thermostat form my main level and it had better instructions on how to hook the wires up for every type of system but I still like the nest better as far as the options go. I have a carrier one that came with my carrier and honestly like that one better than all of them but by itself it's like a 400.00 thermostat, but when you buy a 10k carrier unit it's included. But the nest really is nice and if any of the others mess up I will choose a nest.\n\nEDIT from 5 star to 1:\nOk so summer time is right around the corner so I thought i would test my basement system out. Apparently the heat part of the thermostat runs my heat just fine. BUT it does not switch-over my heat pump to Air conditioning, SAD!. I thought at first my air system has failed it is 10 years old after all. So with process of elimination I hooked up my old thermostat that came with my HVAC to see if maybe the nest was not working. Hooked the old plain stat up and the air switches on and ice cold air blows YAY not my system!!.\n\nSo i go to the nest website and there are about 8 or so different connection options for Heat Pumps (Now in case you don't know a heat pump is electric heat with no gas, does not mean its only heat), their connections are just way to complicated with little explanation!!!!. I tried every option using the two that made the most sense first and matched those. Nothing would switch the air on. With my old stat attached it will cut the air on and you can actually hear a different sound in the air handler which indicated to me its doing something different that the nest is not doing to the air handler. So its either is not compatible with my Amana system or it takes a professional to install it???? ridiculous! Or it went bad? When i bought the nest it was not the dead of summer so i really have only ran heat. Maybe it got surged?\n\nSo i ordered another Honeywell like my upstairs which runs another similar system i have that i know works model number RTH9580WF1005. I recommend the Honeywell over the nest for heat pumps its simpler to connect. The interface on the Honeywell I love hands down better after owning both for more than 6 months I tell you now the Honeywell not only has a better display but it works with heat pumps.\n\nNow if you have a conventional system like most you'll probably have good luck."}

Two suggestions when installing: 1) make sure you take a picture of your old thermostat's wiring before you begin. This will save you a headache a few minutes down the road. 2) be sure to flip your breaker off for the AC before you begin. An AC professional told me you can actually fry your existing system if some of those wires touch one another. Easy way around that is flipping the AC breaker off at the electrical panel and turning it back on when the install is complete."}

Very easy to install - but recommend watching the video a couple of times and then following the instructions exactly.

I wish Nest would get into more WiFi products like water sensors; wall outlets, light switches. \"Most\" of the other products being sold under \"connected\" require a hub and usually they are proprietary (meaning you have to buy something else from the same company to make it work). I love the self-tests which you can perform on the Nest Learning Thermostat. You will know if it works or not by the tests.

I have gone on to purchase their smoke detector and camera.\n\nOne flaw - If you have more than two different houses you want to monitor you have to set up multiple profiles. I pray that they see the light and add more than 2 homes per profile. There is no good reason to restrict this."}

It works with Alexa, and was an upgrade to my existing programmable thermostat(s). I am in the process of home automation and when my energy company offered these thermostats as an upgrade to the home manager efficiency plan I was already on, I jumped at the chance to install these. I was already researching wifi/smart learning thermostats at the time on Amazon to upgrade my home automation through the integration of Alexa. The nest fits right in! It's design is sleek and simple and very user friendly! Set up was simple enough, through the nest app. I would definitely recommend this thermostat to family and friends!"}

It's too early to review it's features and performance, but the fit and finish of the thermostat is high quality. The experience is similar to getting a new iphone. The packaging is high end and the instructions well written. I waited a long time before purchasing this product. The price point was just too high. With Nest offering the unit for $199 and ComEd, my electric company providing an instant rebate at 50%, $100 seemed like a fair price."}

Excited to see how it performs once we turn the furnace on this Fall/Winter."}

I learns how we want our house heated and cooled and I don't have to create programs - - - unless I want to."}

We have tried reconnecting with our SSID and password, followed all the troubleshooting steps.\n\nYesterday I spent nearly two hours on the phone with the NEST customer service. Rude, unprofessional, and callous. Three times (I called five times in my attempt to find somone who would hel) I asked to speak with a supervisor; twice I the NEST representative placed me on hold for several minutes before disconnecting me.\n\nWhen I finally reached a supervisor, he had no knowledge of my problem and the records did not show my previous calls, even though every NEST customer service representative asked me several times for the email address associated with our account so that they could 'update the record.'\n\nOur NEST does not operate, and no one at NEST will help.\nWe are not stupid, as inferred by one of the NEST customer representatives."}
