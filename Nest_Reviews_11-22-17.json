Last update turned the app useless for both indoor and outdoor cameras. Both timelines say no events, and you can't scroll to view the video because the display cuts out when you scroll. I also have purchased nest aware  for both cameras, for the price of the cameras and subscription it should be expected to have a quality app interface. I will be looking for a better setup until nest gets some smarter engineers building their app and would suggest you do the same."}

This app is being used for the outdoor cameras. This app is maddeningly cumbersome. Useablity, on rewinding, rotating  screen to see content skips to different time events. Talk back is barely functional due to lag, interface not responding and major lag on Mic shutting off in time to hear persons response assuming you can get it to work. They need to get someone to real world test this app because it's a message for cameras. I believe it functioned better before an update but not sure. I suspect Ring is a better product. Nest needs to fix this app for the camera as it's functionality as a security camera is not working in real-time 2-way device. More stars will be earned if they can get their act together."}

Firstly, it is bad policy to turn on bluetooth without asking for permission from user, even if you need it for technical reasons.   Secondly, you are invading user privacy, and causing inconvenience.  When the protects are connected via network, why are you using Bluetooth. At the minimum ask the user if they need the app to talk to protects using bluetooth, or are they just trying to set temperature.   And why doesnt ANDROID allow user to decide if an app should be able to turn on or off bluetooth. Probably because sneaky companies are using bluetooth beacons to track user location without giving the user an option to disable that."}

Someone attempted to gain entry to my house and the video clip I was trying to send to the police had absolutely no date/time or any context. It makes things REALLY confusing and near impossible to determine the order of things when you are comparing video clips between 2 different cameras. Come on guys. Also the app is really laggy when clicking on an \"event\" in portrait mode then switching to landscape, the video cuts out and you miss the event. Also since last update when I slide my finger along the video theres no time lapse. We all spend sooo much monthly for these little features that aren't little the are necessary.

The app tells me how it hasn't heard from my phone for a few days.... I don't know how it can be so misinformed. It doesn't even recognise that I am logged into the WiFi at work, which would be acceptable. I bought Nest over Hive due to the close links with Google.

Simply figure out the heat transfer rates based on how often the system has to cycle on and off with a specific exterior temperature.       Also, why the heck isn't there any graph of temperature history, let alone one that compares interior to exterior temperature over the course of a month??

Camera randomly turns on even though it it set to \"Home\" and I'm home! Back to ****  Update: geofencing finally worked! Thank you! 5 stars!   Previous version: 4 stars because I can't rate 3.5 stars. Reasons being:  1. I had to use my laptop to set up the camera coz the app wouldn't/can't recognize the camera. It also took a while on my laptop (Mac) because it didn't automatically start like what were usually used to. I think what caused the installation issue on the app is that my router has two frequencies and the nest cam takes a different one over my phone..? I dunno.. But anyway, I got it to install and it's all good now. \u263a 2. Geofencing does not work. It's a small issue. I only have to manually tell the app that I'm either home or away. But it would be nice if it worked and does the switching over for me.  Other than those two issues, I love the camera! Does exactly what I want and need it to do. I got the camera because my fire alarms at home set off for no reason while I'm at work.

I tried removing and reinstalling all my cameras and it's still messed up. Customer service was no help resolving the issue. I hope a future update fixes it.  Edit #1: I finally discovered (on my own) what the issue is. Unless you have \"person seen\" activated, you will not get notifications in an activity zone when someone walks by. With this option turned off, you will only get notifications for motion. For example: a bird flying by or waving your hand directly in front of the camera. This is extremely unfortunate for people who only want person seen notifications in specific activity zone instead of in the entire camera's field of vision. For example: a camera pointing outside where people regularly walk by, but you are only interested in notifications in a specific zone. The only other option is to turn on \"person seen\" and get a million notifications throughout the day and hope that one of them is within the activity zone you actually care about. I really hope they fix this so \"person seen\" is a unique option for each activity zone instead of the camera overall. Currently, it's a broken feature. Edit #2: still no good feedback from Nest on how to solve the notification issues. I've had to \"hack\" my cameras by smudging/dirtying the lens making the video quality blurry. This tricks the camera into not recognizing if a person walks in an activity zone. Instead, it only sees it as motion which results in the notifications I want. Pretty sad that I have to do this in order to get a simple feature to work. Edit #3: I unsubscribed from Nest Aware since there is still an issue with motion alerts and person alerts. No point in throwing away money."}

Like it was never even tested. Dropcam app has always been better. I read an article about the original developer and how he regrets ever selling the company because of how Google/Nest have completely neglected the platform. The new group is only interested in sales and has zero interest in supporting and improving the products beyond that. I have witnessed the decline in quality and service from Dropcam and am moving on. Disgusting to have the resources they do and not to utilize them by hiring good people to support their products/customers and by not investing in obviously needed improvements. Just read the real reviews, the ones that have similar complaints. The 5 star reviews with zero details are obviously created by Nest to boost their score...and how sad that they can't get above a measly 4.0. There is no way that this app is working well enough for anyone to rate it above a 1. Like I said, it's garbage. How anyone can feel good about working on this app and for this company is amazing.

I have two of these thermostats in my home.  Three months running and I've discovered that Home/Away assist is totally broken which is the backbone of Nest's energy saving system.  I've figured out that you must deactivate the thermostats activity sensors for home/away assist in order for the thermostats to go to 'away' mode using just the cell phone location when you leave the home.  If you don't, the sensors always 'sense' activity and keep them in home mode. I have no pets or any other factors that cause movement when we aren't home.  Second big issue as of late: both thermostats randomly drop offline and I cannot see them from the app (Android). This is a new problem and I have changed nothing on my network so...  Yeah, irritating.  Glad I got them on sale and stacked 10% off coupons at Lowe's because these aren't worth retail price. I wish that I didn't have to have every shiny new tech toy that came out.

Although there will occasionally be a lag in notifications, or a break in wifi connectivity, the app is consistently diligent about notifying us, whether home or away, that there has been movement or sound in our son's room.  We can rely on it to keep us in the know, and with recent updates it has become even more user friendly.  Both initial setup and use throughout have remained nearly effortless, and though we have opted for the free version (rather than pay monthly for premium Nest coverage) we did not experience a loss in quality.  Highly recommended."}

{"Author": "Ellin Park", "Date": "June 27, 2017", "Stars": " Rated 1 stars out of five stars ", "Text": " <span class=\"review-title\"></span> The Logi Circle is better! I bought both at the same time but expected the Nest Cam to be superior because of its higher cost. I've found the Nest Cam to be inferior in several different aspects but I'll focus the app here.  The Nest app is terribly unintuitive and badly designed for a company owned by alphabet/google.   Problem 1: I can't scrub through the sightline to a specific time. The app will mislead you into thinking that you can since you can drag the blue marker line to a specific time, but once you let go, the video will skip forward or backward to the beginning or end of whatever Nest decides is the activity event. This means I'll waste a bunch of time trying to get closer and closer to a certain event before realizing the app won't let me go to a specific time. Then I'll give up and waste my life starting from the beginning of whatever they decide is the start of the activity. For example, I might know that a specific event happened right around 10:32:50, but I'll only be able to start watching from 10:30:00 because Nest might decide that that was the start of the activity. I can't skip right to the action. Problem 1.5: After wasting a bunch of time watching activity I'm not interested to get to the meat, I accidentally discovered you can speed up this process by touching the video. When you touch the screen, little button overlays will show up that will allow you to go backwards or forwards 15 seconds. It's still imprecise and you still waste time having to watch activity you're no interested in of you have a specific time in mind. This is also unintuitive. Why would I randomly decide to touch the above video playback while I'm trying to use the sightline below to scrub through the recordings? Terrible design.  Problem 2: If I decide to save a clip, I don't know what I'm getting until I press the save/share button (the icon is also badly designed... it should be a simple downward download arrow, not a freaking right facing arrow). Once I click that button, I'll get a pop up message saying that the clip was added to my nest aware account. Then the next screen shows the clip that was added which is ridiculous because they only show you the clip after you click the save/sharw button. The clip might be 15s long or 1min long. The clip may contain the activity you wanted, or it may not. I don't know how they decide what should be clipped but it's terribly unintuitive and a huge waste of time. For example, if an activity of interest happens around 10:32:50, I might want to save a clip from 10:32:45 to 10:33:30. But I don't get to select the beginning or the end. I don't even get an option to specify that at least a certain time should be included in whatever interval they decide is best. And there's no way for me to pause at 10:32:50 and tap the save button. So I end up tapping the save button while the recording is playing and hope that the part I'm watching gets included in the clip they decide to save. It's not garanteed that the part you're interested will be included since they don't let you specify what you're interested in. Problem 2.5: Further, on this next screen after you click the save button and the message pops up saying the clip was added to your account, there is a \"cancel\" button option. Cancel what?! I thought the clip was already added to my account. If there is a cancel option, then were is the confirm/continue option? If I press cancel, then does the clip get removed from my account? What happens if I go back on my phone without tapping any of their button? It's unclear.  Problem 3: So you get this message saying that this clip was added to your account, but there is no way for you to actually access your clips on your account on the app. ??? (I think you have to use a computer.)  Problem 4: After you have wasted your life trying to get close to a specific time, you might decide to change your phone orientation. Big mistake! Instead of continuing, the marker skips back to the beginning of the activity clip and you have to waste your life again trying to find the activity at the specific time."}

I now tell others that they are wasting thier money with nest products and services since the online service costs money for something that never works!

It would be better if the app would show and retain the running times for heat (aux &amp; normal) and cooling.

Plus unless you actually look at each day it rounds up to the next 15 minutes.  Plus, I am very very disappointed with the monthly report.

I may have a resolution?     As of this review, it's been about an hour and so far so good. Since my update, today is the first time I am home on a day off. Today my home started to get really cold. I checked the NEST (not the app) and said I was on ECO. I then checked phone (S7 Edge if it matters any to this issue), and I was away. Which then quickly changed to HOME and started to heat. As soon as I got out of the app and put my phone down, ok walked by and I was on EVO again. Checked phone again, and I was away, then it went back to HOME and started to heat. (PS... I only use the phones location to detect if home since the home sensors keep picking up my cats and think we are home when at work.)    I looked up reviews and saw something about GOOGLE Assistant being on Nougat, So I checked this by pressing and holding the home button on phone and Assistant opened. I followed the tutorial and clicked the 3 dots top right corner, then settings, HOME CONTROL,add device, and there was the NEST. Clicked that and had to sign into NEST account. Now they are linked.     Since I did that... my thermostat is working again and has not switched to ECO while home! If this happens again, I will update and contact NEST but I wonder if with the new update to NOUGAT things are thrown off. Even other apps I use don't remember my phone and have to start fresh each login. Hope this helps at all."}

Pop-up messages over video are terrible and constant. If I tap on full screen view then I don't want to see anything but video until I tap otherwise! The old interface allowed me to scroll through all motion events and had a moving thumbnail for each event which was great. The new interface only shows a single image for just some events making quick event viewing ability much worse than before. I simply can't see all events anymore with this interface which is clunky and imprecise.  Response to vendor: The banner blocks the upper 1/5 to 1/4 of the camera image when it pops up. I bought 3 cameras and 2 Nest Aware subscriptions but I can't stop the pop-ups unless I pay for that third subscription... right. These cameras are becoming more of an iToy than serious security devices."}

It is all working correctly, and apart from now setting up the schedule times for heating and hot water, we are absolutely delighted with the products.  My only negative comment is regarding the time settings for heat or water. These are in 30 minute increments. It should be possible with future software updates to change time settings by 5 minute increments, giving the user more precise control over scheduling.

It takes 60 Mb on disk just to show temperature circular bar and a couple of setting pages 2. Application launching takes forever. To adjust temperature takes time too. So it is quicker to go down stairs and set temperature manually than to wait the application to do that. 3. It always requires internet connection so if you have internet outage you have no remote service. Philips HUE application does not need internet when you use it at home and it works much faster. 4. Password is required to be secure so you have to enter digits, upper and lower case letters and at least one special symbol $#@!. Why do they require all that stuff. I do not manage my bank account with Nest and why do they what those 4 symbols to be entered? Why don't the use %^&amp;*()?  Overall this application is like condom: nobody likes - everybody uses because other options are even worse."}

Just give me control and stop giving my devices wills of their own. I understand putting those features in, but removing or overiding the manual toggles makes them uncontrollable."}

Furthermore, it doesn't have a proper full screen mode the banner displaying the room name (which serves no useful benefit) keeps popping up covering the screen. I don't know how that is not a standard thing for any video/streaming app.  Given that Nest is also an Alphabet company same as Google/YouTube, I don't understand how this video streaming app is SOOO much worse than YouTube.

With the new update its difficult to say if your feed is live. Earlier a timestamp with the feed gave an idea of how much lag is there. Unless one has Nest Aware, Activity History is a pain taking up screen space and not doing much. There should me an option to have/not have the section. Switching to Night Vision and back doesn't happen automatically anymore. Although i have set the switching to auto it never switches on its own."}

The added feature to see still images of events if you are not subscribed to their service is kind of neat.   We use it as a baby monitor and love it so far.  The only feature I would like is for you to be able to set it to have no visual display unless noise is detected."}

It's difficult (compared to the previous layout) to zoom in on the start of a clip. Clicking on the clip in sightline takes you into the middle of it, rather than the start (the way it used to). Being able to zoom forwards and backwards in time (sightline) sounds interesting, but is only useful if there is activity throughout the entire time line, but these cameras are (probably for everyone) recording mostly still life. So the only pieces most users care about are the clips of activity. That said, why make it more difficult to find those and to play the clip at the start (rather than the middle) of activity?
