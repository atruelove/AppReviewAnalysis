WHY? Why would this Insteon app use 6 GB of cellular data while not even being used?    I really really dislike Insteon now. It did it once more and used 2 GB more data before I caught it and killed the app in Android Setup.  It's a huge risk to even have this app loaded on my phone now.  What was it doing?

The back arrow goes to the login screen... really? Every time I want to turn on a light I have to select the icon, and then another on/off icon ... really?      I chose Insteon because of its X10 support but I'm a disappointed that there is no feedback that X10 commands have been dispatched and you can't even use X10 modules in scenes. This app is rated below 3 star (and dropping).  Come on Insteon how do you expect to excel with an app like this? Update: when I got home last night my X10 modules would not respond.  So I tried an Insteon module and it would not respond either.

I have the assurance kit, nothing crazy, and all the sensors and gizmos work as they should, would give those 5 stars.  Now on to the app, the Achilles heal of the bundle.  It is a confusing mess of menus and poor flow.  If I launch straight from icon, it will auto login like I want.  But I hate that if I hit the back arrow to try and get back to the main menu or even close the app, it brings me back to the login screen without a password prefilled and then if I hit it again it wants me to either add an account or enter my info.  At that point i either have to type in the password, or close it completely to relaunch which then makes it sync with the hub again.  If you already have an account, there is no reason why it should even go to that page.  The menus are terrible.  There is no button to go straight to your devices, you have to click the room first then all devices.  I have only 5 devices, i find this annoying.    The thermostat icon is always at the bottom, no matter if you have one or not."}

I actually can't think of a time when I would ever want to sign out.  Editing information isn't intuitive. There is a context-sensitive edit button on the bottom that allows scene, device, and room editing, but getting into the right context is a bit confusing. I'd rather have a single menu that displays \"edit devices\", \"edit room\" and \"edit scene\" rather having to remember that I have to be in the Room menu and \"Edit This\" to change device properties.

It would appear that the core of the Insteon system is quite sophisticated but this does not translate well in the app (which is the sole method of control). Unless you are grounded in the more arcane procedures of linking devices and using one or another as a controller, this will not work for you. Unfortunately, you are left to your own devices (as it were) to \"figure out\" how things work. Functions that should be simple and intuitive to program, are not. After the second or third time you turn off a light switch and watch every controlled device go out, or arrive (or wake) to find that a programmed sequence simply does not execute, you will move on. Take a look at Insteon's updated product documentation to get a feel for the complexity of the system. Unfortunately, at this level, \"you can't ge there from here\"."}

Also, why do I have to add every switch to All devices, and then add it to rooms.  I have to give them longer names to keep them sorted this way.

Added an open close sensor to my garage door and back gate so I can get an email and a text message when they open or close.  I have UPnP turned on in my router and the hub installed quickly without any problems. It's slow to get to it when off my network but it does seem to finally connect.  Scenes aren't as powerful as HouseLinc and a couple took a few tries to get right. I agree with whoever mentioned timers needing some upgrading - HouseLinc is still going to be running most of my schedules at least until the next version comes out.  I got one of my 2 IP cameras to install right away, the second camera took a bit of work but that could have been a problem with my network or the distance of the camera from my router.

Hub has a greater potential, but they released this product before integrating older components such as fanlinc and houselinc. Products that are compatible are still badass though.

I found the manual online and was able to get port forwarding configured and all is working fine.  It walks you through the steps well.  Configuring devices not intuitive, but fairly easy.  Just wish you could schedule random on/off times.  Once configured, it works very well."}

Works sometimes on some devices. Sometimes it does not connect to hub, then it does without changing any settings.  Need to be rock solid from device to device. Seems it doesn't get configuration from the hub when requested. Schedules don't update causing devices to run on old schedules. My biggest pain?  Why can't the hub/app turn off or on devices at the same scheduled time without having to add them to a scene?  Even scenes cant."}
