The instructions said it would not be compatible with my existing lock however it came with everything I needed even if I had no existing lock. The app started off a little finicky due to the verification process. Just remember to close the app after completing the verification process then opening it and starting your ekeying procedures. I use the same account on both my phone and my wife's phone so I did not have to generate another set of keys however this may cause me issues later, I guess I will find out. I love the fact that it does not connect to the Internet so it being hacked is less of a worry. Locks do not need access to the internet due to your phone being able to program them locally and you can email the ekey to someone if they need to get in without you being home. I have not tried this yet but hopefully will soon. The only issue I have at the moment is the possibility of your phone being too close to the lock while being home which can allow someone to walk up and unlock your door if your phone is too close. That can be solved by simply turning off your Bluetooth while at home but that is not something people will like to do. So far it works great with no issues."}

This is because they are back ordered for 2 months. My unit was brand new.  I brought it back to best buy and exchanged and paid the difference on a 2nd gen kevo that has the same issue.  It will not update and the app is useless.  I have a samsung galaxy s6 edge, Bluetooth enabled with sharing.  Great idea poorly made.  Very disappointing.

When the direction tell you to follow in app instructions. You must first push the + sign in the app to add the hub. No where and I repeat no where that I looked whether it was online or in forums did it say this. Since then we have had the hub hooked up for a week with no issues. We have been using the lock for 3 weeks. We did notice before the hub there was a little bit of a lag when locking or unlocking by Bluetooth but since it seems to be more efficient. The sending of ekeys is an excellent bonus we have used this option multiple times with no problems."}

My biggest complaint is that you can't see the history for all entries and exits (manual key and fob) and you can't control the day / time access for a fob.  I can't give a service an e-key as it changes people, but I can give out a fob.  However you loose all capabilities with the fob and have to reset the device to remove it if lost."}

I love the concept of this lock, but the execution is horrible. I bought the lock because I was led to believe that all I would have to do was have my phone in my pocket and I could unlock my door with the touch of a a finger. I reality I touch the lock, the blue ring flashes, then I have to take my phone out of my pocket notice that the app is sleeping, then open the app because it tells me to move my phone to awaken it but it won't, once I open the app, it will connect to the lock and then I can open it with the touch of my finger. I wish that they would have told me that this was the way that they had programmed it and I would have saved myself $180 buck and not bought this. The great part is that I have tried to call their support line but they are closed due to a system outage."}

It is a battery pig, it has a wear component that crashes 12-20 times a day. The functionality for wear isnt active until wear 2.0 comes out, and you cant disable it from running the wear component so a 2nd and 3rd poke in the eye. I had to use my wifes iphone to update the locks, then uninstall and reinstall the android app to get the locks to work with my android nexus 6p.  Unikey does NOT respond to requests for help from their webpage or the kevo page. The lock is excellent, the software is poop. They should be embarrassed and their mother should smack them. This is a perfect example of the need for less than 1 star in the rating system."}

Got the phone home, only to be advised by Google Play that the app is incompatible.   After a few days, and many hours with tech support, uninstalling, reinstalling etc. etc. it was finally resolved by them tweaking something on their end.  Current Status: Update phone to Marshmallow (6.0.1 - STOCK) a few weeks ago, and all continues to work fine.  Reset my phone to factory tonight, go to download app and the farking thing is telling me it is incompatible.  This is utter crap.  It has been working just fine under Marshmallow for weeks.  Now I have an expensive lock I cannot lock/unlock VIA the phone.  This is clearly the ONLY reason to purchase said lock.   Y'all need to allow the app to be loaded, or refund my money.

They also would like you to pay extra for VIRTUAL KEYS!!!  Really?  The Kevo does not link with the home automation hub, Wink, not sure if it works with Samsung or Apple's automation products, remote access requires their junk.  The lock doesn't work if you're already paired to a bluetooth device.  The app force closes on my Moto360 watch.    The physical quality of the lock is about a 3/10, I'm pretty sure you could defeat the lock with a decent screwdriver.  The lock is very loud, both mechanically as well as the beep tones if you leave them enabled.  This one is going back to the store, I'll stick with a good old regular z-wave lock, my Wink hub loves z-wave.  If someone is going to break in, I'd rather it be a hacker than a kid with a screwdriver.  Nest integration works ***great.

I preordered my first Kevo with the promise of an \"Android app coming soon\". Actually what happened is they took there time and waited 1.5 years to even release an android app. I patiently sat around and even ended up buying an iPad mini so that I did not have to use the key fob, that did not work half as well as it should have, just to get an app to update my lock and be able to open my door. So the next hurdle has been that suddenly I can't install this on the newest android phones. It has been like this going on a month. I tell you what UniKey..... You can keep your Kevo 2 and stick it where the sun doesn't shine. You claim to have heard peoples issues with your device, but it looks like to me the only thing you did was redesign the mechanics of the lock and added a few new features..... How is this lock any good if you don't support or upgrade the app in a timely fashion. I am keeping my 200"}
