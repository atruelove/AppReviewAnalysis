I'm not a huge fan of my dot to begin with but the app just destroys any positive feelings I might have had.   One of the biggest things I use the app for is text to speech on my Kindle books. Not only can I not arrange how I want the icons to look or hide services I don't use, but I can't   search through my books for the title I want or sort them. It is also virtually impossible to just say \"Alexa read XXXXX\" because she has no idea what I'm talking about.  My roommate foumd the same thing when she tried to get the app to read to her. You have to dig through all the books to find the one you want and then hit play.   Also, Alexa is extremely  spotty with pronunciation (i.e., a character whose name is Manny sometimes gets called Man, sometimes pronounced Many and sometimes pronounced Manny; a character named Colin is sometimes prounced like Cawlin and sometimes like Colon).  All that being said, the biggest thing I hate about the app is that it randomly stops, as if a sleep timer went off and it stops reading. If I wake her up by saying \"Alexa\", she reads a few more words and then stops or she will randomly start reading again (i.e., a 3 am the book will come back on for a sentence or two and then will stop again). This would continue the whole book if I let it. Amazon says it's most likely the internet connection but I can tell you it absolutely is not.   I realize Alexa was a pioneer in AI in her early days, but one would think Amazon would have improved her since then. Not so much."}

So now we're purging conservative radio stations from the Amazon/Alexa feed, huh?  I tried to ask Alexa to play my favorite radio station, and I got back \"105.9 FM WMAL on iHeart Radio isn't available right now.\"  Just to make sure it wasn't a temporary glitch, I waited and asked again, and got the same, only restated: \"105.9 FM WMAL on iHeart Radio is currently not available.\"  Which is funny (NOT), 'cause I can go straight to iHeart Radio on my Android tablet, and it immediately plays, just fine.  Amazon, you had better stop boycotting/purging stations just 'cause you don't like their content!  Not happy at all with Amazon over this.  Fix now!  Immediately!  Or you will be reported to the FCC!  ////  Second Update:  Finally, Landscape Mode has been restored!!  Thank you, Amazon, for providing this update for all of us tablet owners, and for the disabled who rely on Landscape Mode for their special devices.  As I said before, this has always been a 5 Star application.  Brilliantly thought out.  Superbly executed.  Great UI.  Now that it supports tablets, it is perfect.  Thanks again, Amazon!  BVI User.  ////  First Update: After calling and emailing Amazon, Landscape Mode has still not been restored for their handicapped/disabled users.  Numerous reviews have been posted by other handicapped/disabled people asking why, and no response from Amazon.  Poor customer response and service.  So, down to One Star you go.  What a shame, for an otherwise responsible and squared-away company.  Pay attention to your handicapped/disabled users!  ////  This would have been a 5 Star review...  Until yesterday.  Minus One Star for taking away Landscape Mode.  Hey, some of out here have large screen tablets and are not gonna twist them around just to see your app's screen.  Those of us with Visual Impairments need the widescreen display.  Please make the orientation an option, Landscape or Portrait.  Minus One Star for removing the identifying colors and symbols for our music apps.  Again, those of us with Visual Impairments used to be able to find our iHeartRadio app by looking for the \"red square.\"  The TuneIn Radio app was easily located by looking for the \"aqua square.\"  Granted, I'm sure that the black &amp; white menus look very modern and sophisticated, but they're not friendly for the Visually Impaired.  Please add an option to put the color back.  Otherwise, great app!  I can control my Tap from either my tablet or new iPhone seamlessly.  Just please be considerate of us Visually Impaired people.  Thanks.  5 Stars once you provide these options.  BVI user."}

The echo device is great once setup. But the setup process is too painful and annoying. During setup at times it just doesn't recognize wifi networks. If I change my wifi passpord, running the whole setup is too difficult. The app ( or rather the website undeneath app ) also gets unresponsive sometimes in few setup screens, specially after the app connects to echo and it shows a 'Continue' button which doesn't respond. EDIT: I got a new echo Dot and setup is hung up on step showing 'Attempting to connect to echo dot'. The phone got connected to the dots WiFi but nothing happens in setup process.

Never had 1 issue. It understands me 99.9% of the time the other .1% is because either the tv is too loud but not the device itself. Someone was talking carp about searching music. Just say a name of a song or artist and it will be played. I think most reviews are due to user error and not the device. Sure the app could use a little work but for the most part it works flawlessly. Easy to find skills and set alarms, add more devices and link my smart home devices. I don't know why people say it's hard to connect to WiFi because it is the easiest device I've ever hooked up to my wifi. Its never lost connection either. Only when the power has gone out but as soon as it's back on so is alexa. I have over 70 devices paired with the app and alexa has not once messed up when giving a command to lock a door or turn on a light. I would definitely recommend it over Google home any day."}

Why is playing Amazon's own music service so hard? Sometimes Alexa doesn't understand me and I want to play a specific song or album from Amazon Music Unlimited - you can't, apparently it's just radio and popular. What on Earth and I paying for this service for then? Spotify gives you full control of Alexa music from the app.   Also while the new whole home audio festure is welcome, it's still lacking.

{"Author": "Mike St James", "Date": "July 29, 2017", "Stars": " Rated 1 stars out of five stars ", "Text": " <span class=\"review-title\"></span> Disappointing. Both Echo and the Alexa app. The weather skill can't even tell you humidity. Now, as of July 28, control of Wemo devices has become erratic and semi-functional. I have updated Wemo device firmware, re-enabled the Wemo account connection, re-dscovered devices within the Alexa app, but it's still extremely retarded, with very long delays between the command and whatever execution it decides to implement (which varies from attempt to attempt.) I might blame Wemo, since it's a terrible app as well, but all devices are currently working fine from the Wemo app. My main motivation with Alexa/Echo was home automation control, but it's not reliable. Waking up to a noise, and saying \"Alexa; lights on\" should, you know, turn on the lights. But Alexa hesitates for a substantial period of time, then might (or might not) turn on a totally random selection of Wemo devices. Not ready for Prime time, pun intended. Alexa and my Echo devices are mostly just music streaming speakers now, and the only devices with a decent speaker for that purpose are the tall original Echos. Besides, with Amazon devices, unlike Google Home, you can't get the same stream coordinated on multiple devices concurrently. The Echo Show speakers are very directional (and the device is also hard of hearing.) If I could undo the whole mess, I would today."}

Additionally, the artists with \"the\" in the title are all listed under \"the\" alphabetically. There's no filtering in order to narrow it down to the artists you want.

Not only is it a manipulative and sleazy way to get people to \"opt-in\" (by making it very difficult to avoid opting in and still using the product), it also doesn't let you turn the feature off, you HAVE TO CALL AMAZON CUSTOMER SUPPORT to disable a very invasive unwanted and nearly useless feature.  Super sleazy on Amazon's part. Especially for an app with so many rampant privacy issues."}

Calls and messaging setup comes with the app being on a cellphone or tablet with call and messaging features. Skills setup was slightly challenging in the absence of printed instructions in the box with the Dot.  I had all of my smart plug connected devices enabled and controlled by Alexa in about 10 minutes. I did have to change abbreviated names to full names for Alexa to recognize and complete commands. I am impressed with the limited use I have employed so far. My next test will be disconnecting power and reconnecting to determine if there is continuity with the setup and connection to Amazon echo services since I do not intend to have my DOT connected 24/7 for privacy considerations."}
