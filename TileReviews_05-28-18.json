There's nothing on the screen to press so it will sound off. The tile goes off but at random like maybe every 20min average on its own. I have no control over it. The tile itself is supposed to be able to call my phone by pressing twice on the time itself, nothing. Not one Goddamn call to my phone. The tile just plays its little tune without connecting via signal to my phone. The only thing working is the map but what good is that if I can't trigger the tag?"}

One died, can not just replace battery so I should buy a new one for the cost of a 50 cent battery? I don't think so.... Revised again: update to their software today. Out of 4 tiles, the tile app only finds one. All 4 are only 8 feet away sitting next to each other. No doubt I'm switching brands now. Devices that don't connect are worthless. 11 months and 4 say they need replacing, the 5th is dead. $100 to replace them? I don't think so. I can find the tiles about 50% of the time if I fool around turning on/off Bluetooth, going in and out of the app, and waving my phone over the tile while saying a prayer. Junk, that's it going in the trash so I can't waste my time trying to make them work."}

I continued to try working and solving the problem when I was told multiple time that they are sorry that it doesn't meet my expectations: --Ina (Tile Customer Care) emailed me Mar 2, 6:28 PM PST after a new complaint; instead of resolving the problem\"I am sorry to hear that our products does not meet your expectations.\" and suggested I contact feedback. --(09:12:18 PM) Dine @ Tile: Sorry if Tile doesn't meet your needs. Now the ringing of the tile doesn't even work. I lost my keys and they are somewhere in a store, but it just will not ring even if connected. Also the proximity meter does nothing to tell you how close you are. I'm either connected, near, or not connected. They refuse to return my money as they continue to give me the run around. I recommend that your return this product ASAP before you find out later it barely works"}

Update: the problem is not that it does not perform as intended is rather that for someone like me who does not lose things in their house because they know were things are it serves no purpose. The fundamental problem is that this relies on Bluetooth thus your item you search for will be within 30 meters. So if you really loose something (not in your house) you wont find it. What I am interested in is tracking stuff like a backpack (in case some one steels it, or gets lost at the airport). For this would be nice to have a rechargeable tile with GSM or GPS connectivity to the phone or something like that."}

I lost my keys at Bonnaroo (music festival for those who don't know) and despite the lost and found team hunting and the clean vibes team hunting I never saw them again and I had to buy a new key fob for my car. Being a procrastinator I am always running out the door last second. Now instead of spending an extra unplanned 10 minutes hunting for my keys and being late for work I just reach for my phone and turn on the Bluetooth and ring my keys. (Despite what I've read you don't have to keep your Bluetooth on all the time and drain your battery. I keep my Bluetooth off until I need to find them and have no issues doing it this way.. but then again I'm never hunting for them further than 100ft maybe). Sometimes they fell behind my bed or maybe they're right in front of me laying on the kitchen table, either way I have them in less than 60 seconds. It's helped me so much I just decided to buy the 4 pack combo with 2 slims and 2 mates. I'm always losing my wallet; falling out of my pocket, leaving it in my car between the seats, laying it down at a friend's house, etc so I got the slim for that and since the 4 pack is just $30 more than a slim by itself it made since to get the 4 pack. Now I have one for my car so I can find it in huge parking lots, from Walmart to amusement parks.. this saves time, and then 2 others I can still find a purpose for. It's truly a great product with a great service and worth every penny I've spent on them."}

I am well impressed with it, so much so I bought a pack of 4 which included 2 key and 2 wallet tiles. I have saved hours of time with the help of this product already this year!!! There are areas for improvement though which is why I've gave a 4 star rating. First of all the battery issue....I personally think it's wrong you buy a product that will be no good after 12 months especially with how much they are to buy in the first place. It either needs a charging port or adapted to charge through a wireless charger. Failing that a battery that lasts longer. Or heavily discount the replacement fee after the 12 month period. Sometimes the Bluetooth struggles to find Item if you're just outside the house but item is in the 100ft range. I'm guessing but I reckon most people loose keys and wallets in there own homes so would there be a way to locate your tile through WiFi rather than Bluetooth which is more prone to interference from solid objects? It would also be handy if it was a bit louder than it is, especially the wallet version as it's in an enclosed space. Maybe changing speaker location if to much drain on battery! This product is the key to lost items (pardon the pun) and has great potential it's just not quite there yet."}

Marketing is so incredibly aggressive. Every day they ask me if I want to buy more tiles. I mean could you imagine if every product you ever bought bought you every day to buy more? Can't find a way to stop them, I'm looking for alternative tracking products so I can switch and block them. On the up side, the product is finally working pretty well, dead tiles alert you before they die and they seem to last almost the advertised length. I worry that the marketing is so aggressive because they company isn't in the black and i'll end up with $200 in tracking tiles that can't be used or get my information sold off, starving companies make poor life decisions."}

Since it's still under warranty, they're going to send me a replacement tile. That doesn't help me find my keys, but good customer service. Added 1 star for that, but I stand by my original review that Bluetooth is unreliable for tracking. *Original* - The concept is good, but the execution is lacking. For one, most people don't just walk around with their Bluetooth on. So if you lose your phone, the function to ring it with the the tile is essentially useless. Updating the tile location also seems inconsistent and unreliable. I lost my keys while out of the house last weekend. My tile location hasn't been updated since July 19 (4 months), but I know for a fact I have been around the tile with my Bluetooth on more recently than 4 months ago, and supposedly other people with the Tile app nearby should also update the location. If they could figure out a more reliable way to track than with Bluetooth, it would be a great app. It's also quite expensive for what you get IMO."}

The thing is also a battery suck. For something that works very unreliably. Now for the fun part. Watch me get a very generic reply, expressing disappointment that I'm having trouble with the app, and you email them, and blah, blah, blah.

My dumbass assin tired-ass ass apparently thought it would be a fantastic idea to wedge my wallet (containing my passport and a freshly acquired visa) in between a keyboard and an old PC behind a full tray of tuna cans last night. My dumbass assin ass paid no regard to the fact that my future dumbass self had an international flight the next day for a uni project I was fortunate enough to be funded for because some poor soul put enough trust in me to be responsible for something. If I missed this flight - and had to take the time replace my wallet and passport/visa - I would have inflicted a betrayal worse than Judas himself on my peers and even moreso, myself. Cue the morning following the offense: 1. Silently panic. 2. Visibly and audibly panic. 3. Fervent upturning of my entire room and the living room. Note I had just moved back home the night before so this involved rummaging through a dozen bags, none of which had any clear logic or sense of categorization in their contents. Also included: intermittent assumption of the foetal position on the floor. No dice. 4. Lightly consider using the Tile app, which I had bitterly uninstalled months prior to clear up space and because I felt it hadn't paid itself back at all. But it probably wouldn't help because my dumba-- thought I must have lost it on the street in the bountiful boroughs of western Sydney. Knowing my dumba-- self, this is generally the most likely scenario and in less dire situations I would have already surrendered to this fate. 5. Rummage hopelessly some more, consider calling the Lebanese garlic chicken restaurant I was at last night (they weren't open at 9am.) 6. Reinstall Tile. What the hell! It still works. What the double hell!! My wallet is nearby. Never have I felt both so cursed and blessed by the gods at once. I excavated my wallet from the mass of tuna cans and discarded computer peripherals as Martha and Mary did roll away the stone from Lazarus' tomb, and that fine MIDI jingle that emanated from my wallet proclaimed to me: \"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whoever liver and believeth in me shall never die\".

Then you get to buy another one! Not my cup of tea. There's a product called Trackr that is smaller, takes a replacement battery you can buy anywhere, and you own it for life. The most irritating aspect, however is that the return/replace policy is deep in the literature about the device, so as the average consumer starts search for how to recharge the device. You read more, then you discover that you get to buy a new one when the old one dies. No thanks."}

I tried the report lost feature got no response. 3 hours later still say last seen at home. I got a response when my partner got back home. Pretty useless in my book. Her phone should have picked it up and report to me. That is the purpose of sharing and community function right? Then i stop the sharing. Went to the Tile and double press it. Her phone rings?? It didnt stop ringing til I unlock her phone. Yes you read it right, only stop ringing her phone when i unlock her phone to check Why. I check her device list, the Tile is not listed on her app and somehow still got the ring tones. Double press on the tile again ring my phone this time. All the main selling points of this product all failed. And it gets worst... I try to do a transfer. Fill in email and all i got back was \"oops! something went wrong.\" The tile app must not be close and need to be login. If u accidentally kill ur background apps then this device is literally useless. This seem rather short sighted by the developer. Should be a background service and not rely on people having this app in background."}

HOWEVER, when it came time to replace my original Tile with a Tile Sport, it took almost an hour to get it to pair. Sometimes it would not see the tile via Bluetooth, then sometimes it would see it, start to do the replace, then fail. I also tried adding it as a tile style, and it would tell me it didn't see a tile style, but a sport and asked me to add it. I know the Bluetooth was fine, I could set off the original Tile locator fine, and also two other devices were unable to add it as well. I hope this isn't a sign of the new tile sport's reliability with the app, I kinda wish now I stayed with the original. It's still a good product, maybe the two newest ones were rushed to market with some bugs..."}

What would it take to make a premium tile with a standalone GPS Beacon or a rechargeable battery for use on the highly valuable items.$5,000 purses or laptops. Maybe one for your car that you can plug in and never forget where you park. Or even a tile that would be permanent and unremovable so if your item gets stolen then you will always be able to find it. (Similar to LoJack) I am grateful for the entire tile company. I use my tiles on many items and put some of them to great use!

However, after about a year, every time you open the app it tells you you need to buy entirely new tiles and replace them. First off, if they are only meant to last a year, why does each tile visit so much? Secondly, why would you design the tiles to only last a key. (My electric key for my car lasted 5 years before it needed a new battery.) Third, why haven't the tiles been designed so that we can replace the dead battery ourselves; this design clearly represents pure greed on the company's part. Finally, the app isn't actually measuring the battery strength of the actual tiles; mine have worked for a few months beyond when Tile started harassing me through the app to replace all my tiles at full cost.

Just like the same scam on TrackerR, tile is no different. They're not going to tell you the truth on Bluetooth range, whether it is affected by buildings and walls or car bodies. All talk and no actions. The only way you can track things is by using a GPS locator that uses a SIM card with 1Gb of data. These may be a little costly but you can be sure on tour mother's grave you will find what you've lost. And then you will surprised and say money well spent! But not on this rubbish if it used Bluetooth. We already know Bluetooth is a low range signal so there is no way you will find your lost belongings unless you are just metres from a Tile tracker, or unless millions of phones have the App installed for pinging one another. If that's the case it may only be good in cities but if you lost the item, pet, car, in the bush, while camping, etc., ?? Only a GPS locator can find what you lost anywhere on Earth. Don't waste your money on puny little kid's toys."}

The app never lets my phone go to sleep. I haven't had to replace the batteries yet but other reviewers say you can't. Waste of money."}

I'll continue testing, but it seems to be working more reliably. 1/2017 Samsung Galaxy s6. Be prepared to spend over one hundred dollars for bulky squares that seldom pick up your phone's Bluetooth, thus defeating the purpose of the app. I had really wanted it to work because losing things is a tremendous problem. But Tile does not help you find them because it rarely works, showing most of your Tiles as \"out of range\" most of the time. I'd encourage the tile team to test more thoroughly."}

Fortunately did not invest a dime in this garbage as I got a couple of tiles at a tradeshow for free. First, the pairing is glitchy as only the first tile wanted to pair. Supposedly only way to remedy it is to turn phone off for 2 minutes. Doesn't do a thing. On a hunch I took one of the tiles apart against the advice of the support site (\"void warranty, risk of electric shock\"), bah! fat chance of that with the standard CR2032 coin cell powering it! You might as well have tried to convince us you hid an alligator inside too! The powercell was micro spot welded to a metal strip connected to the circuit board. I wanted to see what the tile would do when it lost power. Ripped said metal strip off the battery with a pair of pliers, then reconnected the cell.. And wouldn't you know it, the tile paired like a charm (no user serviceable parts inside, huh?) Only downside; the casing was done for, as its ridiculously hard to open (no match for a thin hacksaw blade and a little patience). I managed to find a new key chain case for it, but only because I stubbornly refused to let it go to waste. All in all it feels like these things are made to buy and throw away, which grinds my lifehacker gears. Make a version with replaceable battery, and allow me to factory reset my tiles without having to McGyver them, then I'll try them again. Thanks for playing."}

The support team was not very helpful indicating that my Tile was connected. At that particular moment it was, but they didn't address the issue of the app being unable to connect to the Tile for several hours throughout the day. The answer given was the Bluetooth connection must not be stable and it can take up to 2 minutes for the Tile to reconnect to the app once it is in range. Untrue!
