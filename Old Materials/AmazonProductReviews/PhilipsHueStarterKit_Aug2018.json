Just got off the phone with Philips Hue Warranty because we bought the whole system last Christmas as a gift and a few months later, a bulb randomly stopped working. The Philips rep said if these are put on a dimmer switch they will burn out quickly or just won't work at all, and they do NOT warranty anything that has ever been on a dimmer switch. Rep said it clearly states no dimmers on the packaging, but I did not notice it and do not see it noted anywhere else here, so I thought I would let consumers know beforehand. Risky if you plan on putting these on a dimmer. The system and bulbs are extremely pricey so constantly replacing bulbs would be a small fortune, wasteful and terrible for the environment."}

Very little tech support online and the basic guidelines they provide don't help at all (assuming you can read ChineseEnglish - \"turn on bulb main and make work\"). I'm pretty tech savvy but this is ridiculous. These bulbs require a separate hub that you need to connect with the short wire they provide to your router, and then they say your router will interfere with the signal if the hub is too close and your bulbs won't link up. Changing Zigbee channels was a waste of time.\n\nBuy bulbs that don't require a dedicated hub instead of these."}

I jumped at the chance as I have a number of Alexa products in my home and I thought this would be a neat addition. I am 76 years old and I usually have no problem setting anything up. I read over the leaflet that that came with the kit and went online to get more information. It took less than 15 minutes for the whole process and the product works flawlessly. I will be getting more lights in the near future, I will the only thing that I don\u2019t care for is that I wish the lights were brighter. They are the more yellowish cast and I do like the brighter lights. It is very comforting to know that I can wake up in the morning and tell Alexa to turn on my kitchen light and turn off my Living room light. I have my Living room light on all night, however I do them at very low and use it as a night light. I can\u2019t wait for what they bring in the near future, just love all this stuff.\nReading the reviews of the Phillips Hue light bulbs, it seems that customers do not always read the product description completely,and miss the fact that a hub is needed to use the properties of the bulb"}

{"Author": "N. Creel", "Date": "on August 17, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A stupid smart light", "Text": "Do not buy these lights! These lights are good in theory but they are not ready for prime time in the slightest. The main gripe I have is that you cannot use your actual light switch to use these lights in the way you likely want to. For example, say you want a nice blue tinted light in your room rather than the more yellow tint the bulb gives off when you first put in in. Too bad. Seriously, turning the light off with your light switch automatically resets the color back to the standard yellow rather than the color you took the time to set it to. The only work around are to 1) use the app to turn your lights on and off (cumbersome and unintuitive) or 2) to buy their light switch (which, if you ever accidentally use your real light switch to turn the lights off, still means you must use the app to get them back to the color you desired. That\u2019s ridiculously stupid for a \u2018\u2019smart\u2019\u2019 light."}

Got my dimmer/bulb kit today and as I installed and configured it i was reminded of some of what I consider sugnificant short comings of this whole sytem.\nFor those who want a basic smart light system, Philips Hue is a good choice. For those of us who want more control, not so much.\nFirst, you can't install anything until you set up at least one room.\nSecond, as you set up scenes, you cannot remove bulbs in a room from a scene. You can turn unwanted bulbs off in a scene, but then whenever you execute that scene those other bulbs will go off even if that was not your desire. Example: I now have 5 Hue bulbs in my bedroom. One in my nightstand; one in a wall fixture and three in the ceiling fan fixture. If I have the nightstand and the wall lights on and decide to turn the ceiling fan lights on, the other lights go off.\nThird, no facility in Hue to set up groups - only rooms - and bulbs cannot exist in more than one room.\nPhilips, please address these limitations."}

These things are great for all kinds of uses, and I have even purchased additional bulbs since purchasing this starter pack.\n\nFirst off, these lights are not WET RATED, but I have taken the risk of putting them in each of my porch lights. So far my experience has been good, but it has rained very little since install. Using the Hue app, I was able to set the lights to automatically turn on at sunset and off at sunrise, which is something I struggle with. I remember to turn the porch lights on at bed, but forget to turn them off when I wake. These do it for me, which is great.\n\nI also placed on in my hallway to use as a nightlight. The brightness can adjust from 1% - 100% from the app or via Alexa, and it's a great night light replacement. My kids prefer this light over a traditional nightlight due to the light that it emits over an entire area versus a small area against a wall.\n\nThe lights are soft white, so not overpowering, but they're pretty bright. They look great on the porches and are a great addition to my smart home.\n\nThe setup of the hub is easy, and it's even easier to set it up with Alexa! It's easy to then control your lights from your phone, through Alexa, and even Xfinity Home application if you have Home Security."}

They were not. Some devices have instructions like, \"Alexa, tell Acmehub to turn on hallway lights\" - it's not like that. The command is \"Alexa, turn on hallway lights.\"\nI was pleased to see that no other dimmer device is required. I presumed incorrectly that I would need the Phillips Hue dimmer. But Alexa does it without a separate dimmer: Just say, \"Alexa, dim hallway lights\""}

Seamless setup, easy to use, works great with Alexa.", "Text": "I was kind of worried about purchasing these. I was afraid they would be overly complicated to set up and be a pain to set up with Alexa. I am a tech savvy person, but some of these smart home systems are just not set up well.\n\nSo I was pleasantly surprised that I got all of this up and running under ten minutes! Just to help anyone out who needs clarification....you need the hub to be able to use the lightbulbs with Alexa (or whichever digital assistant). You just plug that into your router, then set up the Hue app on your phone and the Alexa app to connect it. It's actually surprisingly simple. Alexa understands me and the commands very easily without issue....extremely happy with this purchase!\n\nCreating a smart home used to be for billionaires like Bill Gates....now it's affordable and useful enough to be a good fit for everyone! It's very nice to be able to on and off lights with just your voice and app and not having to move."}

I'm talking about less than 2 ft away here. Then, when trying to set up the light bulbs it insisted on assigning all 4 bulbs to the same room! I assumed I had downloaded the incorrect app, so I deleted it. But then a quick search on the internet showed that I did have the correct app so I downloaded it a second time. However, after installing the app a second time it could not find the Hue Bridge no matter how close I was standing to it with my phone.

It seems like purely a financial play that Philips has integrated the \"smartness\" into the most disposable aspect of your smart home. It would be so much more economical to have smart switches instead of smart bulbs. With regular light switches, you have to leave them on all the time. If you leave them off, the bulbs don't work because they don't have power. If you leave them on, you have to take out your phone, open an app, and manage them that way.\nThere are add-on switch/remotes, but these are another $25 on top of the $15 bulb, and they don't replace your switch. And they take batteries.\nYou can use Amazon Echo or Google Home to control the lights, but do you put a smart speaker in every room? Even if you did, this is where one of my less-philosophical problems comes in. I'm a Google Home/Assistant and Google WiFi user. It's been a phenomenal pain to try and keep Google updated on my lights. I have to tell it to re-sync devices any time there's a change. Google WiFi's on.here feature still only shows half my bulbs. Don't know why. Can't fix it.\nIt's worth noting that I can't give the bulbs sane nicknames, either. I had to configure my kids' rooms as \"Attic\" and \"Shed,\" because I couldn't get custom names to work, and if I set them to \"Bedroom\" they all go at once. This is a Google problem, not a Philips problem. But you should be aware. I don't know if Amazon Echo handles this better."}

I don't do a ton of phone apps typically, but I can use them for work purposes. I found these bulbs fairly easy to set up, but a little frustrating when integrating with the apps. I have a smartthings hub, and wasn't entirely sure what I was doing. There was a lot of trial and error involved, and several times unplugging/plugging back in the vue hub and smart things hub. Finally, I had everything working - the bulbs were detected on both devices and I set a timer for them. Then, I left the home. Looked at the apps and both said the bulbs/controls were not available because I wasn't at home. I looked online and saw that I need to do something else in order to use it away from home. I have to admit, I don't really NEED to turn lights on and off when I'm away, but I'd like to be able to because it just seems like something you should be able to do. I am a bit afraid to go messing with it all again after I got it working. Here's the 1 big problem that I have with the smart bulbs in general... you have to leave the lightswitch on. So, the light is off, but the switch has to be on to power it. How do you turn it on then? You use the app on your phone... Or tell alexa to turn it on. I feel silly yelling for a computer to turn the light on instead of being able to flip a switch. I don't want to have to use my phone just to turn the light on. They have switched that you can buy. I don't know. I like these for automating the porch and garage lights, especially because you cab srt them to vary the time they turn on around when you want them to (makes it not obvious that theyre on a timer), but not as much in the house. I want to still be able to use my regular switch. Something I didn't think about when purchasing."}

Lights are bright at 100%, and dimming them helps set the right mood for any occasion. The Hue App is probably the weak link in the entire thing. The geo-fencing within the app for the \"home/Away\" settings doesn't always work right(sometimes I come home and the bedroom light is still off, yet its set to come on at 20%). The \"wake up\" function though is amazing, and really helps me get up in the morning, subtly. Need to buy a few more sets to finish off the rest of the house, hoping the price comes down a little before then."}

For many years, I have preached that. Be environmentally friendly! Chose light temperatures (colors) that are relaxing and pleasing. And, yet, somehow I survived the horrors of florescent lights and compact florescent lights. Lights in the 2000K to 3000K range are considered \"warm white\" and much like what we had with old-school incandescent lights. Personally, I consider 2700K to be a good light color for my home.\n\nPhilips has warmed the cockles of my heart. In a \"playing-with-home-automation\" binge, I ordered this starter kit. I wanted something that would integrate well with other home automation systems and would be expandable.\n\nThis was easy to set up. The hub can control up to 50 Philips light bulbs. Each can be programmed with different scenes, on / off times, randomization, and brightness levels. A few hours after opening the box and playing with this, I had ordered 4 more sets for friends and family members. They all love these, too. And, I ordered some color bulbs as well.\n\nThe color temperature for these lights is pleasing and comfortable. The features are excellent. I'm very pleased with this purchase."}

{"Author": "DaytonaDan", "Date": "on March 19, 2018", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Pricey but useful. Best if you already have voice control device.", "Text": "If you havent made the jump to smart lights there are a couple of things you need to be aware of. 1. They are very expensive compared to regular old LEDs. 2. I would not bother unless I have Amazon Alexa or some other smart voice device in place to turn them off and on. Because otherwise you always have to use your cell phone and launch the app to do that, which is a huge pain (unless you use the lamp or wall switch, which sort of defeats the purpose of having smart lights). That said, there are good reasons to have them.\nI like they can be programmed to go on at sunset (regardless of when that is) and then off a certain time later. I like you can group them by room and then turn them off and on by voice by room or all at once if you want (Alexa, ALL lights off). I light you can have them start dim and slowly brighten at sunset determine how quickly it reaches full brightness. (or do the same thing at any time you want to get up in the morning).\nThis four bulb set provides the best bang for the buck if this is your first foray into smart lights since individual bulbs generally cost at least $15 to $20 (much more for color). So you are getting the hub, which costs about $50, for almost nothing.\nBe aware there are three kinds of Hue bulbs. The ones that come with this set are just plain old dimmable warm whites. Like the old incandescents. If you want more control of the shade of white (ie, daylight or cool white instead of warm white.) you need the white ambiance bulbs, which are more expensive. Bulbs that can do any color are the third type and cost more than twice as much as regular warm whites.\nOne downside to smart lights. If programmed to go on and off, the light switches must always be set to on. That's fine, unless you get lots of power outages. Because when power comes back on, light lose programming and just come on to full brightness (unpleasant in the middle of the night). and cannot be turned off via Alexa or phone app until your internet comes back up and all devices reconnect."}

I live alone and there have just been too many times that I've returned home at the end of my day only to realize that I'd accidentally left one or more lights on all day. There have also been those times that I've been away from my home for several days while traveling and kept certain lights on in my home the entire time as a (hopeful) theft deterrent.\n\nThis kit was a great start for me because it makes a big difference in terms of convenience and requires very little effort. Now, certain lights in my home turn on and off on a set schedule. No more having to remember whether I turned off all the lights after leaving for work each morning. It's also very handy how I can control my lights while away from home. There have just been a couple hiccups I've noticed so far:\n\n1. There have been a couple times that (while not connected to my home WiFi on my phone) that the Hue app has shown that a light was on when it was actually off (and vice versa). Hopefully this bug can be crushed in a future software update.\n\n2. I have two lights for my driveway that are both set to turn on and off at sunrise and sundown each day. However, I just so happened to check the status of each smart bulb in my home one night only to realize that one of the lights in my driveway was on but the other was off. I'm not sure why this would happen since both lights are part of a \"room\" and the schedule pattern is for the entire room, not just each individual light. It's not as though I check the status of my bulbs in the Hue app every night so I'm hoping that this was just a rare fluke.\n\nAll in all, I'm very pleased with the bridge and the bulbs as it has definitely brought a certain level of convenience and peace of mind for me. I've always been in the habit of turning off lights before leaving a room. It's definitely an adjustment for me to keep in mind that the wall light switches have to remain in the ON position in order for the smart bulbs to do their thing LoL. Other than that, I'm loving these things!"}

I like that I can also control the lights when I am not home with the Hue app. I was disappointed, however, because it was not clear to me that these lights are not the white-balance shifting lights. I wanted the lights that can go from tungsten to daylight-balance (or around 3200K to 5600K) and bought these thinking they could change white-balance. They can't, they are only dimmable lights that are closer to 3200K.

The one and only thing that has frustrated me with it is that most of your lighting in your house is controlled by a switch of some sort, either a wall switch or a lamp switch. If that switch gets turned off then your ability to turn that light on or off using the app is no longer available. I have several people living in my home and most of them don't care to install the app so that they can control the lights via the app, so they look to the normal way that you turn on and off lights, via the switch. They get frustrated when the light is off and the switch is on, I get frustrated when the switch is off (and I can no longer control my lighting). This probably isn't a problem when you live alone or with other people that are as interested in Smart lighting as you are!! Hue does offer a switch that you can use as a physical device to turn selected Hue lights off and on (or dim them), and it works as expected, however, it is not made to physically replace the wall switch (fit into the switch box). Clever folks remove the physical wall switch and then use double sided sticky tape to stick the Hue switch onto the switch plate where the old switch was. This is an OK solution, but frankly I would rather have normal (looking) switches that will allow people in my home to physically turn lights on or off like normal but still allow me to use the app to control lighting. That is my next project. :)"}

The bulbs are bright, dim well, and the system is responsive with Google Home.", "Text": "I'm loving these dimmable smart LEDs. Having the capability to set schedules as well as gradually brighten in the morning or dim at night is fantastic. The hub was fairly easy to set up. One tip: make sure to have all of the bulbs powered on and configured in the Hue app before attempting to set them up in Google Home. I started with one to try it out and when I added more, I had to uninstall the app and reinstall to get Home to recognize the new bulbs. It was only a minor inconvenience though and I haven't had a single problem since setup.\n\nI have my Phillips Hue system set up with google home and it works really well. Turning the lights on and off with voice commands while on the couch or in bed seems like a lazy indulgence, but it is actually very handy. Google Home/Phillips Hue also work well together for percentage dimming and color change commands."}

And once it is all setup and you have the \"rooms\" designated the way you want it just works every time. Then pairing them up with an Echo, Siri, or Google Home was easy enough and then the lights are only limited by how well your voice assistant responds to you.\nI really hope they last as long as they say they do though since they aren't cheap."}

Having some on the old school timers we decided to switch to some smart bulbs. Since we have a multi ecosystem house. Android, iOS, Nest and Google Home we needed something that would work across all platforms. The Philips Hue system seemed to fit the bill.\n\nPros:\n1. Works across all platforms.\n2. Works with Nest so you geo fencing rules apply.\n3. Homekit setup was easy.\n4. White A19 lights provide a nice soft light.\n5. A19 White bulbs aren't that expensive.\n6. System works well. No crashes.\n7. Hue Bridge is small and unobtrusive.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Any bulbs other than white cost a small fortune.\n2. Hue App can be a pain to set up across devices.\n3. More an issue with Google Home. It's integration with Hue stinks!\n\nFinal thoughts. There are cheaper alternatives to the Philips Hue system. Now that we've been running this for a while we may venture out and see what's out there but overall the Hue system has been easy to set up and use. Especially given our Frankenstein house of devices! No issues or hiccups across the board. If you add a value to the ease and convenience of the setup and maintenance of the Hue system I guess it's not that far from the others at least in the white light department!"}

I purchased two bulbs at a local retail store to just try out the well-known Philips Hue bulbs. I was under the impression that all I needed was some sort of smart hub to control the bulbs. I was surprised to see that a separate hub, Hue Bridge, was required and immediately order this starter kit. I did not read any of the requirements and just purchased it due to wanting to enjoy controlling my lights with my voice and IFTTT.\n\nWhen the kit arrived, I was surprised again to notice that the Hue Bridge requires an ethernet cable that needs to be connected to a router due to the Hue Bridge not having it's own wireless system. Due to the area that I live in, my home WiFi consists of protable Mifi cards through my phone service. This was a huge disappointment and entirely my fault. I have seen reviews and hints that you can attach a router without internet and it will work fine through the app but I have no figured it out. I was able to get the system to work briefly by turning my laptop into a wireless router and attaching the router to my laptop and attaching the Hue Bridge to my router...it sounds terrible but worked briefly. For those few moments of the system working, it worked relatively well. I have since ordered a device that will receive wireless connection through an ethernet cable and will update this review once it is working.\n\nUpdate: I found a system that allows it to function with wireless only. This system works flawlessly. I love being able to turn off all the lights in my house with just my voice/app. I would recommend it to anyone if they asked."}

Out of the box set up was simple and easy. You simply put the bulbs in the lights, turn them on, connect the hub to the power and ethernet and open the app. Everything is simple and straightforward. To connect it to the Alexa I downloaded the \"skill\" and Alexa immediately found all of the bulbs and group I had setup.\n\nHad a little frustration with Alexa claiming I had \"several\" devices with the same name--despite only having one with that name, but I renamed the ones it had a problem with. I was impressed, dimming lights, turning them off and on in groups and individually, the family was impressed. It worked GREAT-----FOR ABOUT 3 HOURS!! Then the Hue hub went offline. Alexa said \"the Hue hub is not responding\". So I checked everything and sure enough the Hue hub would not connect to the internet through the Hue app. This is especially perplexing as it is CONNECTED with an ETHERNET cable, not WIFI (and for your information it CANNOT connect with WIFI). How does a device plugged directly into the router lose a hardwired connection? So now I apparently have to start over again with a full reset. So I'm guessing this will be a bust, but Ill update later.\n\nCannot give more than 2 stars at $80.00 for 4 \"dumb\" LED bulbs I could get for $2.00 each. Kinda pricey LED bulbs. I will be returning it if it goes offline again and going with the plugs to see if those work.\n\nUPDATE When I got home from work the Hue was back online and working. So at this point everything is functioning as it should.\n\nUPDATE again....back to no connection to the hue. At this point it does work about 70% of the time. But it is very unreliable at best. Not sure why it disconnects itself randomly but it does. Usually corrects itself but very frustrating."}

They animate smoothly when turning on, off, high, or low. It looks cool.\n\nThe color is great, the usability is great. I didn't want to like these as much as I do, but they really are the best smart lighting system I've seen."}

If anything, they're a little too strong, but after getting them set up with my Amazon Echo, I can easily turn them on, off, or dim them as needed. The over all process wasn't too terrible and they work well, but I subtracted stars because the setup process involves an unnecessary step of creating an account with \"meethue.com\". I also had a lot of trouble getting the lights to be recognized when Alexa scans for them. Even though I'm mashing the \"hub\" button, it took several tries (20 second wait time each) before it finally saw them all.\n\nI was unable to finish the setup before having to provide information to Philips that's none of their business and making a connection online for a product that should run and operate entirely offline. I've sent them a support request and a question here on Amazon to confirm whether the account is actually required and WHY, but neither got a response.\n\nI deleted my account today and the lamps still work so I've solved part of the problem, but I'm still left to wonder what information they're collecting based on my products, usage, and the network it's attached to. I don't honestly believe they're doing anything too terrible, but it's the uncertainty - the abuse of my trust that caused me to subtract three stars."}

{"Author": "Shere", "Date": "on January 13, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Could be great, for a price", "Text": "Below is posted my review that was the top-rated critical review on the previous listing for this product, before Philips decided to delete the listing and re-post it. I am still using the bulbs and have been gifted a few more, but all of the following rings absolutely true even over a year later:\n\nThese things are neat.\n\nThat's really the sum of the entire smart home automation experience, which the Phillips Hue is a microcosm of.\n\nRealistically speaking there are two avenues of approach with regards to smart lighting. You can either install smart switches, which would in turn control all of the bulbs connected to that switch. Or you can go for smart bulbs, which are a more individual approach. There are pros and cons to each method, but I won't get into that debate here. This is about the smart bulbs and bridge listed here.\n\nFirst of all, these bulbs are the white spectrum dimmer bulbs in the Hue set. They don't do colors, but a small range of warm-white intensities on a dimmer spectrum.\n\nThe app for controlling the bulbs is firmly \"okay\". It offers things like bulb grouping (for designating rooms, mainly), time programming (turn the lights on to 25% at 5:30pm, for the cat :3), and location/proximity triggers (when you detect my phone is nearby, turn the lights on. When I leave, turn them off). It does this through a somewhat clunky, inflexible UI that obfuscates things behind layered menus. It's sometimes hard to figure out where you are in the app, or if what you just programmed has been truly set up. The one thing the app does right is that it offers a master on/off switch for all of your bulbs at the top no matter where you are in it.\n\nAlexa integration is great, and should be a primary decider for you in this purchase. Alexa lets you name bulb groups and do simple commands for the lights i.e. \"Alexa, dim the bedroom to 50%\" or similar. If you already have Alexa coverage in the room(s) you intend to use these in, it's great. It really feels like we're living in the future.\n\nThe main rub with these bulbs is that they require the socket they're in to always be \"on\". This makes them ideal for lamps, since those are always plugged in anyway and benefit well from both individual control and grouping. They still work okay for permanent fixtures and sockets, but with some catches that I'll get to next. If the source for the bulb is turned off and then back on, the bulb will behave as a normal lightbulb. The obvious issue with this will be evident should you ever lose power - when power is restored all of your smart bulbs will be on.\n\nAnother detriment, one that seems to be a sort of side-effect behavior is that, since the bulbs are controlled by an app that lives on one person's phone, if you don't have any secondary control schemes then people will just avoid using the lights at all. Worse still, they'll wind up flipping a switch twice as much to accomplish what normal bulbs used to, and as a bonus interrupt your current programming.\n\nEven myself, if I don't have my phone on me at all times, then what is included in this package is basically objectively less useful than a real lightbulb. Of course, Phillips is all too happy to sell you programmable switches, motion detectors, or offer up the Amazon Dot as a solution. Note that none of these things comes in under $35. Each.\n\nIf I had to make a closing statement, to cease my rambling, it's this:\n\nThis is a good product that could be a great product if you're willing to go all-in and deck it out with the whole nine yards, and kit out your whole home to support them. There are things that I could envision doing with the Hue switches, color bulbs, motion detectors, voice commands etc. that could come out being really awesome and simultaneously more expensive than I can justify all at once.\n\nedit: Here's where I make a 1 year addendum to the above:\n\n1. The app has never improved or changed in any significant way. Using the actual app for these bulbs isn't impossible, but they really don't expect it to be a primary control mechanism.\n\n2. Voice commands are the main driver here. If you have an android phone, you can use \"Ok Google\" voice assistant, and/or if you have any of the Echo devices those work too (but separately, which is annoying having to mirror bulb names).\n\n3. This kit is meant to frustrate you into buying more, honestly. The price tag is misleading - you need at least a smart phone (which is non-static, personal, and follows you around) or an Echo ($30+++ purchase, static so other people can use it too) to make any use of these. You will not get any mileage out of using these only with the app.\n\nAll told this is a several hundred dollar purchase disguised as a $50-60 one. It's a loss leader. I like it, but it irks me that their starter kit doesn't come with at least an Echo dot or something."}

Having older parents who don\u2019t have smartphones and are happy with Kindle Fire tablets, this purchase was not a good one. I have installed the Hue app on my iPhone and set up their lights at this point, but the developers should look into having an app that is compatible with the Kindle Fire or Amazon should consider the products they market that will not work with their own smart devices.

Being able to dim them is nice too - I'm sure will be useful too. Being able to schedule them going on and off will be good too. The controls are easy to use, both in my phone and with the Dot. It was easy to get it all working together once I got the app and signed up. No more plugging and unplugging (for the attic, where I had to plug the light in before going up or could hurt myself in the dark), or having to use a dimmer slider.\n\nAlso, you can add bulbs to the system without having to do much, which is really nice. I'm looking into adding some daylight ones.\n\nCons: I do NOT like the warm white color. I prefer the daylight light, and have always looked for that in LED bulbs (used to look for it with the old incandescent ones too once I saw grow lights which were daylight lights). The warm white always looks greenish to me, and the yellow seems sickly. I'm just not fond of it. It's also harder for me to see things with the warm white.\n\nI'm hoping I can find bulbs that are compatible with this to just add to the places where I want daylight bulbs, so I can have them for reading and other things where I want better color rendition and it's easier to see things with a whiter light.\n\nNote: I should mention that color blindness runs in my family, so I may be seeing more colors than most people do because I'm female. Female relatives of color blind men sometimes see a broader range of colors compared to normal color vision. So, it may look just fine to pretty much everyone else."}

I wanted to be able to custom control my lights and this seemed like the simplest solution. I don't have any home assistants, but I can see the appeal of using this with a home assistant if you have one. You could always have the light on and turn off the switch, but then the connection is lost.\n\nFirst, setup is incredibly simple. I plugged the bridge into my router via the ethernet cable it comes with and then plugged the power cord in. It takes a moment to connect, and then you follow the steps on the app. You basically just hit buttons on the app a few times, and i goes through. I skipped an home assistant setup, but that can be part of the setup process if you have alexa or another assistant. It does appear to be compatible with alexa per other reviews, if that's what you're looking for.\n\nSecond, these bulbs are very easy to use. The app is very simple and straightforward. I have explored setting up routines, so I'll probably update this review if they don't seem to work.\n\nSo far, they have maintained a great connection. They have a standard setting, but you can also dim the lights and adjust to perfect brightness. I really like this as I like to have a light on while watching a movie but don't like the glare from the standard wattage. This is a very simple and energy efficient upgrade for your home."}

I had spent an afternoon trying to get bulbs to pair to the system, with no luck. So I figured it would probably take an hour or more to get the Philips Hue kit set up.\n\nIt took ten minutes. First, I downloaded the Philips Hue app to my iPhone, and the app guided me through the setup.The bridge (which acts as a hub for Philips Hue bulbs) plugs into your router and into power. Once it powered up, the app found it on my home network and gave me an option to scan an accessory for use with Apple HomeKit. I wasn't sure what they meant by 'accessory'--after a couple of minutes, I figured out that the app wanted me to scan a code on the bottom of the bridge. I hit the 'Scan' button, and pointed the phone's camera at the bottom of the bridge. It picked up the code immediately and registered the bridge in Apple HomeKit.\n\nThe really pleasant surprise was that all four bulbs supplied with the unit were already pre-paired to the bridge. No setup at all required on the included bulbs. After my last experience, that was a real plus for me.\n\nIt took a minute to figure out which bulb was #1, which was #2, and so on, but once I did that, it was a simple matter of screwing the bulbs into the lamps that I wanted to use them in. Apple's Home app, which controls HomeKit devices, was a little harder to figure out--it isn't Apple's best-designed app. But once I had the bulb assigned to the rooms they are in, I was able to use Siri to turn lights in each room on and off, and to dim them.\n\nIt may not quite rise to the level of \"It just works\", but the Philips Hue is the closest gadget to that standard that I've set up in a while. I can recommend this kit without reservation for use with Apple HomeKit.\n\n01/01/2018: I've had these bulbs for several weeks now, and I continue to be pleased with them. We've had one power outage, and a visit from my old-school sister, who would only use the hard switch to turn lights on and off. Through it all, the bulbs have maintained sync with the hub--no resets necessary. I noticed some flicker in one of the bulbs, but it was the result of a fixture-dimmer not being turned all the way up. So far, so good."}

I have set them up to be controlled through the echo dot.

About 45 minutes set up time is worth it for the freedom they offer. And the end to the get up out of bed and turn the lights off game that my wife and I used to play is worth every penny."}

{"Author": "Griffen", "Date": "on December 15, 2017", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Not recommended for main lights.", "Text": "The Philips Hue smart light system works most of the time. The main reason I purchased these smart lights was to use the sunrise wake up feature because I get up very early. That feature of the system has worked very well for me and has definitely helped me become a morning person and avoid being late to work. Aside from the sunrise function, the smart lights are just less convenient to use as primary lights for a bedroom compared to regular \"dumb\" lights on a switch. To turn the Philips Hue lights on and off, you either have to use the mobile app or use the location control based on your phone's gps. I have the location control turned on, so my lights should come on when I get home and turn off when I leave. The location control is frustratingly unreliable. It works about half of the time, and the other half of the time, I have to fumble around in the dark to get my phone out to turn the lights on. It would be much easier to just use a switch on the wall. In addition, since the lights connect over wifi, the connection is not always perfect, and sometimes there is a significant delay between the time I turn the lights on from my app and when they actually come on. For me, it would make much more sense to use the Philips Hue lights in a bedside lamp or secondary light, but I think they would be less of a hassle if you also integrated a smart switch, amazon echo, or other smart devices that would make turning the lights on and off more reliable. I was also excited about having the ability to set the brightness level of my lights, but I have found that I really don't use different brightness levels. I found a level that works well for the room, and I pretty much leave it there. Overall, I really don't think that these lights are a good replacement for normal switch driven lights."}

I am still having issues sharing my Home settings to my wife but that isn't a problem with Philips Hue. I do think to call it a \"Smart\" bulb... it could be a lot smarter. Anytime I have to Google how to get something to work I tend to get irritated. If you asked me the first hour I opened it I was pretty upset. But, after some research I got it all setup and working. It is so cool to be able to dim the entire house to 1% at bedtime. I will order bulbs for the rest of the house.

For example, a WEMO smart plug connects wireless to your internet, then is controllable via internet while away from your home - no hub necessary. In order for Hue lights to function, you must buy this overpriced hub (e.g. you can buy an internet modem/router for the same price). Then to make this work via internet, you must have some other device capable of controlling your lights via internet. In my case it's an iPad with the Home app but the iPad must remain in the home or I'm unable to control the lights when away. Or if you have an Apple TV (3rd gen or 4K) you can use this as well. From there you control the lights using your smart phone with the Home app. So the question is, why couldn't they just make bulbs that are capable of connecting wireless without the need of the hub? Seems like a good way to get you to waste $$ buying unnecessary products.\n**UPDATE** - Unable to connect via the internet using the Hue App. If using the Apple Home app things work flawlessly. But like I said, this requires Apple TV or another device in the home to communicate to the hub."}

I am also quite technical. When a cyber Monday sale showed these at such a lower price, I grabbed 2 and was quite excited. Two issues. 1. The information from Philips for this listing showed COLOR which was what I was interested in. I would not have bought it for just white (which is what I got) The second piece is that the lack of instructions in the box. Because this was two starter kits it came with two hubs, each hub was paired with the bulbs it came with but I had to go online to find that I did not need to setup up both hubs to control the lights and the information on how to add lights is hard to find. Not at all thrilled. Now I can't get the color bulbs at cyber Monday prices and I have 8 white bulbs that I am not sure what to do with.

Install the bulbs, set the light switches to on, plug in the hub, download the app, sync and done.\n\n3) Works with Amazon Echo Dot (some times).\n\n4) Ability to dim my lights without having to install a dimmer switch. Can set any brightness I like depending on mood or any occasion.\n\n5) Can set schedules of when to turn on and off lights based on geographical location and time zone. Cool little part of the app.\n\n6) Geofencing: Can detect when you're home or away and turn on/off lights as needed or requested.\n\nOk, now that I've gone through the good, now time for the cons. There are only a few, but to me they severely outweigh the good. The reason for home automation is so that I can control my devices effortlessly, whether I'm home or away. That isn't really so much the case with this right now.\n\nCons:\n\n1) As soon as I get out of my home network, it's a painful experience trying to connect through the app, whether on 4G or connected to another WiFi somewhere else. Even being connected through my Google account, has issues staying connected. Can't turn my lights off after I left my house, it's aggravating.\n\n2) Amazon Echo Dot skill works about 25-30% of the time. Almost always I get the response \"Philips Hue isn't responding.\" Some times it'll work after a 30 second delay, but most times when hearing that message it does nothing. Doesn't communicate directly to hub with Amazon Echo devices. Yes, that's right. It goes through Philips instead of being integrated wirelessly through your own home network.\n\nAll in all, I probably wouldn't have bought this yet if I had known all this. Would I buy it later down the road knowing these issues would be resolved, definitely yes.\n\nBut for now, I'll continue to use it at home only and continue to mutter profane words to myself under my breath every time Alexa says she can't connect to Philips Hue..."}

The app only works if you're within your home's wifi range. Part of the reason why I wanted these is so that I could manually turn on my lights when I'm out of town (to make it look like someone's home). But the Hue app doesn't work that way.\n\nHOWEVER, there is a work around. If you have a Google Home or Google Home Mini, you can link the lights to your Google Home app and turn them on and off from there instead. You would have to say \"Hey Google, turn on my lights\" into your phone, which might look odd to a passing stranger but it does the job.\n\nAnother annoying thing is that the hub does not connect to your internet wirelessly. You have no choice but to tether the hub within the distance of the included Ethernet cable, which is about 5 feet.\n\nOne more thing that\u2019s kind of odd and, I can\u2019t prove this, but I have a hunch that the bulbs only work with specific lamp assigned numbers on the Hue app. In other words, if you have a pack of four light bulbs, each bulb must be specifically synced to a specific lamp number on the app. For example, when I screwed in the first light bulb and assigned it to White Lamp 1 on the app, it didn\u2019t work. But then I screwed in a different bulb and it worked just fine. And the first one that didn\u2019t work initially worked perfectly once I assigned it to a different lamp number on the app. I couldn't find any markings on the bulbs and there isn't anything in the instructions that bring this up, but like I said, it\u2019s just a hunch.\n\nNow for the Positives:\n\nDespite all of the aforementioned annoyances, at the end of the day, the bulbs are fantastic!\nThey work perfectly with my Google Home Mini, and they have pretty easy dimming controls.\nI linked up two lamps in my living room through Google and now all I have to say is \u201cHey Google, turn on the Green Lamp\u201d or \u201cHey Google, turn off the floor lamp\u201d or if I want all the lights in the living room on or off I just say \u201cHey Google, turn on the living room lights\u201d\nThese are a fun way to \u201csmarten\u201d up your home and they work great with the Google Home."}

I could not configure the bridge at all due to lack of Internet connection and the third light on the bridge kept blinking. To resolve this I had to change my Router's IP address to something else to restore Internet connectivity. After that I configured bridge to higher static IP Address and then revert my Router back to original 192.168.1.1 IP Address. It finally started working. I spent more than an hour to resolve this issue. Hope it helps someone. On a brighter note the Hue bulbs work great and I have connected Alexa to it.

Sure, I have the options of either the smart switches from Lustron, Sylvania but then I have to rewire some of the wall switches and replace some of the wall plates. Although it is not hard to do that, I think it is much easier to change the light bulbs instead so I don't have to running around finding the parts to replaces the wall switches. After plugging in the Hue bridge, I found that the Hue app it easy to use and set up the bridge and the lighting I wanted. Granted, the UI interface could be better as it was not obvious how I would start creating the light groups after I connected to the Hue bridge. I only wish that the Hue bridge is Wifi enable so it does not need an Ethernet port to connect. For this kit, the bridge already come connected to the two A19 bulbs so it already know them when I put them into the light sockets. For additional light, I have to manually add them as the bridge does not automatically discover them as I plug them in. I got a Hue Bloom light for mood lighting in the family room as well as a few BR30 flood lights for both the family room and kitchen areas. I also link them to Alexa app and use my Echo to control the room lights which is great after dark as I don't have to search for the light switches on the wall. The only drawback with the Philips system is the light bulb cost, the A19 cost $12.5 each in a 4 pack, the BR30 flood light cost $25 each in a 2 pack, the color version are higher at $50-60 each like the color BR30 or the Bloom. My approach is not to replace every light bulbs since I recently changing them from CFL to LED, not need to change them out. I only replace the bulbs I want to control via the Hue app or Amazon Alexa. The Hue app also allow me to set these lights to turn on/off for waking up, going to sleep or at certain time of the day so I don't really need to use the wall switch for them. This app is also working great as security lighting at home while I am away, I don't need to set the manual timers anymore."}

There is a reference within the included manual that directs you to a website, but this proved to be incredibly difficult to navigate.\n(3) THE HUB NEEDS TO BE PLUGGED INTO YOUR WIRELESS ROUTER AT ALL TIMES. Philips is very vague about this, likely because they know this may put off users. The instructions make it seem like you only need to plug the hub into your router during setup, but the hub WILL NOT WORK unless it is plugged directly into your router at all times.\n(4) The app to control the lights is not particularly user friendly and connecting the hub to the app was also difficult. You really need to be RIGHT next to the hub during the pairing process or it will not work.\n\nPros:\n(1) It is pretty convenient not having to get out of bed to turn off the lights.\n(2) The tonal quality of the bulbs is actually really really good - I would say probably the best I've seen. The bulbs are very bright but they have a beautiful natural tone.\n\nBottom line, I am not particularly impressed. I would probably return if Amazon Echo interface wasn't so amazing."}

I popped the two whites in a bathroom because I don't really need color lights in there, even if it is hilarious painting the bathroom red or turning on a super fast color loop when an unsuspecting houseguest is using it.\n\nAs for ease of setting up...wow. It should not be this difficult. The hub comes pre-loaded with the two supplied bulbs. I already own 20 Hue bulbs, plus my first gen hub. Anyway, it wants to transfer your old hub settings to your new hub, but I skipped that initially because I didn't have any more free ports in my router, and figured it's probably better to just do a clean install anyway. How naive. Second hub gets online, I go into the Hue app, search for my 20 other bulbs...and it detects none of them. Even after numerous scans. It passive aggressively floats that \"search by serial number\" option. I'm thinking to myself...are you ****ing kidding me? You want me to go remove 20 bulbs and write down all those serial numbers?\n\nSo, I unplug a cable from my router and plug both hubs in. I go with the first option of transferring my settings over. It finishes without any hitches it seems. I go into the Hue app. It's got my scenes, and 20 bulbs, but not the two new white bulbs. I search for them. It doesn't find them. Again with the \"search by serial number\" suggestion. After muttering a few choice curses. I go and unscrew those two bulbs to write their serial numbers down, enter them into the app, and it finds them just fine within seconds. Whatever terrible logic is going on in the underlying algorithm...well, it's clearly pretty terrible.\n\nNow, because I've got Amazon Echos everywhere, I run into a problem that is probably more Amazon's fault than Hue's fault, but who knows. Maybe it's both their faults. The Echos/Alexa app still have info from my previous hub. Some of that info has changed since I moved some bulbs around, and renamed a few things. I use the Alexa app to scan for new devices, and I now have both all the old and new bulbs and rooms listed in Alexa (btw, totally not Hue's fault, but it's beyond stupid how Alexa doesn't differentiate between bulbs and rooms). And, for some insane reason, you can't delete devices. You have to disable them. Now, I've got copies of many devices as a bulb named \"kitchen sink\" from the old hub, and the same bulb named \"kitchen sink\" from the new hub are both now in the Alexa app. I had to go in and experiment to determine which copies Alexa actually saw and which copies had to be disabled because they were tied to the old hub.\n\nSo, what really should have been a 3-5 minute process ended up taking half an hour of bug-eyed wonder at how bad this entire process was.\n\nWhy did I bother to upgrade to the 2nd gen hub? Was it worth it? I'm not sure. I can now tell my Echos to change bulb colors without using IFTTT triggers. I can call scenes directly, rather than tying multiple light changes to the same IFTTT trigger word. Some natural commands revolving around rooms don't have any visible effect, whereas when I had my lights set up as groups to mimic rooms in Alexa...I never had that issue. That's honestly about all that's changed. Functionality hasn't really changed (if anything, it's worse); just the verbiage. Is it worth having a zillion disabled devices tugging at my OCD whenever I look in my Alexa app's 'Smart Home' screen? I don't know."}

We are still using it but we are hoping for some fix to increase the time period that we have to keep power cycling the bridge. Any tips welcomed!"}

I would never use such a bright white light on indoor bulbs, and frankly don't know why Philips even sells this bulb for indoor, residential use. Somehow, I must have watched a video about the light settings for the Ambiance and thought it applied to these. While you can adjust the brightness, there is zero warmth for these bulbs. So if you are even moderately particular about not having cool white light bulbs in your lamps, chose carefully and get the Ambiance. To an extent, I feel like I wasted money on these because I really don't feel they are usable indoors."}

Dimmer feature is perfect when I'm awake after my wife falls asleep. Placed a few throughout my house and paired them with my Echo Dot, that was I can tell Alexa to dim the living room to 20%, have her turn all lights on/off at once or control each room via the Hue app. Initially, it seemed a little pricey to pay $15 per smart bulb, but they come with a two-year warranty and are designed to last 15 years or 15,000 hours (if I read the warranty info correctly). Which if that math is true, $15 for a dimming bulb that should last guaranteed two years is actually a good deal. Also, each bulb does work as an extender to the other bulbs from wherever your bridge is linked to your router. Setup took me about an hour but only because our router is on one end of the house and I have the 4 bulbs on the other side. So, I had to temporarily place some bulbs closer to the router in order to establish a connection with the others. I plan on putting more of these bulbs throughout most of the rooms in my house, so I will definitely be purchasing more periodically."}

{"Author": "Dean Buzzell", "Date": "on October 2, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great unboxing and setup experience!", "Text": "I wasn't in the market for wifi-enabled lights. Honestly, I always felt such devices was a bit of useless puffery. These lights, though, have changed my mind entirely.\n\nThe unboxing was simple - frustration-free packaging is always good. Included in the box are the two lights, the bridge unit, a power cord and an ethernet cable. I was a bit concerned that the instructions were literally 3 instructions - install the light bulbs and turn on the switch; plug in the bridge and connect to wifi; download the Hue app and follow the instructions. In 18 languages. Fortunately, though, the URL was on one of the pages, so I downloaded the Hue app. Surprisingly, the setup was just that simple. Before you get started, though, you should download/install the app from your device app store, and you must have an active internet connection, an open ethernet port to your network, wifi, and a power source (outlet) for the bridge.\n\n1. Install the bulbs where you intend to use them, and ensure the bulbs are turned on. I'm using mine in lamps at either end of my living room sofa.\n\n2. Attach the bridge to your network via ethernet cable. In most cases that means connecting it directly to your router, but I'm using TP-Link Powerline devices, which provide an ethernet connection at various outlets in my home, so I chose one of these locations. I do have a 9-port switch attached to my router, and could have plugged in the bridge there, but a shortage of electrical outlets made it more convenient to chose one of the Powerline ports. As soon as the bridge was powered up, three LEDs across the top quickly lit and two of them went out.\n\n3. Open the app. It'll start looking for the bridge, and find it pretty quickly. You're prompted to press the center button to begin the pairing process and light bulb setup. You're asked to create a group name for your lamps; I chose Living Room. Each lamp was placed in this group with the default name. I was NEVER going to go to the trouble of using the long default names, so I chose something more meaningful. One of my lamps looks like a Japanese Lantern, so it was named Shoji. The other looks somewhat like a beehive, so Beehive. The app made it easy to figure out which lamp was which - touch one in the app, and that lamp would blink, so light 1 became Beehive, and 2 became Shoji. That done, I registered my email address and a password to create a Hue account. Done. Tip: If you've got an Echo, Home Kit, or Google Assistant, keep individual light names simple so they're easy to remember and speak, and distinct so your Echo can clearly hear you and respond correctly.\n\nI've got an Echo too, so added the Philips Hue skill to it. That wasn't quite as intuitive as I'd hoped - the Alex app is a bit kludgey - but once I found the Hue skill installation and setup was quick. The Echo had a hard time with controlling the lights at first, but I realized that the television was too loud. I turned the sound down, and tried turning the Living Room off and back on. That worked, so I tried the individual lamps by name, and that worked flawlessly - on; off; 50%; 100%. The Echo takes just a bit of time to process the command, and the light ring at the top lights and flashes as it executes. When complete, the Echo will say \"Okay\". Certainly, though, it's quick enough\n\nI found there are two 'groups' - Home, which, I imagine, turns every Hue device attached to the bridge on or off at one time, and Living Room -\nthe group I created during setup that controls both bulbs at one time. Home has an on/off button, as does Living Room. By tapping the Living Room group, I can see the individual lamps, and can control them individually. Registering an account with Hue opens up additional options. By turning on the \"Location Aware\" function, you can get your lights to turn on (at full brightness, dimmed, or 'night light') when you come home. You can further stipulate that this happens only if you come home after sunset. You can also have the lights turn off when you leave home. As I mentioned, you must enable \"Location Aware\" to make these proximity settings work.\n\nSo, yeah. Surprised - and very pleased - sums up my unboxing and setup experience with Philips Hue lights. Now that I've got some, I'll absolutely add more. Don't know that I'll go for the colored lights and wilder stuff, but certainly the standard lights. Love the energy efficiency and cost savings from LED lamps. If you've got an Echo, you already know how easy it is to use it via voice. Being able to control lights with it is a great addition to an already invaluable tool - at least in my home it is."}

I followed the migration instructions and it worked without issue. Incidentaly, the commands to get echo to invoke scenes was not what I expected. I found that I have to say, \"Alexa, turn on cottage sunset in kitchen\" rather than 'set kitchen lights to cottage sunset' which is what I expected to work. I've not deployed the bulbs yet but have been using one that I had already in a lamp. These require the light switch to be left on so it can be a little problematic vs a smart switch but you get the color scenes."}

Bridge doesn't work with google home.", "Text": "I bought this for my desk for my high school dorm. They work perfectly. The light bulbs are bright and the bridge connects to the ethernet easily. I use Simple Designs LD1003-WHT Basic Metal Desk Lamp with Flexible Hose Neck, White with the light bulbs and they work perfectly! I really love them. The bridge also works with the hue app that is on both android and apple app store, but not all the time. Your internet connection must be perfect for no delays when changing the brightness of the lights. The internet in my dorm is really bad and I have a huge delay when I try to change the brightness of the lamps. The delay is about 2-5 seconds.\n\nThe main reason why I bought these bulbs and the bridge is because of my google home, but it doesn't work with my google home. I asked both the philips hue and google home costumer service but their feedback are not informative and basically they can't fix my problem. For some reason, my google home app on my phone can detect the philips hue bridge but can't connect to it. SO IF YOU HAVE A GOOGLE HOME, AND YOU ARE BUYING THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF GOOGLE HOME, PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING THIS PRODUCT WITH GOOGLE HOME!!!"}

{"Author": "D. R. lee", "Date": "on August 21, 2017", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Setup can be a headache", "Text": "A little misleading on ease of setup. I've had the Echo for awhile but also I bought a Dot when I bought this kit with the intention of using both to control lights. The documentation that came with the Hue kit was a folded pamphlet with the same message in 20 different languages: Screw in and turn on your lights, Hook up power and the Ethernet to the bridge and download the Hue app, but they don't give you a link to one they have tested and recommend. They don't have an app that lists all three operating systems (remember Windows?). Because the Echo is an Amazon product and due to their Kindle they went Android years ago and consequently the first app I found was in the Google play store. I was not allowed to download that app because, even though I have a Google account, I don't have any app store history (CC on file?). I gave up and went to the Windows app store and found a Phillips Hue app that was not free and downloaded that. The hub and smart bulbs don't care about your OS so why not one app compatible with any OS.\nFrom there it was just a PIA. Use your app to find and recognize and rename your bulbs but you then have to go back to the Echo and find the Phillips Hue skill and mate it with the hub. Fortunately the Echo and Dot are really user friendly so whatever you teach one, the other knows so once you have your lights named and activated they then can be controlled from either device.\nThe real problem is the Hue app. The ideal way would have been to have everything set up through the Echo skill and if you wanted remote capability get that app from your mobile device mfg. Maybe that's not ideal but what they offered was pretty lame. Amazon should make an easy setup for Alexa use only and Phillips could handle the mobile apps (including Windows). Or somebody intelligent could write a program that asked what devices you want to control and what devices you have to control with and what operating systems you want to control them with and when you've answered those questions and a couple about device( location and names) you would be all set up."}

{"Author": "Mike", "Date": "on August 11, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "The Best Alexa-Enabled Smart Lighting Solution", "Text": "I am currently in the process of outfitting my home with a number of smart products. Currently, the core \"drivers\" of my setup include Philips Hue,Logitech Harmony, Yonomi, and Amazon Alexa for voice control (via multiple Echos and Echo Dots). I purchased my Hue Starter Kit on Prime Day, and have found it to be an intelligent, smartly-designed product.\n\nThe hub itself must be plugged in to your router via a wired Ethernet connection (I know, no WiFi is a bummer). I purchased a small, CAT5e 6\" Ethernet cable so I could set this on top of my router as to not take up any more space. Once you have the power and Ethernet cables plugged in, setup is incredibly easy and super quick. The kit comes with 2 bulbs, which were immediately detected by the hub as soon as the lights were powered on. You can then add these lights to \"Rooms\" which can be controlled together simultaneously, or you can still control them individually. This product was by far the easiest device to set up so far out of all the smart home products I've purchased. I have since purchased more light bulbs as well as some Sylvania Smart+ Plugs to use with our Hue hub, and setup has been just as easy with every new item I've purchased. \"Rooms\" can even contain a mix of Hue bulbs and smart plugs.\n\nAdding the Hue skill to Alexa was also easy, and automatically imports all the lights, devices, and \"Rooms\" you have set up in the Hue app. Be careful not to name your rooms and/or devices too similarly though. Alexa had a hard time telling the difference between \"Mike's Office Lamp\" and \"Mike's Office Lights\" (for the overhead lights), but works 100% of the time when I used \"Mike's Ceiling Lights\" as the group name for the latter. This seems like a minor issue with Alexa, not with the Hue product.\n\nPROS:\n- Incredibly easy setup\n- Works with Amazon Echo devices\n- Lights are dimmable (via app, Alexa, or physical accessories)\n- Sylvania Smart+ Plug works flawlessly with this hub, despite being a 3rd party manufacturer\n\nCONS:\n- Requires a wired internet connection\n- This version of the starter kit does not come with color bulbs\n\nFor anyone looking for a smart lighting solution that works with Alexa, I highly recommend this product. Extra bulbs can be purchased in highly affordable 3-Packs, and Philips has recently expanded their Hue smart bulb line to include BR30 bulbs as well as E12 Candelabra bulbs. I am thrilled with my purchase of this product, and cannot recommend it enough."}

Just follow the directions, and if you are pairing it with Amazon Alexa, it's a dream.\n\nFirst you connect the bridge to your wireless router--this requires an email address and confirmation, so it's a bit of a pain at the start, but after that (and it comes with step-by-step instructions), it's all pretty much smooth sailing. Once you download and sign in to the Philips Hue app, Alexa finds it, no problem, so that part is easy.\n\nThe bridge itself will support up to 50 Hue lights, so it's a good initial investment. This kit comes with the bridge and two light bulbs. Once you have the bridge connected, you can tell Alexa what to call each one (living room, hallway, bathroom, bedroom, whatever), and she will turn the lights on or off and even dim them for you.\n\nYou can then say, \"Alexa, turn on the living room (or whatever) light,\" and she will. You can also tell her to dim the light (Alexa, dim the living room light). One thing I love is that you can also say, \"Alexa, turn on the living room light at 100% (or 50%, 36% or whatever),\" and she will do just that. She chirps out \"okay,\" and it's done.\n\nThis is hugely helpful if you come home at dusk or after dark with bags of groceries or are moving from room to room with your arms full of laundry or toys. No more flipping switches with your elbows, chin, or nose! Speak, and the lights will do what you want.\n\nThe bulbs themselves are connected to the hub and the descriptions you put in, so if, for example, you move a Hue bulb from the living room to the bedroom, it will still only work as the living room light until you change the designation in the app.\n\nI do think they are pretty hugely over-priced, so I won't be buying another 48 to fill up my bridge, but strategically placed and depending on your home's layout, this kit can be immensely helpful (and let's face it, it's just plain fun!)."}

In my house I have a walk in closet that has a pull string light. For years I have thought of having a wall switch put in. This would mean cuttingholes in a wall, installing a switch box, run cable up the wall into the attic and back down to the light. Not an impossible task but not one I would eagerly accept (mostly because of working in an unfinished attic).\n\nI have been researching smart lighting and how I could use it. This turned out to be both an efficient and elegant solution for my problem. I bought the white light kit and a separate switch for the job. Setting up the hub and connecting the light was easy. I set the closet as a separate room so that I could use the switch for only that light. The whole thing took a mater of minutes and cost much less then getting an electrician. So there are practical applications for smart lighting."}

I lucked out on Prime day and purchased the Deal of the Day that included the Hue Lighting Kit and Echo Dot for the price of just the Lighting Kit. I had already purchased an Echo Dot but I couldn't pass up this deal. I have since purchased an additional 7 white bulbs locally and have them in almost every lamp on my first floor. The bridge readily paired with the wifi and can accommodate up to 50 Hue devices. Although there is a bit of a learning curve, the Hue app is easy to understand and works flawlessly. Best of all, everything pairs with my echo dots. I also like that Hue recommends partner apps for added lighting benefits if needed. I did purchase a few Hue color bulbs but the novelty wore off with the first one after 24 hours. I returned them; for the price, they did not \"a designer setting create.\" I had to play around with renaming the bulbs a few times. Remember after you rename them in the Hue App you must go into the Alexa App and rediscover them each time. I've also found that the shortest and most uniform name possible is probably best and easiest to remember.\nYou have to be pretty specific when you give Alexa a command to dim or increase a bulb. So it's easier if you say:\nright or left lamp, rather than right or left bedside lamp. Also, the uniformity comes in saying lamp or light but not both. At first, I would say right lamp and then left light so both Alexa and I was confused. LOL Just start out simple and it's easy.\n\nI also purchased another popular tunable bulb that didn't require a bridge but I really don't like it. It's not as bright as hue white lights, it's longer, heavier and cost twice as much. I can't send it back because there is nothing wrong with it so I'll keep it.\n\nAgain, I just love HUE lights and in my opinion, you cannot go wrong with the HUE lighting system."}

We loved this Philips Hue system at first, but then it stopped working. More accurately: Philips intentionally disabled the system remotely and forced us to request that they mail a replacement hub / base unit. We finally got the replacement, and then had to spend about an hour setting it up. We needed to create an account online, uninstall and then reinstall apps on both our phones, and then manually enter serial numbers for several light bulbs into the app. Even then, the app had trouble finding them. One problem we still have with the Philips Hue is a significant delay between when our phones can connect with the hub and then we can start controlling the lights.\n\nThe *concept* for this system is great. Colored lights, remote operation, etc. But it's just such a huge pain in the ass, that I'm ready to throw everything in the garbage and go back to using something else. Previously, we had some simple colored LED bulbs that could be controlled by bluetooth. They were cheaper, nearly as good as the Philips system, and a lot less trouble to operate and maintain. We're worried that Philips will once again-- any time in the future-- remotely disable the lighting system rending our investment useless."}

At night you can turn them low or off without having to get up from bed. The lowest setting is a great night light. Works great with Alexa. I will say it does take a moment to set up, and figure out which app to use. I set up the bridge (a bit tough because my internet is in another room than the lights, so I had to go back a forth a little). I used the Alexa app first to set up my voice and then download the Hue app on my phone. The hue app works really well, as does the Apple Home app. You can use all three with the lights, even going from one to another. Next I'm going to get the color bulbs.

They are also less consistent from what I assume is from less powerful radios. However, the benefit in having the wifi connectivity in the lights themselves provides more flexibility. The Hue app is okay and the bridge is easy to setup. My recommendation to people is that if you are committed to going with smart lights these are a good option. I plan to purchase more of the flood light type for my kitchen when the prices drop a bit. I would like to know if these bulbs put out more heat then standard LED bulbs and if they are expected to last as long as a standard LED bulb. I hope Philips can improve on the following in the next generation of Hue bulbs. 1.) Stronger signal for better connectivity. 2.) Longer warranty to give us confidence that this combination of technology does not shorten the life of the product. 3.) Better instructions by recommending you set up one bulb at a time or figure out a way to determine which bulb is which when you hook up a bunch at once. 4.) Make it easier to name bulbs during setup. 5.) Lower the price of the BR30 floods so I don't have to wait for a reasonable price."}

You can have the lights slowly increase in brightness in the morning for a gentle wakeup, and have the alarm as a standby for emergencies rather than go from deep sleep to loud alarm instantly.\n\nI did dock the review 1 star for inconsistent connectivity issues between random lights and the hue base, or the networking of the Hue base.\nOccasionally I'll attempt to turn off all 3 lights only for 1 to stay on, or the hue app will say that it does not have a connection even when I JUST turned the lights on with it.\n\nOverall, a great product that I suggest for anyone and everyone who uses lights."}

You are supposed to have connectivity for the bulbs anywhere your WiFi signal reaches, I have not found that to be the case. I'm still playing with it so we'll see.

I bought the bridge, 27 total bulbs, and 7 dimmers. The cost was $600. First thing, the bulbs are not white, they are yellow. I had white non-smart LED bulbs already in place in my house and there was a significant difference. Not the biggest deal in the world, but I wish they disclosed that. I hooked up my bridge without a problem, I was able to easily download the Hue app on my iphone and it didn't take too long too set everything up by grouping the bulbs together in different rooms (living room, dining room, kitchen, porch, etc). The software allows each bulb to \"wink\" which identifies each bulb, which is a very nice feature. With a little patience I was able to set up all 27 bulbs and even managed to transfer the information to the 'Homekit\" app on my iphone that I was not even aware existed until this process. This allows you to control the lights from the your iphone and Siri without even going into the Hue app. The benefit to this is you can put all of the light groupings in your \"favorites\" on your iphone. You simply 'swipe up' from the bottom and they are there. This ease of software set up is the only reason why this is getting a 3 star rating and not a 1 or 2. I also set up 7 hue dimmer switches. Pretty simple process. Was able to put these dimmers anywhere I wanted. The are a small portable remote that connect to the wall plate magnetically. Very nice feature, You can turn the lights on/off and dimmer them from these devices if you do not want to use your iphone, siri, or alexa. Again, very nice. Here is my major complaint which I had no idea about. If you have any existing light fixtures hardwired to a dimmer switch, the hue lights will NOT TURN OFF. Apparently, Hue Lights do not work well with existing dimmer switches. When these are working properly, all of your existing wll switches will always be turned on. This doesn't mean that your lights will be always on. The lights will be controlled by your iphone, alexa, or Hue Dimmers. There is no reason to ever touch your existing outlets. If any of your existing light fixtures connected to a dimmer switch, you will only be able to turn them off by actually turning off the light switch, thus making the new 'smart bulbs\" completely useless. Now I have to spend more money getting 6 new non-dimming light switches for these light fixtures. It is disgraceful Hue does not prominently share this information in their product description."}

Setup was easy: just plug in the bridge, screw in the bulbs, and download the app. Takes about 5 mins to set everything up with the new updates for the bridge. For those that are confused on how this product works: you need the bridge in order to control these bulbs. You also need to be using Philip's Hue bulbs. If your bridge breaks, you can still use the bulbs normally. The electrical source of the bulbs need to be turned on in order for you to control them. For example, I'm using these bulbs in my ceiling fan. I need to have the electrical source turned on in order for me to control them with the app. You can turn the lights/bulbs off, but the electricity needs to be running. Also, if you have a ceiling fan with two sockets and you only install one of the Hue bulbs, then you might need to remove the second / normal bulb otherwise it will constantly be turned on in order for you to control just the Hue bulb.\n\nI'm giving this product four stars because lets be honest... it's pretty expensive. Also, the app could be better. It is user friendly, but some of the tabs could be condensed or removed altogether to make it simpler. The app allows you to control each individual bulb and how dim you want your bulbs. You can also setup an account or through your Google account to control the bulbs when you're away from home / not on your wifi. These bulbs are really meant for indoor use, however you can still use them outdoors. I'm guessing the lifespan of the bulbs will be a bit less if you use them outdoors due to the changing of weather. It is rated for 3 hours a day for 22.8 years or around 25k hours."}

Initially, I shrugged these lights off as a novelty that wasn't worth the price point. However, I was ignorant of the home security value of this product. You can easily set and update timers for shutting your lights on or off. It's great to be able to turn on the lights in the house before you get home.\n\nMy only issue with this project is that the app doesn't perform consistently. Often, one or two lights will become unresponsive and require troubleshooting. Phillips needs to take steps to make sure that their app is better at consistently and quickly recognizing Hue lights that have already been set up.\n\nThat being said, I have every intention to add more Hue lights to more rooms in my house. I feel like the weakness of the app will improve without having to buy new lights to reap the benefits of the update - not a lot of risk in purchasing now. If things change, I will follow up and update my review."}

{"Author": "Dave", "Date": "on May 18, 2017", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Very limited range from the Hue bridge...for starters...", "Text": "Summary:\n\nIf you are going to use this product in a small house, you will likely be okay...as long as you don't expect the Hue app from the Amazon Appstore to work with it on your Fire tablet. And your bulbs are less than 25' from the bridge.\n\nHowever, another app in the Appstore , 'all 4 Hue', written by someone who appears to be an independent developer, works quite well. (BUT, you cannot update the bridge firmware with it...it says to use the native Hue app for that...which does not work with a Fire tablet...even though it is in the Amazon Appstore...)\n\nThe nitty gritty: 1. when I kept the bulbs within 25 feet or so of the bridge, they were detected and worked fine. Alexa could also detect them. The aforementioned app could detect them. (Again, the native Hue app does not even get by the 'authorize the bridge' stage.)\n2. You cannot use a wi-fi range extender with the bridge...even if your range extender has an ethernet plug. I thought I might be able to work around the bridge range limitation with a TP-Link wi-fi range extender. Nope. The bridge *must* be hard wired (no wireless extender in the config) to the router to work.\n\nI verified both issues above with Philips tech support. She apologized for the native Hue app in the Appstore not working...she verbally stated it would not work as soon as I mentioned I was using a Fire. Same with using a wireless extender with the bridge plugged into it with an ethernet cable.\n\nAfter rooting around for a bit, I found there might be a way to have this work by using multiple Hue bulbs arranged in fairly close proximity to each other to create their own 'network' if you would. I decided against this frustration. I also checked out the reviews of the app in the Google Play store and the Apple store (wish I had done that first...my own fault of course...) and saw they were less than stellar...especially in the Google Play store...the 1 star ratings far exceeded the others. Although I am usually fairly diligent in my research, I was negligent in this detail....my bad.\n\nThese were my experiences. Fortunately, I think I may have a more limited use for this product than the one I first intended...so I shall hold on to them but certainly won't build upon this system."}

It starts with the app as it is not easy to use at all. There are no instructions on how to work with the app nor does it mention anywhere that creating an account with Phillips will give you more access to the app and products you've already purchased.\n\nThe bulbs and bridge work fine as long as you are on the same wifi as your bulbs. But if I'm on the same wifi all the time I figure it's pointless to have because I'll just get up and turn the lights on/off myself.\n\nThe widgets you can use for iOS do not work correctly or consistently. Setting your schedules for home / away for the lights to go on/off is difficult and does not work. You must also adjust your bulb brightness every time to your liking as the app does not remember your preferences. This is pointless if you're trying to use remotely.\n\nI'm extremely disappointed in the Phillips product because I don't feel they put a lot of thought into it or have made any updates to address the issues that customers have voiced their concerns about. I'll will be returning the product and purchasing something else."}

Otherwise, its too frustrating to use a phone app to control the lights.\n\nThe Good:\n* Fast and easy to setup with the Phillips Hue Mobile app for Android. Also works with the Wink app for Android.\n* Lightbulbs are of good quality and provide sufficient light for their use.\n* Works with Alexa\n\nThe Bad:\n* Unless you are using Alexa you need to use an App on your phone to turn on lighting\n* No wall switches available with Phillips system limits ability to expand beyond a few lamps.\n\nThe Phillips Hue Starter kit is a really good and inexpensive way to dip your toe into the waters of Home Lighting Automation. Overall, I really like this product and what it does, though there are some other things that really drive me crazy:\n1. The Phillips Bulbs are only worth using if you the bulbs you are replacing aren't connected to a \"room\" switch. If its easier to use the switch in the room, than to ask Alexa to turn it on, its not worth doing. For this reason, I cannot use the Hue with any lights that are attached to a wall light switch. Just not worth it for me.\n2. Using a phone app to turn on your lights is annoying. There I said it. I find it annoying. The reason I love this product is because I never actually interface with its front end app, except when I added the bulbs. Instead I use Alexa. The Phillips Hue app is actually not bad to use but... I don't want to be tied to my phone to turn on my lights.\n3. This is not a starter kit. For me to make it worthwhile, I really needed to buy an Amazon Echo Dot. This product is really incomplete without it."}

Originally I did the normal thing where I configured it directly with HomeKit and it worked perfectly.\n\nI wanted a more advanced home setup so I used a tool called Homebridge that basically mimics HomeKit support for non-HomeKit devices. It takes a Raspberry Pi and some free software, and is mostly for nerds. I figured I may as well connect it to the Homebridge gateway just to see if it would work. Indeed it did.\n\nI'm really impressed and can second pretty much every other positive review. The cost for Hue has dropped DRAMATICALLY; it's finally completely accessible for anyone with only a small amount of money to spend on home automation. It used to be an expensive product for those with lots of disposable income. I plan to get one for my Mom's birthday because (no offense to all Moms out there) it's really so easy even Mom can do it \u2026in her sleep :)"}

It's great for helpful tasks like turning lights on when you're hands are full or simple things like turning lights down when watching a movie. It's also great to be able to turn the lights on before we walk in with the app or from my office if I'm working late. The bulbs are also nice, very bright with a nice warm color & can be dimmed down very low. It's extremely simple & quick to set up and requires no maintenance whatsoever. I'm sure they'd be nice as is but using Alexa makes them much better. They are pretty expensive though once you start outfitting other rooms so that's something to think about. If you're into tech or the IOT these are a nice place to start. - If you're on a budget but want the full \"Jarvis\" effect get it with the Amazon Dot, works just fine with that."}

A Permenant Fixture in Our Home!", "Text": "I cannot say enough about how much I love my Phillips Hue lighting control system.\n\nWe bought this starter kit to try it out, and see how useful it would be. We quickly bought additional bulbs to expand it out to other rooms -- and will be buying the color lighted bulbs over the summer for our outdoor spaces.\n\nThe initial setup is fairly easy to get it going. Once you have the hub synced with the app, creating the schedules and room definitions is fairly simple. One criticism (which took a star away) is that every time you add a bulb, you have to physically touch the hub to make the bulb sync. I keep my hub hidden away and out of sight, so this is inconvenient for me to have to touch the sync button on the hub. Otherwise, the product itself is great and perfect for our home. We have bulbs in our living room, each of the kids rooms and our front porch light. All of them are on schedules -- and this REALLY helps when the kids forget to turn their lights off. Using the app is easy -- and the kids love to use the app to control the lights in their rooms. It is awesome to be able to simply schedule the front porch light to go on and off at specific times. My wife works nights, so I have the porch light scheduled to go on 20 minutes before she gets home, and go off 20 minutes after she gets home. When we aren't home, we have the living room light go on and off at specific times and the porch light does the same. You can have special schedules, or just have daily ones. Want the lights to detect when you are close to home and go on at that time? Yep, you can do that.\n\nReally a great product -- we even have it tied in to our Amazon Echo and our Apple HomeKit on our AppleTV. Can't say enough great things about this product."}

{"Author": "Just Al", "Date": "on April 5, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Home automation? Not quite ready for prime time yet.", "Text": "Bought this so that I could use Apple's Homekit to control the porch lights, as Homekit (with 4th Gen Apple TV) has the ability to create events, such as: turn lights on at sunset, turn lights off at sunrise. Neat! Or so I thought. The problem is that my front porch has 3 lights on the same circuit. The only wall switch from Phillips is battery powered, 'can be placed on the wall anywhere', (i.e. not an in wall switch) and I'm *guessing* that will only pair with a single bulb -- NOT what I need.\n\nI need in-the-wall 110v A/C switches that replace the existing in the wall switches and control an entire circuit of lights. So Apple says that Lutron Caseta dimmers ($55) were compatible with Homekit with (and \"with\" being the operative word there) the Lutron Bridge. And I've already purchased the Hue bridge, so now I need two? I suppose that I could replace all of the LED bulbs in the front porch with Phillips bulbs, but I'd kind of like to be able to control them with the wall switch sometimes, as opposed to leaving the switch on all of the time and grabbing my phone to turn them on/off manually.\n\nWhat other switches are out there that work with Homekit? Elagto Eve. (About $50). Doesn't even need a bridge. And there is the iDevices wall switch, also doesn't need a bridge (about $100 each). Both work off of WiFi?! So why buy a Hub at all? And how safe is the WiFi interface? There are several switches announced and/or coming soon that are also compatible with Homekit, but those appear to be WiFi as well. Lutron has several switches coming soon, but they'll probably require the Lutron bridge again.\n\nHere's my two cents take on all of this. Home automation isn't quite ready for prime time yet. And Phillips needs in the wall switches that replace existing 110v A/C switches. And while you're at it, how about an A/C outlet? And a device the plugs into an outlet that can be controlled by Hue? You know, for something other than Phillips lights?\n\nPhillips light bulbs are cheaper than Lutron switches, so if you want to control a lot of Phillips lights, and nothing else, Phillips Hue is a good choice for you. HOWEVER, it doesn't work reliably with Apple's Homekit. (Misses on/off events).\n\nI do have a Lutron Caseta dimmer in the house already. I bought it so that I could turn on the back porch lights from the second floor with their Pico remote -- works great. I guess I could buy the Lutron bridge ($80) and another Caseta dimmer ($55) for the front porch lights. But I've read that Lutron has compatibility problems -- will my existing switch work? And is it worth spending another $135 to turn the porch lights on at sunset and off at sunrise? (I didn't mind buying the 4th generation Apple TV, it's a big improvement over my 1st generation Apple TV).\n\nI'm disappointed that I didn't read the details about Phillips' silly and useless battery-powered wall dimmer switch before I wasted $70. Since I ordered Hue, and it works as advertised, I won't return it. But I don't currently have any use for Hue in my home."}

All those \"Routines.\" Again. From scratch.\n\nUgghhhhh.\n\nWe'll see if it works.\n\nWhat I can say, having used Alexa and Wemo too, is that the Hue app seems very poorly designed and thought out. You can't even tell a light to turn on at sunset or sunset for instance, so over the course of the year you will have to change this yourself. They do have an even less ready for prime time \"Sunset Timer\" at their Hue Labs site to add this feature in, but it's basically in beta and you're taking your changes.\n\nThis is really a pretty basic feature to have in something like this, and indicative of how the Hue app is really way more basic than it should be at this stage in its development.\n\nThe app is also very poorly thought out and designed, and, for instance, much of the time the screen keyboard on my iPhone is obstructing the poorly arranged features I need to get to and it's not always easy to get the keyboard off so I can get to the features I need.\n\nFrom how they named everything to how they arranged the screens and features, it's just not intuitive or even logical (at all).\n\nThis product still needs a lot of work, and again, all this just to turn on two of their light bulbs twice a day, and off twice a day.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAfter all this hassle, Hue insisted on sending me a replacement Bridge. And I waited and waited and it never arrived.\n\nSo I called AGAIN and it was like starting the entire explanation from scratch and there was no record of the replacement Bridge order.\n\nThey finally sent me one and when it showed up it not only wouldn't work, it wouldn't get as far as the previous one did. It couldn't even find the lights that the other one had no issue finding.\n\nNOTHING I did helped the situation and I just decided that nothing is worth this, and that the only product one should buy from Philips is a Philips Sonicare, and the only reason is because every one you order will break in less than two years and you'll a new one on warranty indefinitely. Their flossers are even worse. This is a despicable company that really isn't interested in making functional products or giving customers value for their money. It's a company run by morons and whoever they've got designing their app clearly doesn't ever have to use it, as even the most basic things are poorly thought out and totally unintuitive.\n\nAvoid this product at all costs."}

{"Author": "Shere", "Date": "on April 1, 2017", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Could be great, for a price", "Text": "These things are neat.\n\nThat's really the sum of the entire smart home automation experience, which the Phillips Hue is a microcosm of.\n\nRealistically speaking there are two avenues of approach with regards to smart lighting. You can either install smart switches, which would in turn control all of the bulbs connected to that switch. Or you can go for smart bulbs, which are a more individual approach. There are pros and cons to each method, but I won't get into that debate here. This is about the smart bulbs and bridge listed here.\n\nFirst of all, these bulbs are the white spectrum dimmer bulbs in the Hue set. They don't do colors, but a full range of white temperatures.\n\nThe app for controlling the bulbs is firmly \"okay\". It offers things like bulb grouping (for designating rooms, mainly), time programming (turn the lights on to 25% at 5:30pm, for the cat :3), and location/proximity triggers (when you detect my phone is nearby, turn the lights on. When I leave, turn them off). It does this through a somewhat clunky, inflexible UI that obfuscates things behind layered menus. It's sometimes hard to figure out where you are in the app, or if what you just programmed has been truly set up. The one thing the app does right is that it offers a master on/off switch for all of your bulbs at the top no matter where you are in it.\n\nAlexa integration is great, and should be a primary decider for you in this purchase. Alexa lets you name bulb groups and do simple commands for the lights i.e. \"Alexa, dim the bedroom to 50%\" or similar. If you already have Alexa coverage in the room(s) you intend to use these in, it's great. It really feels like we're living in the future.\n\nThe main rub with these bulbs is that they require the socket they're in to always be \"on\". This makes them ideal for lamps, since those are always plugged in anyway and benefit well from both individual control and grouping. They still work okay for permanent fixtures and sockets, but with some catches that I'll get to next. If the source for the bulb is turned off and then back on, the bulb will behave as a normal lightbulb. The obvious issue with this will be evident should you ever lose power - when power is restored all of your smart bulbs will be on.\n\nAnother detriment, one that seems to be a sort of side-effect behavior is that, since the bulbs are controlled by an app that lives on one person's phone, if you don't have any secondary control schemes then people will just avoid using the lights at all. Worse still, they'll wind up flipping a switch twice as much to accomplish what normal bulbs used to, and as a bonus interrupt your current programming.\n\nEven myself, if I don't have my phone on me at all times, then what is included in this package is basically objectively less useful than a real lightbulb. Of course, Phillips is all too happy to sell you programmable switches, motion detectors, or offer up the Amazon Dot as a solution. Note that none of these things comes in under $35. Each.\n\nIf I had to make a closing statement, to cease my rambling, it's this:\n\nThis is a good product that could be a great product if you're willing to go all-in and deck it out with the whole nine yards, and kit out your whole home to support them. There are things that I could envision doing with the Hue switches, color bulbs, motion detectors, voice commands etc. that could come out being really awesome and simultaneously more expensive than I can justify all at once."}

This is one of the rare purchases and features that makes me stop and say \"Damn, the future is now\". Out of all the smart accessories I purchased, the Hue is my favorite. It took all of 3 minutes to setup and has been working like a charm. I initially purchased the TP Link version of smart lighting, but they couldn't stay on my network for the life of them. One quick exchange later, and the Hue was here and set up. It's quick, responsive, pairs with Alexa in no time at all, and the best thing yet; it's almost endlessly upgradable (for the normal sized home, that is.) if you have been throwing the idea of automating your home around, and have a couple houndred dollars lying around (I automated pretty much everything for around $400 which includes the Amazon Dots for a few different rooms), pull the trigger. You won't regret it. Just make sure your Network has full coverage of your home to prevent frustration. Also, to anyone disappoint the hub is not WIFI based there is a reason for that. Reliability. This hub transmits the signal to all of your Hue devices. Nothing would frustrate people more than a dodgy wireless signal relaying their request to their other devices. A hardwired connection ensures every relay is transmitted correctly and appropriately. Hard wired connections may be \"ugly\" but they ensure quality transfer rates!"}

Did not have any problems getting everything set up using the All 4 HUE app which is made by someone else and not by Philips.\n\nThe app that is made by Philips does not work at all and it is the 2nd worst app I've ever used. Philips did a really bad job with the app and they should have never put it out for use. If you get this do not use the app phillips tells you to use because it will not see any philips hubs or products. Infact I don't even thick the app could find itself if it wanted to.\n\nJust download the ALL 4 HUE app and forget about the philips app. The only other complaint other than the philips app is that most of philips hue things are getting expensive and I mean ridiculously expensive. Otherwise everything works great with the bulbs and hub. Setup with Alexa and the 3rd party hue app was seemless and very nice. Watch the prices though because you could spend any where from a good reasonable price to a price almost 100$ for the same thing.\n\nI'm giving this only 3 stars because the app phillips tells you to use does not work at all. So you have to use a 3rd party app called ALL 4 HUE and for the fact that you have to really watch out because some suppliers of phillips hue things on Amazon will gouge you for sometimes 100$ more than the next supplier."}

{"Author": "Kara", "Date": "on March 12, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Waking up to a bright room before the sun has risen!", "Text": "I originally bought the Philips 455386 Hue Wireless Dimming Kit with one bulb and one wall switch, thinking the bridge was overkill for my needs. I thought I did not need to operate my lights with my smartphone, and I wanted a wall switch for guests to use. Bulb and (stick-on) switch installation was five seconds of work; they arrived synced to each other and worked perfectly.\n\nAfter a few days, though, I became obsessed with the idea of waking up to a lighted room (I consistently wake up before the sun rises). I wanted a way to have my bulbs fade on in time to my alarm. I knew this was possible with the SleepCycle app, but only if I bought the bridge. I spoke to Philips customer service about it and was very satisfied with the service I received, which convinced me to buy this product: the Philips Hue White A19 Starter Kit. (Two bulbs allowed me to connect an additional lamp and to have a spare bulb.) Best decision ever. I LOVE waking up to a bright room. Even more surprising was how much I actually DO use my smartphone to operate my bulbs. Yes, the dimming wall switch from the 455386 product is also a remote and can be removed from the wall, but I often find that I'm already sitting in bed (reading, working on my laptop, etc.) when I want to dim or turn off my bulbs, which is when the smartphone operation becomes enormously convenient. Now I can't imagine living without the bridge.\n\nThe only thing I've found lacking are the Hue app's routines, since there is no way to set a criterium for smartphone location: I only want my lights to turn on at 4:45pm every day IF my smartphone is located within 400 feet of the bulbs. This algorithm is not possible with If This Then That either, since IFTTT allows for a \"Date & Time\" setting OR a \"Location\" setting but not both. I think this is a very obvious consumer desire that Philips should consider in their next Hue app update.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with this purchase and think home automation in general has great potential. I did NOT receive a discount or any other kind of marketing persuasion to write this review."}

I don't need crazy colorful lights...I just like regular white light...and this fits the bill. Now, you may ask, why am I'm loving it?

I can say, Alexa, Dim livingroom light 30%...and boom...it's done. You can program the lights to come on or off any day of the week or every day, at what ever time you want.\n\nThe two best features I like are the gradual brightness and the gradual darkness. So, during the winter months when I wake up before the sun rises...I used to have hit the snooze on my alarm clock once if not twice....and even I wasn't really awake even after the second snooze...just plain groggy. Well, snooze no more for me. Yes, since I've set this up, I have not hit the snooze button once. When the alarm goes off, I'm awake without issues ready to go. How you ask? Simple, I have it set up at the time my alarm clock goes off...but the Hue system would gradually brighten 10 minutes before my alarm actually goes off. This tells your body it's day time and time to wake up.\n\nAt night, I have a particular time I go to sleep...so 30 minutes before it's time for bed, the Hue system will gradually dim to till its completely off.\n\nYou can control this system by turning the light on or off even while you're away from your home."}

My only concern is lack of 2 Factor Authentication on Hue's website that allows 3rd party sites, such as IFTTT, to connect to your Hue account. While it's very secure in adding applications that directly interact with bridge, Phillips falls short in protecting users who decide to use 3rd party services, not to be confused with 3rd party apps that are physically authenticated via the button on the bridge. As such, think twice about creating an account with Hue until they implement 2FA when accessing your account via 3rd party service. This security hole keeps me from rating it 5 stars."}

Yes they take a bit of time to set up and get them established in the house (you need a hub or bridge that supports them which this comes with), but once they're set up you can control them with Alexa or your smartphone. I set mine up to turn on automatically right before I get home and dim as the night progresses until they turn off when I normally go to bed. The possibilities are endless with all of the compatible apps. My father just equipped his entire home with these bulbs and can't stop showing people his \"cool\" new lights!\n\nIf you're thinking about wanting a \"smart\" home, son't wait any longer, get these bulbs!"}

I set this up, and in exchange, she turns my lights on when I ask. These bulbs are set-up in two lamps. The lamps do not have dimmer switches. Yet when I ask Alexa to turn on the lamps, they can be dimmed. She can operate the lights separately or independently. They are in two lamps in the same room. I gave each lamp a name and noted that they are both in the same room. I can tell her to turn the lights on, and she does. I can tell her to turn on just the floor lamp and she will. I can tell her to turn both lights on 100% then tell her to turn the floor lamp down to 50% and she will. I can decrease and increase strength by 10%.\n\nThe lights can also be programmed independently of Alexa. I actually have them set so that they slowly turn themselves on 30 minutes before my alarm goes off. I LOVE THAT FEATURE.It makes waking up far easier. I also have them set so that they automatically start dimming about 30 minutes before I should be going to bed. It's a nice gentle reminder to go to sleep (as opposed to setting a bedtime alarm which is jarring and also wakes me up instead of putting me to sleep."}

I originally had an Amazon Echo Dot on my bedside table, which worked perfectly with it, but I then switched it out with my Amazon Echo. This one works with it just as well, plus it has an awesome speaker. I set up scenes in the Hue app, which is clunkly at best, but once they were set up, Alexa works great with it. I can set a scene, or simply tell her to lower the lights to 25%. It very rarely doesn't respond the first time I ask it to do something, but always responds once I ask again. I assume in these cases it's something to do with the wifi going down briefly, the hub updating, or some such anomaly. Therefore, it's very reliable, and I just wish they weren't so expensive, so I could use them in every room in my house! (These white ones are much cheaper than the colored ones, but they're still more expensive than the regular Philips LED lights. For example, I recently bought 16 of the regular Philips LED lights for $40 on Amazon, and a 3-pack of these white bulbs (without the hub) runs between $50-70 on Amazon, as well.)"}

{"Author": "Brad D.", "Date": "on February 23, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Good Product", "Text": "If I could, I would probably give these bulbs 4.5 stars, instead I'll give the benefit of the doubt. This starter kit was my first move into a \"smart\" home after buying Alexa, and I would recommend this set for both novices like me as well as more experienced smart home users. I will write my review for those making their first move into it though.\n\nThe kit as a whole seems to work pretty well. The set up was easy, just download an app, plug the bridge connector into an ethernet port, and pop a light bulb into any light and it works. That is the best thing about these bulbs imo, that you can use them on any source of light to get it to work. The app makes it simple to turn on and dim the lights, as well as assign groups so multiple lights can be used at once. Connecting to Alexa was pretty simple as well, so I am able to tell her to turn on the lights which I think is pretty cool.\n\nThe only reason I say 4.5 instead of 5 is that my bulbs don't always connect to the bridge, meaning I can't always control them with my phone. Normally I would say this would be a major functional problem, but I have a couple of factors that come into play. I live in an older house, so I do not have ethernet ports all over. The only one I have is located on my modem, which is in the front of my house while the room with my bulbs is in the back, so right away there's a pretty big distance in between them. On top of this, there is various plaster walls with concrete and metal, along with metal appliances like the fridge and oven directly in between the two, all which can disrupt the signal. My Alexa and roku still connect in the room, but the bulbs have been very spotty so far. I wouldn't expect smart bulbs to have as strong of connection to a network as either of those products, but it has come into play for me. If you think you are in a similar situation, you may want to consider the adaptability of your home. In short, I'm having connectivity issues, but I believe it is because of a variety of factors and would not prohibit me from buying this product.\n\nIt is pretty clear in the description, but this is a starter kit because you need the bridge connector for the bulbs. Once you purchase one of these, you will not need to buy another starter kit and instead will just need to buy additional bulbs at a reduced rate. While $60 seems like a lot to pay for 2 light bulbs, you're pretty much paying for the novelty of a smart home. I've been told that bulbs like these last over 20 years, so it's not like they'll burn out quickly. I compared this brand to another, and it seems like Philips really knows what they're doing, so I'd be comfortable buying from them.\n\nAll in all, I would buy this product again even with the issue I'm having. I will likely buy additional bulbs (and put them in different rooms) if that says anything."}

It does work, however I had to remove stars for this reason. The Philip's hue app that is meant to utilize these bulbs with is atrocious! After an extended period of time trying to get it to work manually, I kept getting error messages. It looked like it should've worked so I took a shot in the dark and commanded Siri to turn on living room lamp, and while she claimed she couldn't do that, she actually did. And my ligh went on. I was happy it was working but still confused. Commanded off, same thing. Commanded to turn on at 50% and sane. All worked Altho Siri claimed otherwise. Later on I tried commanding her again but for the life of me it just wasn't working. Tried again manually and still nothing. Very frustrating.\n\nThen I tried with my echo, and while the Alexa app was lagging and dragging and taking forever to find my hue, it eventually did and that was the end of that. It's worked perfectly since through commanding Alexa.\n\nI feel bad for anyone who purchased this without Alexa because they just paid a ton for regular lightbulbs and a paper weight. I would be furious. Especially since more people own iPhones rather than echo's, there's bound to be quite a few \"less than ecstatic\" customers.\n\nI also feel it's quite unnecessarily expensive, but once you get the starter kit out the way, adding extra bulbs isn't too hard on the wallet, but for the price, it should absolutely work seamlessly since it's not intended specifically for the echo. Otherwise I do like it and it's very convenient to have. I will be buying more bulbs but I strongly suggest immediate fixes to the hue app!"}

For what it is, I would give it 4 stars, but for what I expected, this deserves 2\u2014therefore I am giving it a 3.\n\nLet me start with what I expected\u2014a light system that can be voice controlled through my Alexa, with color (warmth, white to yellow) options, that is dimmable. My living room has two ceiling lights, each requiring 2 bulbs. I purchased this starter kit plus two additional bulbs for $109 at my local Best Buy (same prices as here). Seeing as I only like the whiter (I typically buy GE Reveal bulbs) color, and therefore expected to use only that color in the spectrum, I thought that $109 was a fair price for a dimmable light in that temperature. These lights are NOT adjustable, in terms of warmth. The \"soft white\" color advertised is more like an intense yellow. My entire living room lit up in yellow tones. I searched through all settings to see if I could change it to a whiter color, and learned that I needed the Philips Hue White Ambiance set instead. After looking up prices I learned that for a similar set (hub plus 4 lights, or starter kit plus 2 lights) it would cost me $175-180. If $109 was a fair an acceptable price, $175-180 is exorbitant in my opinion, especially considering that I would only use one warmth setting. This is why I am returning them. When they have a white color option for the same price I will buy them then.\n\nFor what it is, here are the pros and cons of the lights and device:\n\nPros:\n- Easy to use once set up\u2014Alexa integrates easily;\n- Discrete\u2014as long as you have white furniture, or a way to hide the hub behind a picture frame, it is easily out of the way;\n- Dimmer works well\u2014good response time and all my lights dimmed equally if I gave the command (I heard other brands have issue with this). Each light and each bulb can be dimmed by a different amount if you give the command (you just need to create groups);\n- Works well with Siri commands on my phone.\n\nCons:\n- The setup is a bit confusing. The instructions start with \"turn all lights on,\" they don't mention that bulbs should be in lights that are turned on. Step 2 is to plug and pair the hub, step 3 is to download the app and continue setup there. Upon reading these, I wasn't certain that the bulbs wouldn't require close proximity to the hub for initial pairing of lights to hub in the app portion of the instructions, so I ignored step 1 and went to 2 and 3 instead. Considering my lights are on the ceiling and require a ladder to install (high ceilings), I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't need to complicate the installation process down the line. I'm all for 1,2,3 setup instructions, but these weren't worded well.\n- Had a few connectivity glitches at first when pairing with Siri. Had to restart the apps a couple of times to connect.\n- Not having choice of color warmth. I'd be happy to have only one color warmth (white or yellow) provided by this bulb, but I'd like to be able to choose which color. These bulbs provide shockingly yellow light, and this isn't improved when they are dimmed.\n- The fact that a hub is needed for these bulbs is a bit frustrating, an extra device in the house. I will look forward to future models that won't require a hub.\n\nOverall, an item that simplifies life\u2014if you also have the Alexa\u2014voice commands make this item really great."}

My husband said the price per additional bulb was ridiculous, but after just one day of us being able to switch off just two of the lights from bed, he asked if I would add to our collection. The dimming feature is great for weary morning eyes or for mood lighting (wink wink). It is great that only one hub needs to be purchased for a home (unless you have more than 50 light bulbs, I think). It was extremely easy to set up and works flawlessly with Echo Dot, which is just fun! In fact, my daughter's first sentence may be, \"Alexa, office light on 20%.\" I definitely highly recommend this little system... Life is hard enough; let these magical lightbulbs let you take it easy once in a while : )"}

I have 4 lights in my room and created one group for them called 'the lights'. When I attempt to turn on or off the lights, more times than not I find at least one of the bulbs doesn't respond and I often have to repeat the command or manually turn off the light, defeating the purpose of this product. The same goes for if I wish to dim the lights, a lot of the time only a certain amount of lights will dim.\n\nThe other downside is the response time can vary from being instant, to taking 10+ seconds, which can be annoying when you're entering a dark room. I find that calling on individual lights will generally get a faster response than calling on groups of lights, as the system will only turn on the lights after 'giving up' on searching for an unresponsive light.\n\nThere are many occasions where you give Alexa a command regarding the lights which she acknowledges with an 'OK', but still the command isn't carried through."}

However, if you plan on integrating the system with Apple's Homekit or Amazon's Alexa there will be frustrations. If you plan on only using the Phillips Hue app, you will be less frustrated, but seeing as they advertise compatibility with Alexa and Homekit, it is relevant that Hue does not always work with them. Most of the time, there are at least 2 of the 4 bulbs I have that are showing unresponsive. I can rule out an issue with Alexa and Homekit because they both experience the issues, leaving only the Hue system to blame. There is some great value in the Hue system, but only at the beta level. I will endure the issues, and update the review if the problems are remedied.\n\nUPDATE - It is indeed the Hue system at fault. The 4 different bulbs cycle between \"reachable\" and \"unreachable\". I know it is not a distance issue, as one of the bulbs effected is in the same room as the bridge, only 8 feet from the bridge. Sometimes the lights will still function while in the \"unreachable\" state, but also sometimes they won't function regardless of the state. This needs to be resolved ASAP Phillips, it is unacceptable.\n\nUPDATE - So for the past 24 hours the system has been working flawlessly alone and with Alexa and HomeKit. I do not know why, the only thing I've done since my last update is pick it up to read some info on the sticker of the bridge. Maybe the 1 or 2 inches I moved it after putting it back down has effected it somehow. I will give the item a 4 until it proves to be no further issue, or until the issues resume."}

If my 8-year-old nephew attempted to set this system up, I bet he could! The Phillips Hue app that is necessary to make this system work has surprisingly limited functionality but you can download third party apps such as Hue Disco, Onswitch, Huey, etc. for more special lighting scenes and/or the ability to sync your lights with music or movies. I did encounter a problem with one light bulb coming on repeatedly after being turned off. My immediate response was to search Google to find out what other people did to fix this issue. This led me on a journey of changing the bridges IP address, removing all third party apps, rebooting the bridge and router, and failed attempts to login to my router (forgot what I changed default username/password to). After doing all of this and having the light bulb still flicker on and off randomly, I moved the problem bulb into another area of the house. Voila! Problem solved. It turns out that the cause of the problem was due to a bad outlet connection; the extension cable my lamp was plugged into was loose in the wall socket! Be sure to check the wall socket first to see if the connection is loose if you are experiencing a similar issue."}

{"Author": "Nick Ferri", "Date": "on January 25, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Excellent Smart Home light system", "Text": "I purchased this along with a three light color starter kit. The kit arrived on time in a no-hassle box, which was of a solid construction cardboard supporting the bulbs with a compartment for the Bridge and instruction booklet.\nInstalling the light bulbs was a learning curve. After downloading the Hue app, I plugged the bulbs in and turned them on expecting the app to auto-populate with the lights. They did not initially connect. I had to unscrew the bulbs and input the bulb serial numbers into the app before they would connect to the Bridge. Once connected, the app was easy to navigate, change the light names, add rooms, etc.\nI have had the light kit for about two months and have since connected them to my Echo Dot. The voice commands work well for the white lights, but to an extent. Even though the lights are white in color, you can change them to have a blue or yellow tint to mimic the outside world. You can change the dim percentage, turn them on or off, and blink them with the IFTT app, but you can not set a scene with a voice command. That could be an Echo issue, or it could be a combination of the Echo and the Hue.\n\nI would definitely recommend it for a smart home purchase.\n\nPro: Solid, heavy lights fit the majority of household sockets.\nFun and easy to use once installed.\nEcho integration is very easy.\n\nCon: The Bridge comes with a short (roughly 2ft) Ethernet cord and must be plugged into a router or the wall for operation.\nI wish the Echo voice commands could work to set the scenes as well as basic operations.\nAll the lights dropped their connection to the Bridge once since installation. A Bridge reset was required to reconnect everything."}

I loved using my Echo Dot to control the lights in my office. I have a few issues with them though. First, somehow the \"sync\" between the Hue bridge and Alexa was lost, so I guess I'm going to have to reconfigure Alexa to use them again. Second, the Hue app leaves a LOT to be desired. If there's an update for your device (bridge, bulb, anything), you can't use the app until updating everything. so going to turn your lights off and go to bed, you have to sit and wait 5 minutes while the update finishes. Another quirk is the widget. I tried putting the widget on my home screen after the Alexa sync was lost and that was an even worse experience. Sometimes it appears to be sending the control, but nothing actually happens. Other times, the widget shows the opposite state of the bulbs (shows on when off and off when on). Maybe the next generation is better, but with the same app, I won't bother upgrading until I've seen a much improved workflow."}

The bulbs are sufficiently bright at 100%. Works seamlessly with both my Google Home and Amazon Echo. I love being able to dim the lights with my voice. I also have timers set so that the lights come on at a low level just as I'm waking up and switch off as I'm leaving the house for work. I'd recommend to anyone with home wifi looking for basic smart home lighting, particularly if you have one of the aforementioned voice assistants. The phone app also works just fine for controlling the lights. I have noticed a couple of times there is a slight delay between opening the app and actually being able to control the lights.

Purchased this for my parents and they are having a blast controlling the hue bulbs using Alexa on an echo and dot. Installation is quite simple but it does require an ethernet cable (not WiFi) and should be placed in a central location. If the hub cannot connect to a remote bulb buy an additional bulb $14, as each bulb is a repeater for the Zigbee Light Link network used by Hue. I have used the v1 hub with the GE smart bulbs, but I am pretty sure Hue will not work with the osram bulbs, if you are looking for alternate bulbs. To connect your Hue to Alexa you need to add the Hue Skill and connect the hub to the my.meethue.com web site and configure each of your bulbs and rooms. To add some more features connect the Hue to IFTTT.com and you can turn on/off lights when arriving home or leaving, turn on lights when the sun sets through simple recipe's. IFTTT (if this then that) is a great service with hundreds of connected services you can control your lights and other home automation systems using."}

You can use them with Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Logitech Harmony, Smartthings, or even with Google Wifi/OnHub (in any browser, you can permit even guests to type in on.here and control certain smart devices). I own all of the above except Smartthings, and it works seamlessly.\n\nIt also has IFTTT integration, which makes it basically compatible with anything. If you have a IFTTT-connected router, you can make it so every time your phone comes back on wifi (aka you arrive home), certain lights come on. If your Fitbit senses you're awake, turn lights on.\n\nI like the smart bulbs better than smart outlet plugs for lighting, as these can dim and turn on a little slower. They also work better/with more things than TP Link or WeMo.\n\nSome people like the color changing ones - but really it seems like a gimmick. The lights aren't as bright when in color, and when are you really going to make your lights green?\n\nI will say, sometimes the app can very infrequently be unreliable, but this is my top pick for smart lighting."}

Now that I have the bridge (which was very easy to setup by following the instructions on the Hue app), I'd like to expand the use of them in my house. Asking Alexa to turn off lights in a particular room is incredibly convenient and very easy to set up. Furthermore, you can dim these lights to specific percentages, allowing you to illuminate the room as much as you find necessary. Because of the ease of use with Alexa, I have not utilized the Hue Routines to their full potential, but their are lots of options available within the app. You can program the lights to dim as you fall asleep, brighten as you wake up, or turn on and off at certain times when you are away from home.

The dimming capability alone was enough to make me jump for joy - no more dinners in a room lit like a fast food restaurant, and I don't have to replace my too-bright reading lamp for a dimming version.

I ended up throwing away the Link hub from this kit and purchasing a Wink hub, which immediately resolved my issues. The support person informed me that the manufacturer of this hub went out of business and has been replaced with a different company who does not support this product. With the Wink Hub 2 Wink Hub 2 now released, the original Wink Hub Wink Connected Home Hub is very affordable. I would highly recommend purchasing that hub with the light bulbs separately.

{"Author": "bookworm", "Date": "on December 27, 2016", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Try, Try Again", "Text": "I saw some of the other reviews after I made my purchase and was immediately wishing I had made a different selection. But I decided to see this through. Still, I was more than a little skeptical as I opened my starter kit and went through the set-up process with my brand new Echo and a companion Dot. So if you just want the short version, I will say that while the set-up wasn't a walk in the park, it wasn't climbing Mount Everest either. If you want the \"gory details,\" perhaps hoping to discover a few helpful hints, here's the longer version of what took place after I installed one of the Philip's bulbs in my bedroom and the other one in the living room:\nAfter 5 or 6 failed attempts for Echo (sitting in my living room) to recognize my Hue Bridge (about 15 feet away in the next room), I moved the Bridge about 8 inches, moving it from sitting on top of my router at the back of the desk to the middle of the desk. As I tried Echo's \"discover devices\" process yet again, instead of pressing the big button on the Bridge just once I decided to press it several times, even decided to hold it down for about 10 seconds. One of these random, meaningless acts apparently made all the difference and this time Alexa proudly announced that she had discovered my Hue Lights! In fact, she discovered twelve, although I only have two!! I have no idea where the other 10 came from, except to say that they appear to be \"bright\" or \"dimmed\" versions of the two I had installed. Getting Alexa to actually turn them on and off was another whole learning process, however. To spare you the hour or two of frustration, suffice it to say that I successfully named the lights in My Hue account, which made little difference to Alexa. She repeatedly told me she couldn't find anything under those names. Eventually I also learned that I didn't need to say, \"Alexa, open Hue\"--to which she consistently replied that she was having trouble with skills and recommended that I try again later. Apparently, I only needed to say, \"Alexa, turn on ____ lights\" or \"Alexa, turn off ___ lights.\" This nugget of information was cleverly included as an example of Alexa's abilities, clearly hidden in plain sight in the helpful paperwork that came with Alexa. I only needed to take heed of it. However, the real key was the divine revelation that it was also necessary to create groups for my lights in the Alexa app on my phone. Apparently this applies even if I only wanted one light in the \"group.\" So I created a group for the Bedroom and a second group for the Living Room, voiced the request, \"Alexa, turn on living room lights,\" and presto, SUCCESS!! But when I tried this in the bedroom, no such success.I must admit it was a little puzzling why Alexa politely declined to turn on the bedroom light when using the Dot we had set up for my wife in the bedroom, but I knew now that there must be a way. If she could do it in the living room, I felt certain she could master the same task in the bedroom. Another divine inspiration led me to create the same groups in the Alexa app on my wife's phone, and then at long last, COMPLETE SUCCESS!! Issue the instruction to either Echo or Dot and the lights go on or off as requested. After I rest up a bit, I might even try to add several more bulbs in some other rooms of the house."}

Semi-incompatible with third party hardware. Hue uses ZigBee, which in theory makes it compatible with non-Hue stuff. However, this doesn't work so well. If you use anything other than Hue products (which are generally more expensive), you will find those products often go offline or become non-responsive. Other Zigbee-based hubs (Smarthings, for example) have no problem with third party stuff. Either Phillips is trying force you to buy their stuff (evil), or they aren't as good as other manufacturers (incompetent).\n\n2. App sucks. Every time the app updates it wants me to go upstairs an push the button on my hub. Why? Why can't the damn thing just update? And the app seems to be getting worse with each update. In the latest version it will no longer allow me to rename lights. I'm stuck with \"Dimmable Bulb #1\" - which makes it almost impossible to use with Alexa or Google Home.\n\n3. Expensive. As previously stated, Phillips stuff is the most expensive. I thought I'd be getting what I paid for - I was wrong.\n\nAvoid Phillips Hue."}

{"Author": "Ranger Phil", "Date": "on December 26, 2016", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Convenient, good quality lights", "Text": "These are bitchin! We have a house built in the 1940s that as we make improvements for energy efficiency I'm also trying to introduce some automation. We've converted to almost all LED lighting, super insulated the attic, installed a modern HVAC system, a solar PV system and so on, so this is a minor but fun and useful improvement.\nThe problem for us though is that we don't have that many fixtures that just use a standard socket anymore. I sure hope that Philips makes some hue bulbs that will work in track light (GU 10) fittings and with the small screw in sockets used in some chandeliers, as well as bulbs used in today's ceiling fans. Then we could have some exquisite light control throughout the house.\nI'm not sure how I paired the included hub with my Alexa devices (tap and dot) but it worked after a few minutes. I've got my lights on a sunset-late evening and an early morning schedule, but it's pretty danged convenient to just ask Alexa to light the living room during storms when there's poor natural light. I can also control the lights from the Hue app on my iphone.\n\nGiven the cost, I'm not sure if these will ever pan out as a true money saver for us, but the increase efficiency is worth a small extra cost, and LEDs are a darn sight better than the CFLs that I've replaced."}

Great when you are ready for bed and the lamp is a bit of a reach, or you have a couple of lights out of reach. (Also if your significant other is already asleep).\nWith the application you can check to see of the lights are out or on as you wish from anywhere you can use the application on your phone."}
{"Author": "Alundy", "Date": "on December 26, 2016", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Only one light works will update after replacement received.", "Text": "First let's be clear you must hard wire to your router to the hub so you must have a router close enough to your light location that it will eventually control.\n\nAlso it seems that the hub must be on the same network as your echo. Probably this is intuitive but was not for me. The easiest hub to use was a network that my echo was not using because it is a slower network. I had to change networks. The faster network is in the basement and could cause connection issues.\n\nOnce the echo dot found the lights it named them, hopefully I can change the name somehow later to something easier and shorter\nProblem is one of the lights will turn off but not on. I swapped it into different lamps and no matter where it goes it will turn off via voice but not on. Once I tell it to turn on, and it stays out I can turn the on off switch on the lamp to off and back on and it will light back up. But once I turn it off via voice it will not come back on. The other light works perfectly.\nSo based on other reviews which document pretty clearly the lack of hue support from Phillips when there is a problem I will be returning to Amazon for replacement.\n\nOn a second note perhaps if Phillips gets enough of these back they will see it is more beneficial to handle customer issues more efficuently. It is a great idea and I don't care so much one was bad. Anyone can have a bad product now and then. What matters to me is how they are handled. It's why I like Amazon so much.\n\nWill update when I get the replacement. Btw I did not download the app on my iPhone and use it. I got these just for use with my dot. I will try that before I return to see if the App works in case someone want them just to use with their phone. But if it won't work with Alexa it is no good for me."}

This kit will work directly with alexa (amazon echo) without the need of another smart hubs like smartthings or similar, but if your going to expand your smart devices throughout your house your going to need a smart hub anyway. The smart hubs require hard wire to routers also so with this setup that takes up two ports on a router alone. not to mention three power cords (router, hub, gateway) requiring power at in the same area.

One of these deals was for the Phillips Hue starter kit and bridge, and how could I resist? It seems once you get an Alexa product, a whole new world of home automation opens up. The bridge is easy to install, it must be attached to your wifi router to work, and the bulbs are dimmable and recognizable immediately in the Alexa app. There have been a few times in the last month since I purchased them where Alexa told me that the light wasn't able to connect at the moment, and I have no idea why, but after a few minutes pass, eventually they do come on or off. That's why I'm taking off a star, that and the price as compared to other manufacturers of bulbs, and outlets, like TP Link.\nI have found that while I like these, I prefer to have the lamps automated by TP Link outlets, and I prefer using their app to set up recipes for when I want them on and off or the IFFT app is good for that, too. I've never had a problem of the TP Link outlets not connecting or turning my lamps on or off like the Phillips hue seems to have.\nI would have never paid the full price to get the Hue Starter kit, but it's okay when discounted. I highly recommend the TP link outlets over these. And download the IFFT app to create your own recipes. I like the TP link app Kasa, as well.\nI hope they figure out how to make these bulbs or the bridge act more consistently."}

{"Author": "Hammer", "Date": "on December 17, 2016", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "This is a good, not great product", "Text": "I been using Philips Hue lights for several months now. I have a few of the \u201cstandard\u201d LEDs that replace 60W incandescent bulbs, and several BR32 programmable white LEDs that go into ceiling cans. My conclusion is that Hue falls short in some critical areas and that most people will be just as happy with good soft-white LEDs that work with old-school light switches. Here\u2019s why:\n\nThe LEDs themselves: The Hue LEDs make fine light \u2013brighter than the incandescent bulbs they replace, in warm tones and using far less energy. That\u2019s great, but that is no different than any number of LEDs you can buy for far less money. You are paying a big premium for the connected features, and that is where things fall off fast with Hue. They also don\u2019t seem to have the ability to maintain a setting. So if you like a certain \u201cscene\u201d (color and brightness in Hue-speak) for your lights, it would be nice if you could set to that scene and have that scene active when you turn on the lights using your old fashioned wall switches. That doesn\u2019t work with Hue and you can\u2019t change the default. They will always turn on to the factory default with your wall switch, and if you\u2019re like most people, you probably don\u2019t want to have to reach for your iPhone every time you want to turn on a light. Philips solution for this is that you replace your wall switches with their proprietary switches at $30 a copy.\n\nThe Hue Bridge: The Hue Bridge is the central controller for the lights. It uses Zigbee (radio) to connect to the lights. Philips made a few big mistakes with this. First, they did not make the Hub a WiFi client. Had they done that, you\u2019d be able to put the bridge anywhere there was power to get maximum coverage to reach all the lights in your home (which is critical). But instead you have to have a wired connection, which for many people means direct connection to your home router which may not be in an optimal location in your home for coverage, or using a wired jack which you may not have available. That matters because if the bridge can\u2019t reach an LED to turn it on at a scheduled time, that LED just doesn\u2019t turn on (or off) because the signaling mechanism they use does not confirm that the action actually had an effect. The Hue Bridge simply sends the signal once at the appointed time and if the LED is out of reach because of interference (ZigBee uses 2.4GHz band where there is tons of interference), weak signal etc. too bad \u2013that light won\u2019t change. If your lights are distributed between floors, or you have some in outside fixtures, you\u2019re bound to run into this. Philips suggests you buy another bridge to solve this (which is a running theme for them).\n\nThe App: The app delivers decent functionality for the basics like tuning lights on and off, dimming, changing colors, etc. But there are certain things that are really weak. Foremost among the Cons is scheduling your lights which Hue calls \u201cRoutines\u201d. The interface for this is crazy-making. First off, you can\u2019t just create a simple schedule like in one place to turn your outside lights on and off for example. You create one routine to turn the lights ON, and a second routine to turn the lights OFF. Why? How about I just select the days of the week and say turn on at 6:00PM and off at 6:00AM? Why make me do it twice? I have four sets of lights that I want on a schedule. That means eight routines. The routines interface also requires too many clicks and is not intuitive \u2013it\u2019s grey and white on black and if you select a day of the week you turn it grey (from black) and grey typically means not active these days so you\u2019ll wonder if you did it right (Philips should be ripping off the Nest app interface). Then there are the obvious missing features like scheduling based on sunrise/sunset. It would be easy to just enter your zip code into your bridge and have it determine when to turn lights on or off based on when the sun was rising or setting in your area. But Philips wants does not offer that. They do offer a light/motion sensor you can buy to tell when the sun goes up or down (just like they had in the 1970s).\n\nFinally, your Hue LEDs won\u2019t like conventional dimmers. Philips wants to sell you their proprietary dimmers.\n\nMy conclusion is the system is not worth it for normal lighting applications. I\u2019ll continue using it to schedule outdoor lights and a few lights when I\u2019m away, but that\u2019s it. I\u2019m buying inexpensive LEDs for everything else with no regret."}

I did some research and decided to go with Philips Hue. I really wish I had gone with them from the start.\n\nSetup was insanely easy. The hue lamps work as 'mini-bridges' so running lights across the home was a snap. I like how you can organize lights by rooms and control the lighting scheme as rooms or individual lights. My bride loves our variable white lamp - I installed that one in our living room near her recliner....it will be perfect for relaxing or reading. The bridge will accommodate some 50 lights and accessories - this should be fine for most homes.\n\nI haven't worked much with routines yet - I tend to get up insanely early, but I will run up something that will work well for my Bride.\n\nThe price of bulbs aren't outrageous when you consider the cost of a 'dumb' LED light bulb. Other accessories - like the dimmer switch - convinced me that this was a good way to go; the ability to use a conventional style switch when your phone isn't handy is a great idea. I do wish Philips had smart outlets - I would love to be able to control my Christmas tree. I understand that this could work with a third party outlet - I will probably play around with this over Christmas break (I am a teacher).\n\nIntegration? I haven't decided if I am going with Alexa or Google Home (sorry Jeff)...but Philips works well with either voice activated platform so I am sure that it will be fine either way.\n\nAll in all, a simple and powerful kit to get your smart home lighting solution well in hand."}

You need to have the bridge close to your router or modem because it needs a cable connection, apparently it doesn't have a dual band connection with Wifi. that's a big set back if you have a big house and your brigde cannot cover all the rooms. Not sure if it works with location, for example: when i am arriving home turn on the lights, when i am leaving home turn off the light, but it doesn't say it work in the manual. easy to install in you smartphone and to set the widgets if you have android."}

I have never once opened the Hue app and had a connection already established to the Hue bridge, so a wait for it to connect is always mandatory, but in fact the vast majority of the time the connection attempt fails and I have to close the app and reopen it - repeat as necessary for the thing to finally work -- EVERY TIME you want to use the light/s in question. Why can't a background enabled app just stay connected?? I thought the ability to dim any light in your house was a lovely concept, but it is not an on demand deal. It happens after five minutes of fiddling with the Hue app or bridge, if it works at all, and I for one don't have time for it. They are getting uninstalled."}

{"Author": "John Thompson", "Date": "on December 7, 2016", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Not as implied", "Text": "This an update to my previous review below. Phillips sent me a link to get a java app that works on IBM and Mac computers and to find the bulbs. Note the app requires that the bulbs be turned on and with in 30cm of the bridge so you will probably need a small portable light fixture and possibly an extension cord. It works and you have to go through meethue and rename the devices. [...] It would be nice if Phillips would include this and other information in printed form with the bulbs instead relying totally on their app. Also I have not been able to use Alexa to access the Color temperature on my Ambiance bulbs.\n\nThe started kit will work with Alexa, the meethue web site by Philips, and the All 4 HUE app in the amazon app store. However the setup is not that nice no written instructions other than to go to the meethue website and download the Philips hue app for your phone. The Philips hue in the amazon app store does not work on a fire phone (not compatible with fire Os). I recommend that you check the web site and the phone app before ordering. Most of this information has been extracted from a conversation with Phillips support over the phone\n\nAnother important thing the bridge must be hardwired to an ethernet port on your router it will not wifi connect to the router. Also The Bridge and the bulbs come pre linked. The Phone app is the only way to link extra bulbs to the bridge. the web site will not link extra bulbs but it will allow you to rename the bulbs and setup groups and even turn them on and off the names can be used with Alexa. Once the bridge is connected the ring light and the 3 other indicator lights should be on.\n\nLinking to Alexa is relatively easy, ask Alexa to discover devices and push the button on the bridge. But all extra bulbs must be discovered by the phone app and listed on the website for Alexa to use them. at the moment there is no way to use these and expand the system with out the phone apps. I ordered 3 extra ambiance lights and I have not been able to connect to the bridge."}

{"Author": "SMB", "Date": "on December 5, 2016", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Lights 5-Stars; App 3-Stars", "Text": "There are really two use cases for these lights. The first is that you want to use the colored lights to pair your lighting with your mood. I don't really feel the need to do that. The second is to automate lights to save energy; to make the home look lived in; or to dim otherwise non-dimmable lights (e.g. lamps). I have a lot of use for that.\n\nI have installed the Hue app and I mostly control the lights through the apple integration on the iPhone. Initially, I had a hard time with the lights. They wouldn't reliably go on according to schedule. I couldn't always access them. A week ago my router died. I replaced it and all is well now. So apparently that was my router not Hue. So the lights work as advertised.\n\nThe app is clearly oriented around \"scenes\". That's the first use case, the one for which I have no use. For automation the app pretty much sucks. You can set the lights to go on/off/dim at a given time. If, you want that time to be sunset or dawn, you'll have to adjust that yourself. It might not be a big deal for some people, but it was kind of the point for me. Fortunately, I have Apple TV and an iPhone. I can set a sunset schedule using the phone and the AppleTV will execute it even when I'm away. That's fine, but I think the Hue app should handle that on it's own."}

I know - walking to a light switch isn't that hard, but with this, you can create all kinds of options and then in conjunction with Alexa, just use your voice. You can also use some geofencing features to turn lights on and off automatically, or set vacation programs. The nice part is that you are no longer tied to how your house is wired. Want the lamp plugged into the wall and the fixture in the ceiling to go on together? Well you can set that up. Want the kitchen and garage light to go on at the same time? Well you can do that too.\n\nNow I'm just saving the pennies to keep buying more components for the system so that I can get more automated. Because let's be real here - these are not cheap. I never thought I'd say this, but it is worth it."}

I think it is one of the best devices I have brought into my home. Since that purchase, I have bought 3 additional Amazon Dots to scatter around the house.\n\nThe next step was automating my lighting. I had several options before me. One option was to use my existing light bulbs and buy a TP LINK smart plug. I thought very hard about that choice and decided not to do it. I didn't want some large plug outlet device in my home. Additionally, many Amazon reviewers had stated the installation instructions were confusing and they ended up having connection issues. Finally, and most importantly, I wanted my bulbs to have the ability to \"dim\" on command.\n\nI must say, I am not very happy with Philips pricing. They pretty much dominate the home automated lighting market, and as such, they charge a huge premium for their product. Two years ago I bought their hue lighting strips and I paid a small fortune for them. Fortunately, their products are highly reliable, but be prepared that once you enter this market with this brand, it's not going to come cheap.\n\nThis starter kit is pretty darn expensive. You could do cheaper with a TP LINK outlet, but once you buy this starter kit, all you need to do in order to expand your home lighting, is to just add more bulbs. The hub/bridge is capable of running up to 50 lights.\n\nThis is the version 2.0 hub, by the way, which improves upon the original hub by adding support for Siri home kit.\n\nThe hub is very easy to set up. First, it's important to know that you need to plug this into a router. It cannot be used wirelessly. The hub comes with a short ethernet plug to enable the connection. Simply plug it into an available ethernet connection on your router.\n\nNext, download the Philips Hue app on either your iOS or Android device. The app detects the new hub/bridge in your home and guides you through the process of adding new bulbs. Essentially, the hub automatically recognizes any new bulbs it finds in your home.\n\nTo use with Amazon Echo, you will need the Echo app, which owners should already have. An additional step is required where you need to go into the Alexa App, select SETTINGS, and have it automatically detect new devices. It will find the Philips bulbs automatically. Next step is to create a new GROUP in the Alexa App. Add the bulbs and give the GROUP a name.\n\nFrom therein, you simply tell Alexa, \"Turn on <Group Name>,\" \"Turn off <Group Name>,\" \"Dim <Group Name>,\" and you will be delighted by the results.\n\nNow the downside: These bulbs are only capable of illuminating up to 60 Watts. Of course, Philips offers different sized lighting, including color changing bulbs. I *believe* the larger bulbs provide higher wattage.\n\nThese are LED lights that are included, so they will run longer than average bulbs. That will certainly make up for the added expense.\n\nWhat I really like about this starter kit is that it provides an entry point for my entire home automation. From here I can add more Philips lights, including their bloom, strip and other accent lighting. As I mentioned earlier, I am already using their Hue strips to accent areas of my home.\n\nDespite other reviews I have just read here on Amazon, I can tell you without a doubt that setting this system up is very simple. There are absolutely no connection issues. The Philips app does a great job of walking you through the setup process. You can have this bridge and lighting up and working, out of box, in about 15 minutes.\n\nTo be able to walk from room to room giving commands to turn on various lamps in the home, is a rewarding experience. In fact, one thing I forgot to mention is that the lighting can be controlled remotely through the Philips app. So, before you even walk through your front door, you can have the lights illuminated, awaiting your arrival. Forgot to turn lights off? No problem, you can do it remotely.\n\nHighly recommend this product for anyone wanting to take their home lighting into the 21st century."}

I think the problem is primarily in the software and/or customer support. Virtually no instructions come with the package, it basically says plug it into the network. When you look at the related apps, there are 3 or 4 of them depending where you look. I primary use a Fire tablet at home so I went there first. There are 2 apps available. The first is is just called Hue and it appears to be from Phillips. It didn't work at all for me. It would get to the bridge paring step and just sit there. I then downloaded the other App called \"All 4 Hue\". It seemed to find the bridge OK, but then couldn't find the lights. I was about to give up, but I figured I would see if Alexa could see them. Lo and behold she could, and I could control them. However, there appeared to be no way to change the name of the lights from the default \"Hue ultra light ...\". I quit in frustration. The next day, I tried downloading and installing the Hue app on my iPhone. It seemed to work much better than the Fire version - the bridge paring worked anyway, but still no way to changes the name. I decided to go back through the sequence, and noticed I had failed to create an account on the Phillips Hue web site (I generally skip this step , not being a fan of never-ending spam.) I went ahead and set up an account, and discovered that all my devices we're visible on the website, and there is a way to change the names! I did so, and once I \"forgot\" and \"rediscovered\" the devices on Alexa all was well.\n\nSo, a few observations\" 1) You have to be willing to struggle a little to get things to work. I can't imagine why Philips can't just fix their app so that it works correctly in all its versions,. It seems to indicate that they aren't real committed to this whole Hue thing, so it may not be a good long term play, especially in the smart home space that has so many competing technologies. 2) It's a little disturbing that all your stuff ends up out on the web and you have no control over it. Smart home devices may be the next big target for hackers, since there don't seem to be any user accessible security controls provided beyond having a strong password at the site. Of course, this is true for the vast majority of the devices on the internet of things."}

The idea was to have it linked with my Amazon Echo and be voice controlled. It didn't really work out very well to be honest. I am a tech guy and was able to start getting things figured out and getting it to work with the help of some forums and youtube videos. I can imagine my mother having quite the time trying to get everything up and running.\n\nAnother annoyance for me personally was the \"warm\" color of these bulbs. Now I will take responsibility for not fully researching and figuring out which bulbs were \"warm,\" which were color, and which had the varied \"whites.\" I recently purchased both SHINE HAI LED Light Bulbs 60 Watt Equivalent, A19 LED Bulb UL-Listed, Daylight Light Bulbs 5000K, E26 Socket, Not Dimmable - Pack of 6 and Philips 455717 100W Equivalent A19 LED Daylight Light Bulb, 4-Pack absolutely LOVE them. The bright \"daylight\" whites these bulbs emit is almost life changing. By far the overall best and biggest change I have made to the house. After research I understand the hue bulbs can come in \"daylight\" versions, but this wasn't it and they are much more expensive.\n\nAlso with these the power to the lights have to be on at all time (light switch on). Where this may be a problem for some (me for example) is that in my kitchen for example I have nine light bulbs that are actuated by the light switch. Therefore if I wanted to install the hue I would have to go \"all in\" with all nine lights. It isn't a pick and choose thing.\n\nThese could work out for some I could imagine but I'll pass for now until the connectivity and price issues are improved."}

I have gone through rebooting the router, trying to manually put in the IP address, even resetting it to factory settings and nothing has worked.\nI gave it two stars because when it worked it was awesome, but now I am stuck with some very pricey light bulbs. Even replacing it for another $60 for a new bridge probably won't work according to reviews, because the software says I have to get permission from the previous person to share it with me, which is me, of course.\nI will call support and report back if they are any help.\n\nhttps://smile.amazon.com/dp/B014H2OZAC/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0"}

I wanted to love it, I really really did. Unfortunately, I think this technology needs a little more work to get the final bugs out before I can love it.\nThe bulbs periodically become \"unreachable\" which is annoying as you have to try all sorts of things to get them back to working again. Sometimes a simple reset of the hub works, sometimes you have to go through many steps to figure out why it will not work and sometimes you end up on the phone with tech support as they walk you through the same things you have already tried.\nI have owned this set for 6 months now, it is the latest generation and I have the latest firmware update and yet my bulbs STILL end up \"unreachable\" which leaves me not being able to control them with any app, and also makes them not work when they are set up as a routine. This has happened at least 5 times since I got them and it is quite frustrating. Especially since I depend on one of my bulbs to help me wake up with a gradual brightening of the room. I should have just bought a daytime simulator for the room but I wanted controllable bulbs elsewhere and it would be nice to have everything on the same system.\nThere is no rhyme or reason to the issue either: they go offline after any power outage, the distance from the hub makes no difference, sometimes I have to actually delete them from the app and add them back manually..a real pain to have to keep doing. And today that is not working at all. Which means I will be back on the phone with tech support. Again.\nWhen it works, it is great but then I face disappointment and inconvenience when it does not work. It definitely makes me hesitate to continue to add bulbs to the system. My original plan was to replace most of the bulbs in my home with these. I will NOT be doing that until they are more dependable."}

{"Author": "MacPara", "Date": "on November 15, 2016", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Nice light bulbs, buggy hub and a major design flaw", "Text": "I bought this kit for exactly one purpose. This should act as a sunrise simulation during the darker winter months to help me wake up a bit more energized in the morning.\nUsing the iPad app allowed me to do that successfully and it does help me with getting up.\nIn addition to that I use the lights as bedside lamps dimmed to 20% when going to bed and I integrated the lights with an Echo Dot for convenience, using voice commands instead of an app. All works great - when it works.\n\nRecently (1 week after the return period for my amazon Prime purchase expired), the hub has started to act up. It seems to shut itself off albeit it has no documented function to do that. I find it plugged in with all the lights off and the power supplu plug measures to provide voltage. I plug it back in and the hub starts up as expected only to be off again some 24h later. It seems to happen more frequently too. Also, I have noticed that the range of the hub seems to have reduced slightly. It used to reliably reach my bulbs in the bedroom all the time. Now I find myself repeating commands to Alexa about the lights because only one of them is responding. After about 3 tries usually all of the bulbs followed the request but this is not how it worked in the first few weeks.\nI guess I will have to deal with Philips Customer Service to get my hub repaired. That's pretty annoying given Philips' reputation and the fact that this hub just worked fine for a few weeks. Of course, the lights' main function will not be available for the time the hub is gone as the lights only turn off or fully on when using a physical switch.\n\nOh, and one more thing to consider when you buy these to use in your bedroom! I live in an area where power outages are common. You will not enjoy these bulbs during nights where the power goes down and then decides to come back up at 3am. Even worse if the power flickers and cannot decide if it wants to stay on or not, as these bulbs do NOT go back to their pre-power-loss state but always to full on.\nI learned this the hard way when we had intermittent power outages due to wind tearing off a wire on a close-by power pole. The lights briefly went to 100% and then turned off half a second later and then doing the same over and over within a few minutes. Once I determined what was going on I was of course fully awake and the next work day was a pain to go through. Not what I was looking for exactly. I do not recommend these for your bedroom because of this design flaw!"}

We have 2 echo dots, use apple home kit, have two Ecobee's (which we love), so we were ready to make the leap. After installing the bulbs and plugging in the bridge, we were completely shocked with how easy it was to be up and running. Everyone's results will vary of course, but we had the echo dots connected to the bridge, the lights registered on the hue app and connected, the lights showing up in home kit, and voice commands to Siri and Alexa changing the dimness within 10 mins! We were impressed.\n\nOne thing to note, amazon is not advertising this, but these lights must be a new release as they are 840 Lumens, a touch more powerful than the last series of bulbs. We also went to Bed Bath and Beyond and they were selling single 840 Lumen bulbs as well. Last week however, we ordered the 2 pack from Amazon of the regular A 19 bulbs that were including in this kit and they were only 800 lumens. Hopefully Amazon is just working through inventory and the new generation bulbs that BBB is selling and the ones included in this kit will be sold on Amazon as pairs.\n\nBottom line is this kit is great, astonishingly easy to set up and use (even set timers and commands) , and most important look great and don't flicker!"}

Well i was not going to remove all my channels, so I contacted Philips support and they sent me a ticket telling me that they would contact me as soon as possible. That was 6 days ago! Needless to say, I am returning this item and letting all buyers know that if this is not working with your system there seems to be no real solution or explanation. Very, disappointed in the device but maybe more so by Philips .... VERY BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT"}

So... you can't do anything like controlling a ceiling fan. Also, at ~$15 per white bulb or ~$45 per color light... replacing bulbs could get expensive. (As if the system itself isn't expensive) To control the lights you have to use a cell phone app unless you have an Amazon Echo. Then you can voice control. IMHO it will get old booting up your phone app to turn on the lights... but with Amazon Echo it's fun and easy. Now they do have light switches that you glue to the wall or use as remotes. This avoids having to use the phone app. Of course those cost extra. Oh another advantage is the the bulbs are dimmable. So you can control the brightness without a dimmer switch. With Amazon Echo you can tell it what % you want them to glow. \"Alexa living room lights on at 50%\".... Kind of cool."}

A trivial note is on their FAQ page they don't capitalize \"Windows\" but it looks to me now that it was a sign of the trip down the drain later.

They are charging $45 for light bulbs yet they can't get it to work with a tablet. I contacted their tech support to complain and I was a bit miffed when I did. After a bit of sarcasm on my part they told me to come back when I had USEFUL suggestions. Nice way to take it personally. Finally I have one bulb that hasn't started to work yet. I'll troubleshoot. Might be my problem. I'm 90% everything that I bought for it will be going back. I don't know how long Android support has been available but all the paperwork that was in the boxes said Apple products were needed to get it to work.

I plugged it in different outlet, but it didn't turn on. I contacted the customer service through their website and haven't received any response in more than two days. I called Philips Customer Support yesterday and they want me to send the defective bridge first and then only they will ship the new bridge and the customer support was unable to confirm that I will receive a new bridge not a refurbished one. I find this to be a bad policy, where customer is stuck with bad product and replacement won't be send to me, before the defective product is sent back. Plus a bridge shouldn't go bad within 8 months of purchase - speaks volume to their quality assurance. To make matters worst, all of Hue bulbs are dumb bulbs now, it is beyond me that even though they are recognized by my Echo Dot, why can't Philips program them to follow routines set by Hue Bridge. I feel stuck right now and in future will plan to switch to a bridge-less configuration for my smart light needs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI have been using Philips Hue kit for couple of days now and the initial set-up was somewhat of a pain. Mainly because the instructions regarding how to pair bridge with the Hue App are sparse in their packaging and the fact that they label their hub as \"wireless bridge\", I assume that means you don't need to connect to your internet router via ethernet cable. However, in my case it didn't work and it only paired with the app, when I connected using ethernet cable, which is disappointing as I have limited ethernet outlets on my router and it creates more mess on my desk.\n\nOther than this issue, everything else works as described.

I did this and now the Hue Bridge and lights seem to be working without issue including through HomeKit. Happy to get things working, but they really should tell you up front their product does not work with some hardware. I spent way too much time trying to get things to work and too much frustration when I would go into app to change lights and would not have a connection. I'm leaving rating at 2 stars, but I imagine if I had a Netgear to start with and not had these issues it would have been 4 or 5 stars.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nI installed this a couple of weeks ago after witching from TCP lighting (they quit supporting their product).\n\nDay 1 was complete frustration. Getting the bridge to connect was brutal. It set up initially, but then was constantly cycling between being connected and not connected. This was occurring while I was trying to get my lights set up which was extremely frustrating. I did manage to get all lights working and programmed (I was leaving town next day and wanted these running while I was gone), but with a lot a patience since it would \"connect\" then I'd start doing something, it would then lose connection and re-establish connection. I would lose whatever routine I was in the process of setting up and have to start over. If I had not been leaving town next day, I probably would have just quit.\n\nThe interesting thing on the connection issue is in the app it would sometimes be connected within the network (green \"connected\"), so I could use iOS HomeKit. Sometimes it would connect \"out of home connection\" even though I was in home and on same network , so I would have to use the Hue app. And sometimes it would just not be connected even though all lights on the bridge were on and not flashing (note sometimes the third light for internet will be flashing). Anyway I left town and checked remotely and it seems the lights were coming on as programmed.\n\nAfter returning home the connection issue has been more intermittent (vs. constant before I left), but still occurs daily. Any given day I will go into HomeKit and sometimes have access, sometimes not even though I am home and on same network as the bridge. Then I have to go to the Hue app. And sometimes the bridge is just not available regardless of which app I am trying to use. Really unhappy when that is the case. Also, when home I want to use HomeKit. I like the idea my family does not need to install the app on their phones and can use HomeKit, but that is often not the case.\n\nI love the home automation. I had a TCP system before and never had a problem, but switched when that company quit supporting the product. I went with Hue based on decent ratings and HomeKit compatibility. I want to give this a better rating, but the daily intermittent connection issues are killing me. For the money I paid I need to be able to access lights to turn on or change settings whenever I go into the app. All too often this just is not the case."}

I decided to simply not use the location features.\n\nAs a minor complaint, the app could use a little bit of work. If the app was already launched and running in the background, it never seems to recognize the Hue bridge when I connect at home. I always have to exit the app and launch it again. Also, scheduled routines cannot be edited while away from the home network. Any edits I make while I'm away will fail to save until I try again at home."}

Plugged it in and told ECHO to search for devices. After a pause, ECHO said \"If this is a Phillips Hue you must press the blue button.\" Wow. You can dim it to any percentage and control each bulb individually. I went into the ECHO app and grouped named it \"LIGHTS\" with light1 and light2. Make sure you use a name that ECHO hears clearly. I originally name the group \"Wall Lights\" and was often misunderstood. The bulbs are soft-white which give a nice warm yellowish light to a room. I bought this as a frill to play around with and it has turned out to be anything but frivolous. It is really convenient. I had to hide the switch (which must always be turned on) because I kept going on autopilot and turning the lights off. Put the app on my Fire HDX tablet which worked in seconds but that was a frill. It's really expensive but with the bridge you have a lot of flexibility for the future. Like to do my ceiling lights but I get vertigo on the first step of a ladder and my ceilings are high. Maybe next year."}
{"Author": "Amazon Customer", "Date": "on October 15, 2016", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "really wanted to like this product", "Text": "I really, really wanted to like this product. A friend recommended it to me to help me wake up in the mornings, and so I ordered the product. I followed the very limited directions, and the bridge showed that it was connected to the wifi (all three lights illuminated). However, I could not connect to the bridge from my smart device. I tried the Hue App, HomeKit, and a couple of other apps. I tried on several smart devices. I manually input the Bridge's IP Address. I reset the bridge, reset my router, reset my smart device. Nothing. Believing the bridge was defective, I returned it. I bought a second starter kit at Best Buy, and had the same problem. I tried the same troubleshooting I contacted Philips Hue Customer Care--went through all of their suggestions.\n\nI spent HOURS trying to get this to connect to my smart device. The Hub's ID number showed up in the Gen 1 app, so clearly it was creating some signal, but I never was able to connect to the bridge. My boyfriend, a radio frequency engineer with 16 years in wireless, could not get it to work. He logged into the router, tried to access the bridge using command prompt, NOTHING worked. Philips Hue finally just told me I must have received a defective device.\n\nSo, as I see it, one of two things has happened here, and either would make this product deserving of a one star review. The first is that Philips has produced so many defective Hubs that I was able to purchase two devices from two different retailers and managed to get a defective product both times. The second, and more likely, issue is that the bridge was not compatible with my router. This is problematic because Philips does not specify in the product's poor excuse for a manual, on its website, or anywhere as far as I know, any router or network requirements to use this product. Their customer care could not tell me whether this was a problem with the router--they believed it to be a defective product. Without any information available as to what I would need to look for in a new router, or whether that is actually the issue, I cannot justify spending another $70 on a new router and resetting my network in hopes that it MAY solve the problem. I am very disappointed in this product."}

These lights are the next best thing and probably better in some ways. Once the package arrived, I was up and running in less than ten minutes. The bridge connects directly to the router and is little enough that it didn't make my already very full entertainment center look any more crowded. The app was a quick download and easily found the lights right away and was very intuitive - I didn't need directions to figure out anything beyond the initial set-up. I did need to search for the Hue Ambiance I ordered separately, but once I found my way around the app, that was really simple too. You can dim the lights directly from the app home screen and after you create a log-in account, you can control the lights even when you aren't home. I haven't had any issues yet with the router in the basement not reaching the upstairs or outside light, so the range has been fine. I'm still trying to work out the coming home and leaving feature that is based on GPS, but I'm hoping this will be a breeze once I have more time to play with it."}

Connect hub to your router (hard wired, had hope it was WiFi), and make sure it has power and put two light bulbs in an area you want to use them. Load the app on your phone and follow the directions.\nIt was simple and it was easy.\n\nWHY, I WANTED THIS\nI\u2019ve lived in this house 23 years. There has never been a way to turn the foyer lights on from the garage in all that time. Electrically it would cost more than you might think due to the amount of wires in that area and switches. Instead $60 later I have a more flexible solution.\n\nMy phone can turn the foyer wall light on, if I\u2019ve realized I forgot to leave it on, right from my car, as my phone will connect with the wireless from the driveway. Similarly I can turn a kitchen light on as well. Neither of these needed any special color, so the plain white Hue bulbs worked fine.\n\nTO ADDRESS NOT NEEDING TO USE A SMART PHONE, PAIR IT WITH A LOGITEC POP.\nWhat prompted me to finally go with this solution, is that I could eliminate the use of the smart phone with a simple little electronic switch. Inside my garage is a Logitech POP and if I tap this once, it turns on the foyer light, twice the kitchen light and a long press turns on both.\nThis seems like a lot of technology to do such a simple thing, but the wiring to do this would be formidable. This is one of the few lightly solutions that work with the POP and this is why I bought the Phillips Hue.\n\nAMAZON ECHO:\nYes, now I can talk to my lights and tell the Echo to turn them on or off. I had not thought of this till I saw it on the box. Handy.\n\nWORKS WITH APPLE AND ANDROID:\nI was very disconcerted when I saw the box as it gave the illusion that it only worked with Apple devices. While I have an ipad, I have an Android phone. I\u2019m happy to report that it works with both and the info was included.\n\nISSUES:\nOne of my Phillips lights never turns fully off though the app says it\u2019s off. I have an email into customer service at Phillips to see if there is any recourse to fix this. I will let you know how that turns out. So far I have waited a week. There is a do not reply on their reply to me, so I can\u2019t quickly ping them, but would have to get back to them via the web site. Hence the 3 stars. Would be 5 if it worked or Phillips responded in 24-48 hours.\n\nUPDATE ON ISSUES:\nPhillips came through for me. Shortly after I posted this review, a rep contacted me and sent me a label to mail back the bulb in question. I have the new one and it works great.\n\nFor years I dealt with a difficult lighting situation in my foyer and this solution works great for me. Paired with Amazon's Echo. I tell the light to turn on before I leave and using the Logitech Pop switch in the garage I turn it off. I could also use my phone."}

Perhaps it's a force of habit, but I find it cumbersome to go to my phone to turn the lights off. It is pretty cool, though, to turn the lights on from the car as I drive up to my apartment.\n\nI have had the problem of Siri not \"hearing back\" from the Hue base. I thought it was the base, but it turns out my phone hadn't connected to the wifi at home. I've been cursing the base at time, and it was actually my fault for not remembering to turn my phone's wifi back on.\n\nNot a bad device \u2013 it does everything it says it does \u2013 but just not a convenience that I'm finding all that convenient."}
{"Author": "born too late", "Date": "on September 14, 2016", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Very versatile!", "Text": "I'm really quite pleased with how these work. I have mostly been using the bulbs with the Hue app and not so much with the Echo, although I do have one and like it. I will allow others with more experience to review the Alexa/Hue experience. I like using the app because I can precisely control both the brightness and the level of whiteness. I like these so much I went out and got a color hue bulb for a bedside lamp. The app allows me to separately adjust each light to get exactly the mood I want in the room. So in the morning I can have bright white light while I'm getting ready for work, and in the evening I can keep it soft, then turn off the room light altogether and adjust the bedside lamp to a soft blue-ish with just enough brightness for reading. It may be a fluke, but I have been sleeping better since I started doing this.\n\nBut even the white bulbs allow a range of adjustments, so you can have a bright white, or a soft yellowish. And the app allows you to set \"scenes\" using combinations from the various lights in the room. And one very cool thing I discovered is the ability to use a photo on my phone to set my own color scheme, thus I can enjoy the dimming glow from a Colorado sunset complete with rose undertones.\n\nAlso, you can purchase a 'switch plate' that requires no wiring. It is magnetized, and can be stuck to an old switch plate. It holds very well and is synced with the room lights, so you can still manually turn on room lights and control the brightness.\n\nOne note, the bridge must be hooked into your wireless modem, and it involves tapping the top button. If, as it is in my case, your modem is on a different floor, that means you must get the bulbs up and running, so to speak, while in the same room with the bridge. I solved this problem using a nearby lamp until the bulbs and my wifi had discovered each other. Then I moved the bulbs to the room I wanted them in."}

The Hue not only fails to give me simple options but sometimes doesn't opreate in reliable manner. 15 dollars for a sixty watt bulb with limited use is exensive but not as expensive as the other bulbs Phillips offers which are between $45 to $60 a piece. Much of what Hue attempts to do is to provide different colored lighting atmosphere for different occasion such a house party.

The challenge is programing the lights to do what you want, when you want. The website has very poor, unclear instructions. I have emailed support, and after waiting in excess of two weeks, don't ever expect a response. There is no clear way to program lights to come on at specific times, at specific degrees of power that you customize. Philips wants you to choose \"presets\" that they have determined. Part of the appeal of this system was that I believed I could program it how I needed. They recently upgraded the software, but to no avail. The buttons for navigating are not clear nor simple. This system needs an Apple like approach to make it seamless, until that happens you will be using ineffective presets. One more note, the one preset located in what Philips calls \"Wake up\", only works with the color bulbs and functions by slowing increasing the lights intensity. Sounds cool, except the white bulbs are not designed to slowly rise in intensity, however I cannot find where you can just have these lights to turn on instantly. Frustrating!"}

While you can create a schedule, that schedule is not stored in the HomeKit database, thus, other Homekit apps, like Elgato and iDevices will not be able to see the created schedules. If you create a schedule in iDevices, or Elagato, then those schedules, whiele stored in the Homekit database, will not be picked up by the Philips Hue ecosystem. This means, that if any schedules created by iDevices or Elgato, will only execute if you are on the same Wi-Fi network as the Hue hub. If you leave home, before the schedules are meant to execute, your lights will not come on and go off as scheduled. Same thing happens with the IOS 10 Home app. Unless Philips, fixes this issue, there is no way to push a schedule to the Hub from the IOS 10 Homekit app, or any other Homekit. You are forced to use their crappy app to execute something as simple as scheduling lights on and off.\n\nAlso, the bulbs in this set are more yellow than white. I was expecting very white light and what I got was a yellowish light coming from these bulbs. They are definitely not completely white. There is a yellowish tint to them that I was not expecting. It may not bother many people, but the true color tone should be noted in the description.\n\nLastly, I'm surprised at how badly the software is written. After reading the great reviews, I was expecting something really great. If you are comparing the app to the Generation one app, then it's better. if you compare the app to something like iDevices, Elgato Eve, or even Lutron, it's badly organized. For instance, when you set a schedule that executes everyday, you need to click the symbols for every day of the week. Most apps have an \"All\" button you can just click. When I set a schedule, they assume I want it to operate on a room, instead of an individual bulb, like every other app. The app has a look like it was written in the 80s instead of the 21st century.\n\nEvery time you launch the app, it seems like it wants to re-connect to the hub all the time. When you launch the app, there is a brief green sign that comes up and says \"Connected\" every single time it's launched and slows the app down. The act of turning the lights on and off, manually and on schedule, seems to work well. But the app as whole needs work."}

I can no longer connect additional CREE bulbs. It's apparently a known issue to the Hue team but, after two months, my bridge has yet to receive any updates that might fix it. Luckily the CREE bulbs I'd already set up weren't unpaired by the \"update\". From what I've read, this is the second time in less than a year that Philips has broken connectivity to third party bulbs with \"updates\" despite claiming to be fully Zigbee compatible. I might just throw my Hue Bridge in the trash and buy something else just to keep my blood pressure down. Save yourself some grief and buy another brand.\n\nAs a side note, just in case you're still considering it because it's cheap...the free Philips Hue app for Android is really lacking in both features and ease of use. The only reason I kept the app installed was in case there was another update the bridge firmware again. That was a huge mistake. If you get your system working, DO NOT update the firmware in your bridge. The Philips Hue team seem to go out of their way to break third party compatibility and then say \"oops, we really didn't mean to screw all of the third party hardware\""}

I was ready to venture into some of the other smart home lighting options that were capable of being controlled by Amazon Echo. I did quite a bit of research between LIFX and Hue and ultimately chose Hue. It came down to ease of use, reliability and sustainability.\n\nThese bulbs are pretty legit. Easy to setup and sync with Echo. So far, I have had 100% reliability with them working when told to (which is better than I can say for some of the smart plugs (TP-Link *cough*cough*)). I plan on growing the system from just my dining room to the kitchen soon and pretty much any ceiling fixture that isn't a fan (mostly because I am hoping some better approach to controlling the lights and fan through Amazon Echo comes out)."}

The app and or software in general was a no go. The main reason I wanted the system was to be able to set up schedules for the lights ( off when I'm at work, on when I arrive home from work, lights on when I wake up in the morning).. It worked for maybe the first day and that was it. I tried everything but the Hue app would never keep me logged in for some reason. I even tried other apps like Tasker and the old version of the Hue app which worked for about a day then nothing. The manual functionality to turn the lights on and off worked well but I should have been able to set up my schedules and let that be it. I purchased from Best Buy and returned them after about 5 days of troubleshooting."}

Hands free lights at home is like the sensor on/off lights at work. You don't want your lights at home to go on/off as you walk through so this system along with the echo integration provides you the best alternative. Washing something or got your hands tied up,, echo turn on the kitchen lights and there they go. Lying in bed and forgot to turn off the lamp, echo turn off the lamp.. boom. Set up is fairly easy although it needs a wired connection for the hub which I wasn't aware of until I started to setup. Download the skill in echo, plug in the hub, allow it to see the lights and then set up your bulbs on HUE,, then go to your alexa app and you can combine bulbs together to make rooms go on/off in groups."}

I rent so I can easily take with me should I move. bought on prime day so i saved a little money. regular price i think is expensive but if bulbs last it will be worth the investment. Hub was easy plug into outlet and ethernet cable gets plugged into router. download app and it finds your hub for set up.The app should be more dummy proof its rather confusing for first time users. My advice would be set up one area at a time (bathroom vanity light then hall then kitchen etc) Install bulbs turn on your switch to that area search for bulbs in app then name that room. when naming room you have to be specific echo only reads what you put in.now go back and repeat for hall kitchen etc. remember the numbers (bathroom is bulbs 1,2,3 etc) you will need for echo. then tell alexa to search devices she tells you to press hub but no need to you have already done this. go to alexa app and create group for each single or set of bulbs (this is where you name room) she will bring up ALL bulbs in numbers thats why you need to remember. take those numbers and create your group. (bulbs 1,2,3 was bathroom etc) check mark bulbs 1 2 3 create group and name bathroom. now you leave all switches in the on position. ask alexa to turn on or off and she will once you have created groups for all bulbs. the bulbs are for inside use ONLY not designed for outdoors also they are better suited for a lamp and not flush mount ceiling lights. the bulbs are not to be covered up (ie flushmount) the bulbs are heavy and get hot as well. I have owned operated for a couple weeks now and really enjoy of course if your wifi goes down you can still flip the switch to turn lights on and off."}

What's also nice about them is they are LED bulbs so they'll save energy and last for a very long time. Also compatible with Amazon Echo so anyone can control them through voice.\n\nThe app could use a lot of work however. One of the biggest features I would love to see added the the apps is security. Right now security is pretty simple, I activate my app, and one time only I click on the button on the hub and have access to every single bulb that's connected to it. I would love to be able to designate certain family members phones to be able to control only certain light bulbs. Their newer app also allows you to group bulbs together for simultaneous control but it doesn't allow a single bulb to be apart of multiple groups."}

I'm replacing my old fashioned remote lights and timers with modern smart home equivalents, and this was to be my replacement for a living room light and my bedroom light. Setup was a snap. I plugged the Hue hub into my ethernet switch, and the iPhone app quickly set thing up within about a minute. The Hue app worked great, but I could not for the life of me get it to pair with Siri--which was the whole point of buying this. I finally found something one the Internet where someone else had had the same issue and got it to work by plugging the Hue hub into the router directly, not a switch. I tried and was instantly rewarded with the hub pairing to Apple's Home Kit and Siri. Anyone else with this problem would be advised to give this a try.\n\nI am now able to set up schedules for the lights to go on and off, and can control them lights by telling Siri to turn the on/off or dim them.

Lucas", "Date": "on April 21, 2016", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "1 free A19 light with purchase of this kit.", "Text": "I have been eyeing the Philips Hue system for a while now. As someone who has paid his share of early adopter tax I figured I would wait this one out a little bit until the 2nd generation came out. I am glad I waited. I have read some of the reviews of folks who purchased earlier units and to say that it wasn't smooth sailing is an understatement. But enough of the past let's talk about the current state of technology.\n\nINCLUDED IN THE BOX:\n2 Philips Hue 60 Watt equivalent WARM Bulbs\n1 Power Transformer (120VAC to 5 volt DC)\n1 Philips Hue Ver 2.0 controller (Version 2 is square, Version 1 is round)\n1 24 inch Cat 5 ethernet cable\n1 Quick Start Guide\n1 FCC Compliance Card / Warranty Card\n\nSetup was a breeze in fact it took me longer to purchase my Hue kit than it did to set it up. I did not purchase my kit from Amazon because a local big box home improvement store had the kit on sale cheaper and I was able to pick it up tonight. Luckily for me this was a local purchase because the first Hue kit was DOA. I plugged the Bridge into the wall and no lights turned on. I placed my amp clamp around it the wire and power supply and no juice was flowing. Hopped back in the car and did a quick exchange and the second kit has been flawless.\n\nSetup is roughly 3 steps.\n1.) Twist light bulbs in, turn on light bulbs. (Leave on)\n2.) Plug Phillips controller into home router, you need 1 ethernet port on your internet (WiFi) connected router. Plug hub into power from included transformer. Plug transformer into live electrical outlet.\n3.) Download Hue app to phone or tablet.\n\nAssuming you followed those instructions in order, you should have no problems. Once you start the app the Hue will guide you through setting up your bulbs and adding them to your system as well as Siri voice control if you are into IOS. Otherwise it works with Amazons Echo device as well. I'm sure Android works.\n\nThe hue comes with a few scenes setup for you already amongst these are:\nAll Off\nTwilight (Maybe 20% on)\nSnooze (For alarm clock mode)\nRise and Shine (Slowly brings lights from dim to full power)\nRead (Maybe 60% on)\nFull Bright (100% on)\n\nYou can change any of those presets or create your own scenes with different lights at different levels. Since this is the white kit, dim or bright is about as exciting as it gets.\n\nAs far value is concerned. If you are looking to get into smart home technology and specifically the Philips Hue system on the whole this is a great kit to dip your toes in without going full monty right away. I looked at the Hue starter kit Philips 456210 Hue White and Color Ambiance A19 Bulb Starter Kit 2nd Generation, Works with Alexa with the 3 full color + white led bulbs and while it is a decent value @ $200 if those are the types of bulbs you are interested in it was not exactly what I wanted.\n\nInitially I was going to buy just the Philips 458489 Hue Bridge - Frustration Free Packaging, 2nd Generation which is currently retailing on Amazon for about $60 Prime. When I found this starter kit at the big box store for the price of the Philips Hub and a Philips White A19 I was essentially getting a second Philips White A19 bulb for free. Pretty sweet deal and I recommend it if you want to get into this technology but aren't looking to drop a whole wad of cash on your initial purchase or if the starter kit doesn't have the types of bulbs you want.\n\nPersonally I am going to be building my system out with the Philips Par Philips 456673  Hue White and Color Ambiance Extension Par16 Bulbs, 2nd Generation and Friends of Hue Philips 259960 Friends of Hue Personal Wireless Lighting Iris Single, Frustration Free around my home. I like the light to be seen and not the bulbs so I will be bouncing the lights off of diffusion fabric and ceilings and walls so the room is bathed in a glow of non directional light. I will post photos later after I have built my system out.\n\nApple Watch integration is neat. You can use either your phone or you watch to issue commands to Siri. Of course there is a minor delay built in between Siri understanding the command and then relaying it back through your phone to the hub. It's faster to pick your pre-canned scenes from your watch, they execute almost instantly.\n\nAll together it took me longer to get a working starter kit than it did to setup this system. I have started to order the bulbs and fixtures for my new system and I cannot wait to have it all installed."}

Put the light bulbs in your lights, plug in the bridge, download the app. Off and running. These are really wonderful. It was just as easy to connect these so I could control them with my Echo. Now I walk into the house with a double armload of groceries or gear and say, \"Alexa, TV room lights, 80 percent.\" I hear Alexa says \"Ok\" just as my TV room lights turn on to 80% brightness. I go through my evening, crawl into bed and then it's, \"Alexa, all lights off.\" They all turn off and I head off into dreamland. I have my Nest thermostat hooked up to my Echo as well. Slowly but surely I am turning my home into a smart house that I can take with me when I move. I think that's the best part. I can create a complete and total smart house, but if I move, I don't have to start over or yank a bunch of wiring. I just unscrew the bulbs, unplug the bridge, unplug my echo and Nest and take it all with me. No need to invest more money on the next house to get it how I want it again! Single investment is a wonderful thing!"}

Thought about calling the electrician to move the switches, but this turned out to be a whole lot cheaper. With this gadget, you no longer need to use the switches, so I can cover them with the pictures. First replace the bulbs with the Hue bulbs. Switch them on and leave the switches on. Connect the Hue bridge power cord to an outlet near your router or access point, and then connect the included ethernet cable from the bridge to the router or access point. Download the Hue app to your smartphone (mine is a Samsung Galaxy 4), install it and open it. It finds the bridge and the bulbs quickly. The app allows you to rename the lights to something more practical than the default \"lamp 1\" and \"lamp 2.\" Worked instantly the first time. Then the cool part. It took her 3 tries, but Alexa (Amazon Echo) found the lights with the names I gave them. Now I just say, \"Alexa. Turn the south porch light on,\" and she says, \"OK,\" and she does! Same thing with turning it off, and same thing with the north porch light as well. Don't need the light switches anymore, and my wife can cover them with her pictures."}

{"Author": "Victor", "Date": "on April 11, 2016", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great LED bulbs and connectivity, a bit spendy, but very much worth it!", "Text": "So, when I initially purchased this Philips Hue starter kit, I had it in my head that this was nothing more than an expensive novelty to add to my Amazon Echo (pretty sure my wife thought the same thing!) I'm a techie and love this kind of stuff! So, I was super excited when the package arrived. I immediately opened it all up, installed the bulbs into the 2 lamps in the living room and hooked up the Hue bridge. After downloading the app from the Play store, I fired her up. It was a very simple process. Check it out, I can control the lights from my phone! Sweet! Next, I opened the Alexa app and connected the bulbs. I named the simply \"Living Room 1\" and \"Living Room 2\" with a group containing both called... wait for it... \"Living Room\". So, now, I can control them individually or as a group with my voice! RAD! Expensive? Yes. Novelty? Probably. Totally awesome? Um, yes!\n\nThe app...\nThe official Hue app is, a little lacking. I feel the interface could use some polish and some functionality tweaks, but, it serves it purpose. Most of the time, Alexa handles the lights... she's so nice. However, there is something that I do use on a daily basis, and that is the alarm.in my household, we all get up at about the same time. So, I have an alarm set every morning where the lights will fade on over a few minutes time until they get to full brightness. My own simulated sunrise... on my time. Also, with Alexa and the use of IFTTT (IF This Then That) I added a feature so when an Alexa timer goes off, the lights will pulse. This is handy if step out the back door, or am down the hall and don't hear the timer, I will certainly see the flashing lights.\n\nThe bulbs...\nThey look nearly identical to regular incandescent bulbs. I was a bit worried at first thinking that they may not be bright enough and that the warm tone might be too warm. Once I got them installed, I knew I made the right choice! I'm very glad I didn't go with a daylight white... the warm, more natural looking light is perfect! And, they seem a touch brighter than the previous CFL bulbs they replaced.\n\nBottom line...\nYeah, they're expensive. No, you don't really NEED them. But, they are pretty neat and handy to have. I will be expanding my Hue ecosystem soon!"}

{"Author": "Amazon Customer", "Date": "on March 28, 2016", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Incredible product - very straightforward and efficient.", "Text": "I bought the Hue White Starter kit (2 white bulbs only) to try it out in my room. I thought it would be another one of those \"good to have, cool\" but not really necessary items at home but honestly I think I was WAY off.\n\nLet's start off with the convenience factor. Installation took 10 seconds. Plug in the bridge and the internet cable, put the light bulbs in as any other light bulb would be installed and you're pretty much set (some minor wi-fi connectivity steps need to be taken when you download the Hue app, etc.). Now you're set and ready to control the lights with your phone or Siri/Alexa (depending on which lady keeps you company at home). I LOVE the fact that I can get into bed, read a book and then I don't have to get up to shut lights off when I want to sleep. The lights can also be dimmed which is an added bonus: \"Hey Siri, set the mood.\" (wink wink).\n\nThe app has many different settings that you can use to your advantage - you can set automatic timers to on/off (with alarms), you can set a proximity sensor that will automatically turn lights on when you arrive and off when you leave your home, and you can set an automatic \"off\" setting after certain amount of time to shut lights off for you and save electricity. My point is, you have many different ways to control the lights that allow flexibility.\n\nI can't leave out what I think provides the best value added for me. I usually have trouble waking up in the mornings. My room is dark, cold, and my bed is comfortable. I have the Sleep Cycle app (which is also great btw!), and the app can be connected to the Hue App so that they work together. The result? The Sleep Cycle app is supposed to monitor your sleep cycle so that it wakes you up within a 30 min (you can set the timeframe) timeframe when you're coming off the deep sleep and you wake up feeling rested. Once you connect the app to the Hue lights the app will automatically start to dim the lights on within that time frame to gradually get you to come off that deep sleep prior to having the alarm go off. It's been day and night for me, literally as I'm able to get out of bed faster. That by itself is worth the cost of the product.\n\nFinally there's so many different options and additional products you can buy to combine. I plan on buying more light bulbs so I can place around my apartment (you can pretty much control all the light bulbs in your apartment with one bridge, and you can name each bulb to separately control them if you want to). You can also buy light switches if you prefer to have a button to press and control the lights. There's really no negative I can find from this, and I'm being 100% honest!! If I do come up with a negative I'll point it out.\n\nGood luck!!"}

After making my decision, I found an open box model through Amazon Prime so I was able to purchase it for almost $10 cheaper than the full price of 79.99. Until purchasing this product, I didn't realize that open box models could be made through Amazon. To my delight, upon receiving the product, I couldn't even tell that it had been opened, everything was there, directions and cords. It was fairly intuitive and easy to follow the directions given to set up. Presently I am using mine with my Echo system and love it.\n\nI have found that Hue can become confused if you turn the lights on by Siri and then attempt to turn them off using Alexa. It has had a slight learning curve to it, but nothing major and I plan on adding other bulbs soon. One disadvantage, Philips does not make a small bulb and I have one lamp that this bulb will not fit into. Also, if you are looking for plugs, Philips does not make these either."}

The Hue bridge and lights worked great on their own, and Alexa worked great on her own, but the two couldn't find each other. I tried every online troubleshooting tip I could find, and went so far as to completely reset my Echo and the Hue, meaning I had to reinstall and run full setup again. No fun, and still no joy.\n\nAlexa knows that Hue bridges sometimes talk to her and sometimes don't. She apparently doesn't take it personally, but she mentions this hub by name and offers unsolicited troubleshooting tips during every random device discovery attempt, even if you have no Philips devices. According to many online forums, the 2nd gen Hue hub has been randomly having connection problems with Echo since mid-2015. Software updates and device reboots have not resolved the issue as of my purchase date.\n\nI initiated a return of this item because I bought it to specifically use with Echo; two days later while I was getting ready to pack it up and ship it back I decided to try it one last time just for the heck of it. \"Alexa, discover devices....\" And wonder of wonders, whattayaknow, \"I have located 2 connected home devices.\" Go figure! What's funny, is that Echo still finishes up with the standard message that if you were trying to discover Philips Hue bulbs, you might want to press the button on the Hub and try discovery again. The fact that she says this every time, by default, even if she already found your device, tells you that this has been a frequent and widespread problem.\n\nAll I can say is that if you buy this item and it doesn't work at first, I can't explain it--and apparently neither can Amazon or Philips--but let it sit all connected and powered on for a day or two and try again. They might suddenly start to click. From what I've read, and now experienced, it seems like these two tend to randomly hook up when the mood strikes just right. Once my Echo found my bulbs, they work perfectly together....so far, anyway. I did see some reviews/online comments that mentioned these two randomly losing their connection, too. I guess time will tell if they stay faithful to each other or drift apart.\n\nThere is also some question of whether this hub will continue to be compatible with any 3rd party devices/bulbs; apparently Philips plans to change the software so that their hub only works with their products. I hope that is not the case, but we'll see. In the meantime, Hue and Alexa are happily paired and making beautiful light and music together. So far the relationship has been worth a little work. Hope this helps if anyone else bought this to use with their Echo."}

I screwed them into lamp sockets, turned on the switch to those sockets, and the hub detected them as online quickly.\n\nWith the app, you can control the bulbs individually, or as part of a scene. There were some pre-defined scenes, and you can create new ones. For example, a scene could set both bulbs to 50% brightness. Or it could turn one on and the other off. You can also set timers to have the lights turn on / off at specified times.\n\nSo what are the other features? Create a Philips Hue account, and additional features become available. Without an ID, you need to be on the same network as the bridge in order to control the lights. With an ID, you can do it from anywhere. You can also control the lights through IFTTT. For example, you can have the lights blink if you receive an email.\n\nAs with any other ZigBee Light Link systems, there are some limitations, and there are work-arounds. In order for the light to be controllable from your phone (or through Apple HomeKit, Amazon Echo, IFTTT or timer), the socket it is screwed into needs to be left on. You can turn it off from the wall - no power, no light - but you will then need to turn it on from the wall. Fortunately, turning on power to a bulb that has been powered off always puts it to max brightness, so if the bridge fails (like it did with my Belkin WeMo) you can still use it like a normal light bulb.\n\nZ-Wave wall switches works the way regular wall switches do, and you can control it both from the wall switch as well as from remote controls or a gateway. Installation, however, is a much more tedious process, unlike these lights. To install a smart light, you screw it into the socket, and you're done. Philips appear to have wall mountable switches that I need to look into.\n\nThere are many things I'd like to explore that I haven't had a chance to yet, such as their API. I will update this review when I do. In the meantime, I already like this better than the WeMo kit I had.\n\nUpdate 1 : Added two GE Link BR30. Reset them according to instructions found online (off for 3 seconds, on for 3 seconds, repeat cycle 5 times until bulb dims and blink once). Adding was very straightforward. Bulbs do seem unresponsive sometimes, especially if commands are issued rapidly. For example, if sliding it down to turn off, it might get stuck at partially dimmed. Need to explore this in greater detail. With Philips bulbs there are no issues.\n\nUpdate 2 : Attempted to add the WeMo bulbs. Managed to reset them according to Belkin's instructions, but was unable to connect it to the bridge.\n\nUpdate 3 : The bridge has a REST interface, meaning it is very easy to develop for it. You don't need a Philips Hue account for this. Documentation is quite good and libraries in different programming languages are available.\n\nUpdate 4 : Philips Hue Dimmer Switch - this is what will make the system complete. Works great - read my review on the switch if you're interested. I find that it works better if I have it controlling a scene rather than a bulb, even if the scene only contains one bulb, if I want \"On\" to always turn a bulb to 100% brightness instead of previous level before it was turned off."}

When you're on vacation, you can set random schedules, or manually come in and adjust the lights. Remember this is a white light kit only, and there is no color to the bulbs. Some of the other Philips products do have color changing LED bulbs.\n\nInitially I set this up with the included hub. I will try removing the hub and tying directly into my SmartThings V2 hub when I get a chance.

{"Author": "Super Mum", "Date": "on February 22, 2016", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "One star lost for Siri/Apple HomeKit issues, other than that, I LOVE the Hue system...", "Text": "This is my second Philips 455303 Hue White Starter A19 Kit, 2nd Generation. I purchased the first in October 2015 and, the second, I obtained via the Vine Program last month. The main reason I invested in the Hue system was due to its Apple HomeKit integration. Unfortunately, this has been the biggest let down of the Hue system. Fortunately, there is so much I love about Hue I am willing to forgive (and hope that Apple and/or Philips figures this out eventually).\n\nPros:\n\n- Lights go on and off via app and switch instantaneously. Absolutely no lag and that is a beautiful thing.\n\n- In several rooms of my house, I have pull-string lights. Yes, I live in a charming little village in a \"darling\" old house but the reality is, there is nothing charming about pull-string lights after 15 years. Walking blindly into a pitch black room at night grasping around for a string while stubbing toes is infuriating after a couple months and crazy-making after 15 years. Adding Philips Hue lights and Philips 458158 Hue Dimmer Switch - Frustration Free Packaging to the kitchen and bedrooms has made my life so much better! (No exaggeration.) I just stuck (via included magnet and purchased 3M tape, depending on the room) the switches by the entrances to each room and now I have an easy (and painless way) to turn on/off or dim the lights. This in-and-of-itself is the reason I truly love the Hue system. My toes and shins are happy campers and there is no need to go hunt down my iPhone to use the app to turn off/on or dim a light.\n\n- As for the included white Hue bulbs, I love that I can tailor the warmth and coolness depending on mood, headache, or the need to have a bright blinding bulb to stay super alert and focused.\n\n- I love the \"fun\" Hue add-ons in addition to the more functional pieces of the Hue ecosystem. Particularly, we enjoy the Philips 800284 Hue Lightstrip Plus, 2nd Generation which lights up the back of my entertainment center and makes us feel like we are at a movie theater and, my personal favorite, The Bowl of Light AKA Philips 798835 Hue Go Personal Wireless Lighting which is a great, and safe, alternative to lighting a candle. Of course we also adore our Philips 456186 Hue White and Color Ambiance Extension A19 Bulbs, 2nd Generation but find we don't use them in color as much as we do in plain white (which is just so darn functional in everyday life).\n\nCons:\n\n- While the app and wall switch are flawless, there are many hiccups with HomeKit integration. Siri has plenty of problems turning off and on lights/scenes and I am so tired of hearing him (yes, my Siri is a he) telling me he can't \"do that right now\" or \"can't reach all my devices at this time\" or \"hmmm, I'm having trouble enabling your XXXXX scene, try checking your devices\" or the other phrases that haunt me on a regular basis. While I have no idea if this is on Philips or Apple's end, this is the main reason I purchased the bridge back in October and has been the biggest disappointment thus far. While I purchased Hue for Siri integration, it was so that I could solve the pull-string light problem mentioned above. However, once Philips introduced the Philips 458158 Hue Dimmer Switch - Frustration Free Packaging the Siri issues weren't nearly as bothersome and, frankly, I like the wall dimmer switch better as my phone is often in an inconvenient location and the switch is always on the wall, right where I, and company who come to visit, can always find it.\n\n- The final nit-picky con is that, prior to purchasing the Hue system, I had a dozen or more Zigbee bulbs that were compatible with the Hue system. However, every so often Hue chooses not to support them... then to support them... then not to support them. While I understand that Hue wants people to purchase their bulbs (both to make money and to be able to make a reliable system that their customer service is able to support as a whole) I am slowly purchasing Hue bulbs to replace the other Zigbee bulbs so I don't have days where the non-Phillips bulbs work/don't work."}

I like my old kit and it integrated with my Amazon Echo (Alexa) and recently my 1st generation FireTV (now with Alexa). The new generation adds Apple HomeKit compatibility and has different bulbs that are a bit more than 10% brighter.\n\nLike the first gen hub you can control your lights from anywhere through the Philips Hue app. This generation has all the features of the older one and just adds to them.\n\nIntegration with Alexa/Echo is great for Philips bulbs and switches. I have never been able to get 3td party bulbs or switches to work with Alexa using the Philips Hue hub even though most work fine with the Hue app! If you want a all-Philips environment for Alexa voice control it's great but another hub might be a better choice for Alexa control of bulbs and switches from other manufacturers.\n\nI'll use this review to compare the first and second generations. I liked my first gen kit and I like the new one but it's not all rose petals.\n\nIN THE BOX:\nThe contents of the new kit are much like the older one:\n+ Hue square bridge (the older model had a round bridge)\n+ 2 Philips 455311 Hue White Extension A19 Bulbs (Old kit had Philips 433714)\n+ Power adapter (2A output compared to 800ma on previous)\n+ About 3ft LAN cable (same as the older one)\n+ Various getting started and marketing paperwork (similar to the older)\n\nThe biggest changes are the new bulbs are slightly brighter, run hotter and are shaped more like incandescent bulbs. The hub is square, requires a little more power, and now supports Apple HomeKit. The power adapter is bigger and I had to move around plugs on my power strip so it would fit.\n\nINSTALLATION:\nWarning: I wanted to see what a new install would be like, but if you are upgrading I suggest pairing your bulbs to your old hub first, then migrating your configuration to the new hub. I wanted to experience a first-time installation for this review and didn't do that, and oh what a PAIN!\n\nNew Install:\nIf Installing the new gen kit as a new first time installation, it is wicked easy! Install the hue app (I had it installed on my iPhone already), create or login to your account, discover the bridge, search for new devices. If the included bulbs are on they will auto pair. Easy Peasy! I did this first.\n\nUpon installation I was asked if I wanted to add the device to my home (Apple HomeKit)., This is new with this generation and nice to see and be able to use Siri as an additional voice control channel to Alexa.\n\nUpgrade Install:\nInstalling as an upgrade was not so nice.for me as I had already setup this hub as a new install. During setup the app *really* wanted to migrate my old hub's configuration to the new hub - the dialog in the app leads me to believe that they can not coexist so nicely. In the process of the upgrade the new bridge's configuration was cleared, the old hub's devices migrated to the new one. Then the old hub's configuration was then cleared.\n\nDuring the upgrade I was warned I would have to re-pair any previously pair devices or bulbs like those included in the kit. When I went to pair those nice new bulbs. What was previously seamless and easy before became a frustrating task. I finally had to resort to manually pairing the kit bulbs manually by using their serial numbers then doing them one at a time. It was an annoying pain that took several tries.\n\nI was also able to pair a new Cree Connected 60W A19 LED Light Bulb manually. The trick with the Cree is to make sure you start the manual paring immediately after turning on the bulb. The timing is very close with the Cree and it took me two tried to get it paired. This was the same experience as with the old Hue hub.\n\nOnce things were paired I was able to mate the new Hue hub with my Echo and Alexa happily turned my hue bulbs on and off, but would NOT recognize or control any of my Cree light bulbs connected to the Hue hub. The Hue app worked them perfectly. This is the same as the older bridge and still a rather annoyingly closed system.\n\nIN OPERATION:\nHomeKit compatibility is a plus for Apple users and gives a voice option other than the Echo (my preference). I've only just tried it a little so far. Alexa (Echo) is my home voice control preference.\n\nThe new bulbs are about 10% brighter and that's just noticeably brighter to my eye. The new bulbs are shaped more like incandescent A19 bulbs than the older style Hue Lux bulbs. Like the older Lux bulbs these are fairly heavy bulbs and may not be appropriate for some track lighting or swing-arm lighting fixtures. The Cree Connected bulbs are only a little heavier than incandescent bulbs and probably a better choice for more delicate fixtures.\n\nThe bulbs also seem to run hotter than the old ones. In an open socket the base got uncomfortably hot to the touch. In a similar situation the older bulbs got warm but never what I would call hot. I am concerned running hotter means a shorter life.\n\nSpeaking of shorter life, one of the two bulbs failed with between 1 and 2 hours of operating time. I turned it off and then it would never turn on again. A bummer for sure and I hope an anomaly.\n\nQuality of light from the new bulbs is not much different from the old ones. The lighting pattern does not seem much different even with the more round shape.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\nFor my environment where I am using the Hue app and Alexa/Echo the new generation offers little new. For HomeKit users this will offer new possibilities. If I had to pay for this upgrade I would have passed. If I were buying for the first time I'd get this new kit.\n\nFor new users setup could not be much easier, migrating from an old hub may be frustrating as it was for me. Maybe if you never pair the new bulbs or pair them with your old hub before migrating you will have a better experience than I did.\n\nPhilips Hue system seems to only begrudgingly support non-Philips devices. Echo can't control my Cree bulbs I connected through the Hue bridge. They work fine through the Wink hub with Alexa. Late in 2015 Philips released a firmware update that prevented pairing of non-Philips products, but quickly reversed that decision. Bottom line is this: If you want to stick with Philips I think the Hue is a great choice, but if you want a more open system select another option.\n\nAll things considered I think the Hue White Starter is a 3.5 star experience. 4 stars for a new user, 3 stars for a upgrade. No half stars so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and 4 stars it is.\n\nUPDATE: Jul 20, 2017:\nIn the year and a half since Feb 2016 the control hub has operated flawlessly, but one of the two bulbs stopped working. I didn't bother Philips about this as I had a spare bulb from another purchase. These newer bulbs do run hotter than the older ones so maybe it was heat related?\n\nI use the Hue system for controlling white lights. I don't use their color lighting and all my lights are plain old white dimming ones. The hub still does not support non-phillips devices with Alexa and that's a serious shortcoming for me. If I were an all Phillips household it would be great. Given I'm not, if I were to start over I would probably use a another zigbee hub that supports other branded devices with Alexa like my Cree brand smart bulbs, for example.\n\nIf you want great color lighting control with scenes I think this is a 5 star starter where you can add color lighting later. If you want to use non-philips branded devices it's probably 3 stars because Alexa control isn't supported."}

This item comes in a so-called frustration-free packaging, which is essentially a bare brown box (not retail). The item includes a network bridge, its power supply unit, an ethernet cable, and two \u201cwhite\u201d lightbulbs.\n\nSetting up is easy but it is important that you have an available ethernet port on your wireless router. I power up the bridge, connect it to the router using the included the ethernet cable, and then install and launch the Philips Hub app on my Android phone. Assuming your phone and the bridge are on the same network, the app will find the bridge automatically and ask you to press the (only) button the bridge to confirm. In my case, I managed to connect to my bridge in well under five minutes from opening the box.\n\nThe lightbulbs emits 800 lumen, which is about a 60W bulb. The color temperature is 2700K, which means it is like an incandescent light. Now this is really a yellowish light, so please be alert when you buy this. I don't know why they call this \u201cwhite\u201d. (I would consider 5000K white.)\n\nThe lightbulbs are dimmable, and you can use the app to set a timer (turn off) or an alarm (turn on). The alarm timing information is stored in the bridge, and therefore it does not need an internet connection. (I tested this by disconnecting the ethernet.)\n\nFeature-wise, Philips delivers all the promises and I have to give this a 5/5. However, honestly I am a bit underwhelmed with this kit for its price and performance ratio: it really does not do much other than dimming, and Philips is asking quite a bit more if you want color bulbs. The only redeeming feature is that the bulbs are LED and this kit includes two LED bulbs. However, considering that the traditional (non-smart) LED bulbs are so much cheaper, I find it a little hard for an apartment-living person like me to justify the current cost of this kit unless you like walking to your smartphone to change the light setting than to walk to a light switch."}

With the advent of the smart phone, our world has changed.\n\nFirst of all, these bulbs are great! The Hue system is very good, although trying to find a decent set of instructions for installation was difficult. Finally, the price of the bulbs that you can use is getting more reasonable each year.\n\nThe Phillips Hue White Starter A19 Kit contains 2 LED bulbs that emit 800 lumens of cool light (which is slightly above what we used to get from a 60 watt bulb), a WiFi Bridge, an adapter for the bridge, a short CAT5 cable for hooking the bridge to your wireless modem, and two HUE small pamphlets which have almost no instructions. The first pamphlet tells you to go to (...) to learn how to use the Hue lights. The second pamphlet tells you three steps to follow, in 20 languages. While the instructions one finds on the Phillips site are not specifically designed for these bulbs, there are some instructions that are very similar.\n\nIf you go to the Phillips site, and select the link \"Friends of Hue\" at the top, this will take you to their partnering page on Apple Homekit. If you scroll down to the bottom of that page, you will find instructions for using Siri, which are the same for these lights, instructions on setting-up Apple Homekit, which are very similar. Look over those to familiarize yourself to how these lights work. One thing I have noticed with the lights, if I enter the room where I have them plugged into lamp that turn-on and turn-off by the light switch, and I find them off. If I move flick the light switch back and forth, the lights come on.\n\nThe three steps they tell you about are: 1) Power Your Light Source(s), 2) Plug in the Hue bridge and connect to your WiFi router, and 3) Download the Hue app and follow the instructions.\n\nOnce you do these, your lights will work.\n\nUPDATE (2016/04) have my Hue lights installed in lamps placed on bedside tables in the bedroom. These lamps are placed in the electrical circuit that operates from a light switch on the wall at the entrance to the bedroom. On top of this, the light switch at the entrance to the bedroom is one that has a light in the switch that glows when the switch is turned off, and it is part of a two-way switch that has its paired switch on the wall next to the bed (which we do not use). By doing this, these lights now have these extra features if the lights in the lamps are turned \"on\" and left \"on:\"\n\n1) If I, or my wife, enters the bedroom and find the light switch switched down and glowing, we know the lights are off, and switching that switch at the entrance to the bedroom \"on\" with turn the two Hue lights \"on\" IF the Hue lights were switched on at each lamp when either the light switch at the bedroom entrance was switched \"off\" (by this I mean turning the lamps \"on\" and leaving them \"on\" as I said at the end of the previous paragraph) or we used the Hue app to turn the lights \"off.\"\n\n2) If we enter the bedroom and find the switch at the entrance to the bedroom switched \"on\" and the Hue lights in the lamps \"off\" (which means the Hue lights were turned 'off\" with the Hue app, not the light switch), switching the switch at the entrance to the bedroom \"off\" and then \"on\" will make the Hue lights turn themselves \"on.\" Thus, if my wife, or I, don't have our phones with us, we don't need our phones or the app to turn \"on\" the lights. When we leave the bedroom, we can turn \"off\" the light switch at the door, but doing so means we cannot turn \"on\" the lights using the app until the bedroom entrance light switch is turned \"on.\"\n\nI hope this doesn't sound more confusing than it needs to be. At this point, I could go into a lot of variables here that could happen, but it will just complicate things further. The good that comes out of the two points I have listed above is that if either my wife or I go to the bedroom and we find the two lamps \"off,\" we can turn them \"on\" without having to activate the lamps using the telephone app. For my wife this was a selling point that allowed me to install them, even though it meant there was one more electronic gadget in her life. She seems to think, sometime, I have electronic things in my life to keep her from using them, and we all know that is not true."}

The switch was easy to pair in the hue app and link the switch to both bulbs.\n\nBeyond simple on / off commands, here is my ranking of the multiple methods of controlling these lights:\n- The best is the hue app. Has the most control and the scenes are straight-forward.\n- Second is the physical Dimmer Switch, a couple of presses on bright/dim buttons and you can get the mood you want to quick.\n- Last are the voice controls, dimming presets are not available so you find yourself saying over and over \"Alexa dim the lights\" to get down to the level you want."}

In essence, these two setups are different ways to solve the same problem: wireless control of lights\n\nWith Wemo, you plug a device into your outlet that handles the wireless connection, and you use standard light bulbs. With Hue, you plug a device into your router and it communicates with the light bulbs.\n\nThe Hue setup was quick and easy. It took just three steps:\n\n1) Plug device into router\n2) Put the heavy (relative to normal bulbs) Hue light bulbs into lights.\n3) Install the app and follow its guidance to configure Apple\u2019s Home-kit. I used my iPad to do the setup. You have to press the big button on the Hue device and then everything starts talking. (Note: There is an Android App in the Google Play Store, but I have not tested it).\n\nSetup was quick and easy. My son really enjoyed telling Siri to turn the lights on and off.\n\nI have had trouble in the past with Wemos losing their capability to talk to the Wemo app. Only time will tell if Hue has a similar issue or not.\n\nYou do have to have your light switches in the On position for Hue to work. Because I am no electrician, I do not know if this causes electrical use or not when the HUE bulbs are off, but the light switches are on.\n\nSo that\u2019s basically it. It is quick and easy and so far works reliably. The bulbs are a lot more expensive than normal bulbs, so this may be a consideration for you.

I call Philips again to find out what's going on. This time, I was told that the support rep had completely mischaracterized the issues in their system, and they don't do replace bulbs as they had said on the previous call, that they only send out replacements after receiving the defective bulb back... and that even if they did, they don't have any replacement bulbs available right now. Given that I've had only half of what I ordered working, I have decided to return the product.\n\nThe other bulb and the bridge work fine, and I love the concept, but will do more research before purchasing a different brand.

{"Author": "J", "Date": "on January 23, 2016", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Love the system but not the iOS app", "Text": "The Hue lighting automation system is one of those things you never know you need until you try it. If you forget to turn a light off or on, just pull out your phone and do so. If your arms are full while entering a dark house, just tell your Echo to turn on the lights. If you're away from home and don't have a light timer, just turn the lights on and off from anywhere in the world. The Hue lights work via a first party app as well as through the Amazon Echo. The Echo integration is awesome. It gives true hands-free voice-controlled lighting without the need to pull out a smartphone and activate voice control beforehand. I definitely prefer it over the first-party iOS app. The app is buggy and requires the use of the iOS keychain which is also buggy. I stopped using the keychain in iOS and OSX last year after experiencing numerous sync problems caused by its bugginess, so I wasn\u2019t thrilled to be forced to use it again. It was also difficult to configure multiple handsets with the app. That\u2019s because it requires activating sharing in iOS keychain. Setting up two iPhones (my wife and I) to work with Siri voice control was a real pain. After doing so, I started encountering more issues, such as loss of contact between the iOS app and bridge. Overall, the iOS app is just clumsy and painful to set up and use if you have all but the most basic of needs.\n\nThankfully, the system works wonderfully easy with the Amazon Echo. Setup was a night and day difference from the iOS app. I simply asked Alexa to discover my devices, paired the bridge and created a new light group within the Echo App. Just like that, we had voice activated lighting. It is literally that simple and far easier than the Hue iOS app. We now almost exclusively use Alexa to turn off, turn on and dim the lights. The Echo responds instantly and I\u2019ve had no loss of connection yet between the Echo and the bridge. Best of all, the entire family can now use the Echo instantly and I\u2019m no longer forced to deal with the headaches caused by the Hue iOS app and iOS keychain. That doesn't render the app useless. Despite awesome localized performance, the Echo is only good over wifi and for basic commands (on, off, dim). If you want off network remote control, the ability to access several different lighting profiles, or the ability to control lighting from your smartphone (for instance if you're upstairs or downstairs and outside of the range of the Echo's hearing) you'll need the Hue app.\n\nThe bridge requires a direct ethernet cabled connection to the router. It is not a stand-alone wireless device. If, like me, you have an inaccessible or awkwardly placed router it may pose an issue. I had to get creative to connect the bridge to my router which is inside my foyer coat closet courtesy of a ridiculous Verizon rule requiring all new routers be connected directly to the ONT via ethernet.\n\nThe lights included with the starter kit have a warm color temperature similar to old-fashioned incandescent bulbs. They are not a cooler white temperature as the name may have you believe. Phillips offers a wide variety of bulbs and lights for the kit. If I didn't already own a Philips wake up light, I'd definitely consider buying the Phoenix lamp. App aside, this system is awesome so far and I can\u2019t wait to add new lights within the upcoming weeks to make the entire house and outside lights all smart controlled. Hopefully, the app gets its act together to make the entire bundle perfect."}

I use them with my Echo for voice-controlled lighting, and IFTTT and my SmartThings hub for automating lights based on time of the day and a bunch of other events.\n\nThese bulbs are easy to set up. You plug in the hub, use the app to search for new lights and if they are close enough, the bulbs will be found. If not, you can enter a serial number printed on the bulbs and the app will find them if your hub is too far away from your bulb. You can then control them using the Hue app or any number of third-party Hue apps available on Android or iOS. You can create groups or rooms so it is easier to control multiple lights at once.\n\nIf you want to get really fancy with your lights, try IFTTT, Samsung SmartThings Hub, 2nd Generation, Harmony remotes, or the Amazon Echo.\n\nUsing IFTTT, you can automate your lights based on a ton of conditions and events. Want to turn your lights on when rain is detected in your area? Yup, you can do that. Want to flash your lights when you get a new e-mail? You can do that, too. And it's free.\n\nSmartThings allows you to integrate these bulbs into your home automation network for controlling the bulbs with inexpensive Z-wave remotes, or turning them on when smoke is detected by your Z-wave smoke detector. SmartThings picks up the names that you give the bulbs (Living Room Couch) so they are easy to integrate into your events.\n\nSome Harmony remotes, like the Logitech Harmony Elite Remote Control (915-000256), will allow you to control these bulbs, too. It works great with my Elite and picks up the names that I give the bulbs in the Hue app. I can turn off these bulbs when I hit \"watch a movie\" on my remote.\n\nHue bulbs are expensive, but it is because of how many other things you can integrate them with. If you are a programmer, you can even easily control them in .Net, Python, and other languages.\n\nThese bulbs rock. And if you don't mind spending a bit more, consider the colored Hue bulbs or other Hue products like the lightstrips and spotlights."}
{"Author": "J. York", "Date": "on January 23, 2016", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "powerful and easy to setup", "Text": "I\u2019ve been using the second generation Hue bulbs for about 3 months now and have found them to work exactly as advertised. In the past I used the Hue color (\u201cambiance\u201d) bulbs but these new Hue white bulbs work just as well, albeit with fewer features.\n\nThe A19 designation means these are meant to perform as any ordinary household bulb would perform. They fit into any ordinary household light fixture. Philips claims that these are equivalent to a 60w bulb and I found the brightness and uniformity of the light are exactly what I\u2019d expect of a 60w incandescent bulb. These Hue white bulbs turn on instantly and have a pleasant color \u201cwhite\u201d color. Light comes out of all directions and once in a light fixture, there\u2019s really no way to tell that these aren\u2019t traditional incandescent bulbs. Philips does not specify a color temperature but to my eye these are 3000K when at full brightness. Not too blue, not too yellow: these are just right.\n\nInstallation requires you to screw these into your light socket but it also requires you to setup the included Hue bridge. The Hue bridge is the central brains of the Hue ecosystem and is what enables you to setup schedules on your bulbs and to remotely control them through your phone or through internet services such as IfThisThenThat.com (IFTTT).\n\nThis kit includes the late 2015 \u201csecond generation\u201d bridge (the newest one available as of January 2016). You attach the bridge to your wired home network and then install the \u201cPhilips Hue\u201d app on your phone. Using an iPhone, I ran this application and it automatically discovered my bridge and then added it to my home\u2019s wifi network. The entire process is well organized and as simple as possible. All-told, I had it up and running in only a few minutes. Once your bridge is working, you can pretty much forget about it and instead use the Philips Hue app.\n\nThe app will quickly discover any newly added bulbs and you can give them custom names so you\u2019ll know what is what. Conveniently, whenever you\u2019re editing a single bulb in the Hue app, that bulb will flash on and off.\n\nThese bulbs only support turning on and off and dimming. The dimming functionality is not that great because unlike a traditional incandescent bulb, these bulbs stay exactly the same color of \u201cwhite\u201d as they dim. This leads to an unattractive, dim white-ish color at the lowest levels. A traditional bulb would have skewed towards a pleasant orange-ish color. Still, if you want to have these behave like a 40w or a 20w bulb, the dimming functionality works perfectly.\n\nUsing the Hue app I defined a \u201cscene\u201d for my two bulbs to be fully on and fully off. I then created multiple \u201calarms\u201d for my bulbs that uses these scenes to turn them on around 5pm and off when I go to bed. I can also configure the brightness settings of the bulbs using the app. While Philips calls the feature \u201calarms\u201d, it is more of a schedule. One cool thing is that you can have the bulbs come on gradually or turn off gradually. So if you wanted to use this to wake yourself up in the morning, it wouldn\u2019t have to be a jarring brightness to start. Most importantly, the alarm functionality does not require your phone. You can power your phone off and everything will still turn on & off as you scheduled (thanks Hue bridge!).\n\nSo far I\u2019m enjoying the functionality of Hue. At the current prices, none of this is a good value. But it is easy to setup and reliability has been as rock solid as one would demand for a lightbulbs. Unlike a timer where you have to deal with circuit breakers or hiring an electrician, you can just plug these in and go. I\u2019m sold on Philips Hue and will continue to add to my system over time."}

It's a good thing that it's easy, because there really aren't any instructions. Once you have it installed, you can connect 50 bulbs, both white and color.

I've always dreamed of having a fully automated home that would respond to me entering a room or barking out commands sort of like Dave talking to HAL in '2001: A Space Odyssey'. As more and more home automation products are released that dream may come true some day.\n\nSetup of this kit was simple. Plug in the hub to your router and an AC outlet, screw in the two bulbs and you're done. I downloaded the Hue app onto both my Android tablet and my Android phone. I renamed the bulbs and then set up alarms for them. For example, I set up one alarm to turn the Family Room light on at 6:00pm and another to turn it off at 11:00. You can control each bulb (and anything you add in the future) individually or all together including a number of scenes and you can dim them. For example, you can turn all of your lights on or off at the same time.\n\nAfter the setup and generally playing around I went to my Amazon Echo and simply said, \"Alexa discover devices\". I had to press the big round button on the Hue hub and the Echo found it with no problem. Note - the Echo and the Philips hub are 35 to 40 feet from each other and there wasn't a problem with the signal. After the Echo added the devices I was able to control the bulbs with voice commands, \"Alexa turn Family Room on\" for example.\n\nA feature I had to research a bit was how to control the lights if I was away from my home, i.e., not on my home WiFi. The documentation that came with the kit wasn't much help but, after a few Google searches and reading the reviews here, I figured out that I needed to go to the my.meethue.com website, register and then the app would link to the website and allow me to control the lights. This is probably my favorite feature because I can now light up the house when I'm not home. I have two dogs so if I'm running late and it's getting dark out I can turn the lights on so they aren't home in the dark. It's also nice not coming home to a dark house. Oh, and it may keep criminals away.\n\nIn addition to the fairly basic functionality found in the Hue app you can install third party apps that provide a wide range of capabilities. The only one I've played with so far is a If This Then That app which is working fine.\n\nI plan on expanding this system over time. Someday I plan to ask it to do something and I'll be greeted with, \"I'm sorry Joe, I'm afraid I can't do that\". Dream fulfilled."}

I couldn't stop running off at the mouth (keyboard?) about \u201cPhillips hue Personal Wireless Lighting.\u201d My Reader's Digest version is: I LOVE this brilliant, easy to install and program, connected home device / lighting system and intend to expand it to the fullest degree possible because doing so will save money over time and give our home ambiance, comfort and convenience options that were never before possible.\n\nTwo wireless light bulbs and a \u201cbridge\u201d were included in our Phillips hue White Starter Kit. Set up was amazingly easy. First step was choosing two living room lamps and installing and powering on the bulbs. Then the included power supply cord and cat5 cable were plugged into to the bridge; then the other ends to the wireless router and the electrical socket. Next, on the Alexa app, under Settings, the Connected Home option was accessed and the Discover Devices option was selected. Within a minute, Alexa at first said that no devices were found, but gave instructions to push the button on the hue bridge and try again. The second time, Alexa announced that two devices were found and they displayed on the Alexa Connected Home screen. It was then possible to give Alexa voice commands to turn each on and off. Using the Groups option, the two lamps were identified as Living Room Lights. That made it possible to turn either lamp on and off individually, or both at the same time. From there, it at first looked like it would be more complicated to set up a schedule to turn either or both lamps on and off. If read correctly, it looked like we would need to connect another app called IFTTT in order to communicate schedule specifics to Alexa. The hue app that the hue pamphlet referenced wasn't installed because I mistakenly believed it was for IOS only. At my husband\u2019s suggestion, I checked and found it available through Google Play for Android. Once installed and updated, we created an online account. At home, the app\u2019s proved to work perfectly to control and schedule the lamps to power on and off. Away from home, the app is supposed to recognize that we aren't on our home network, and signs us into our online account to control connected devices via the internet. We'll primarily use Alexa to control the lights, but the app is handier (for now) for setting up a schedule, until I decide to learn IFTTT functionality. We have a couple of other brands of connected home devices, including a wall switch and two smart plugs. I wish that their installation had been as easy as Phillips hue devices. Going forward, for connected home solutions, I'll look to Phillips first before considering other brands. The bridge works with up to 50 connected devices; I'm excited to expand the hue system, especially to include color changing ambiance lighting. The dollar total necessary to change out all bulbs is big, so I'll do it a bulb / fixture at a time. In the long run, it's a move that will save money because (according to PC Magazine) the bulbs rate 15,000 hours life span and use 80% less power; eventually they'll pay for themselves. Phillips hue lighting is moving to the top of every birthday, anniversary, etc wish list I'll make in the next couple of years. Highly recommended!"}

And I do miss the full-color experience, but you can't fault a \"White\" bulb for not being purple.\n\nHere is the primary drawback: the cost of getting into this ecosystem and truly converting a whole room over to it is prohibitive. Yes, in time, it pays for itself in energy savings and bulb-use savings. But to just replace very bulb straight off? Ouch.\n\nStill, if you've can swing it, here's why it's worth it:\n\n1. Easy programming and setup. Seriously easy--push button, ready to go.\n\n2. Programmable with timer for wake up, programmable and effective with \"geofencing\" for location light turn on--lights come on when I get home.\n\n3. Connects to my Amazon Echo for voice control. Now, we don't have to find a phone or anything else to turn off the lights. And full hands when carrying items around still allow light control.\n\nI'm impressed. I'm not sure I'm \"Pay fifty bucks for more bulbs\" impressed, but it delivers on what it promises."}

It does not work well with Alexa Echo. Cumbersome and complicated. If I can't plug something in, push a few buttons and have it work, I don't want it. After 1.5 hours of work, I could only get it to 'discover' one of 3 light bulbs. And nowhere on the internet could I find this 'app' you are supposed to download. For set-up, your android (or PC) and Alexa must be located right at your router (which is down 2 flights of stairs in my house). Then if you're testing it, you have to run up and see if it's working. Which I would have put up with, but still couldn't get Echo to recognize more than one bulb. Also, the spotlight bulb is so small that if put into a recessed socket, you can see all the insides of the socket. The system will only control bulbs. If you want to control an appliance that has more than one bulb, you need many bulbs, Get a Wemo, is what I say."}

All you do is take the hub out of the box and plug in the A/C adapter and then the included Ethernet cable into your router. Then you download the app into your device; in this case that means my Amazon Fire HDX tablet. It also works great with iOS iPad's iPhone's etc. There is an app in the Google Play Store as well for Android.\n\nThen you open the app and it tells you to press the button on the hub, and then it automatically connects. Then on the next screen you have the lights that come with the kit. Turning them on via the switch on the light, and leaving it on makes it active in your Phillips Hue App. So it shows up in the device window. Then you can slide the bar across to fade or brighten the lamp as well as turn on/off.\n\nNow it gets interesting because you can use it with the Amazon Alexa to be able to control devices, lights in this example with just a voice command. So you actually go through the same pairing procedure with Alexa by telling her to discover devices. She then says, \"Push the button on the Hue hub\" and you do, and then let it go, and within 5 or 10 seconds she acknowledges that you are now connected.\n\nYou can then say to her, \"Alexa turn on Phillips Hue Bulb 1\" and she will. You can also tall her to make it softer, or brighter and she incrementally does so in small steps. Of course you can tell her to turn it on or off. However I renamed the bulbs in the Phillips Hue app in the Fire HDX and when I told Alexa to do the following with the renamed light of, \"Alexa turn off my bedroom light\" she said no such device found. So I had to re-pair with Alexa. That is super easy, just tell her to find devices, and she say press the button the Hue hub, and you only need to do so for a second, and then she now re-pairs, and uploads the new device names. So then I said, \"Alexa turn on my bedroom light\" and presto she did. I know this is going to make me sound like a dork but my favorite thing has become to get ready for bed, tuck myself under the covers, and say, \"Alexa turn off the bedroom light\", and her sweet caring affectionate voice says, \"Okay\". It's the last thing I hear before going to sleep at night. Sorry but I love it when a female voice says that. :-) I'm hooked.\n\nThis is just the beginning for me with automating my home. I'm looking forward to advancing to a comprehensive smart home. I like that I can download the Phillips Hue app to work in everything including my Android based phone, to my Amazon tablet, to my Apple iPad air. I kind of went crazy buying tablets mostly because I grew tired of being locked out of Android for example when I had my Windows based phone. The Amazon tablets are incredible for clarity, and entertainment purposes, as well as a myriad of different uses.\nSo I don't know about how this has worked for others, but all I know is it worked perfect for me right out of the box, no hassles, hiccups, or burps.\n\nOne last thought is that I have a projector screen that is used ideally in a totally black room. So unfortunately when I am done watching Amazon Prime movies for example, and I am remodeling my house, I have to get up while the projector is still on, climb over stacked rugs and more, turn a light on, and then climb back to the viewing chair, and then turn the projector off, finally leaving the room turning the light back off. So now with the tablet I just turn the light on in the chair, shut the projector down, and then leave the room.\n\nYou can also say, \"Alexa turn on my bedroom light in one minute\" and Alexa responds, \"Turning on bedroom light in one minute starting now.\" She started lighting up with the colors swirling and a pleasant tone so I said, \"Alexa what are you doing?\" and she replied, \"I am answering questions and learning more.\" So I guess she was updating. Okay maybe this review is starting to drift a little more into the Alexa realm, but the exciting thing is she becomes the main helper in complete home automation, and works beautifully with this Phillips Hue Lighting kit. No problems at all so far so I highly recommend it.\n\nUpdate: Read my comment/reply below that shares with you how cool it is to use Alexa with Ooma to be your secretary, handling your phone chores."}

You do not need to be connected to your home network, any internet connection will do you just need to log into/create a my hue account through your app when you're setting things up. Additionally, if you are an Apple user and have an Appletv 3rd generation or higher on your home network then you can also use Siri to control the lights from anywhere without using the hue app. Without the Appletv you need to be home to use Siri to control the lights, but it works great, just use words she understands easily to name your scenes.\nNINJA BONUS: Leave an old iphone/ipad/ipod constantly plugged in somewhere convienient, enable \"hey siri\" in the settings and now all your lights are voice controlled.\nThe Hue is the best smart bulb system out there right now. Stay away from the colored bulbs, which you don't really need, and it's very affordable too. Just 5 years ago we spent $10k on a huge hard wired lighting control system for a large restaurant which was a bear to program.

After using it for 2 weeks I added an additional 6 bulbs to my set up. These lights provided a very simple solution to something in my house - for security I wanted timed lighting but didn't have many lamps which could be connected to inexpensive outlet timers. To pay an electrician to swap out a light switch for a timed light switch was fairly expensive when you include the hardware and the labor.\n\nWith this kit, I was able to set it up in 10 mins. I connected the hub to an Ethernet cable on my modem, downloaded the Hue app from the App Store, and swapped out my lightbulbs. Within ten minutes I was able to turn lights on or off from anywhere around the world. Pretty cool and easy. With the app you can set timers to turn lights on and off on any schedule. You can program a single lightbulb if you wanted to. You can even control the brightness of the lighting and dim your lights if you wanted. For my set up, being able to program the lights to turn on and off and control the brightness should save us some money in the long run on electrical bills. Overall I'm very happy with the Hue system and look forward to adding more bulbs to the set up over time."}

It's one thing to have a closed ecosystem from the start, its another to pull the rug out from underneath your current and once loyal users. I'm dumping hue."}

It was a bit confusing with the setup especially when it asks for a code to scan. The code is on the box. I thought it was asking for the serial number to add new devices like the Hue bulbs. After I figured it out, it was nice that the app allowed you to transfer your bulbs from the old bridge to the new bridge. You need to follow the directions pretty closely and carefully but it worked really nice. The hue lux bulbs are great and bright. All in all pretty decent. A bit pricey for what you're getting which is why the 4 stars rather than 5."}

First off, a comparison. I used Belkin's WeMo light switches for 2 years before getting the Philips Hue. The WeMo products are an abomination and I would avoid at all cost. When I first got the WeMo, their Android app was garbage - it was able to communicate with the light switches maybe 50% of the time. TWO years later, I still can't get the remote-access feature to work on the WeMo. With the Philips HUE, I was astonished because the remote feature just WORKS (even my little sister who is terrible with tech would've figured it out) - recall I had the WeMo for 2 years and have never been able to get that to work. With the HUE, if it gets dark earlier than usual because there's a bad storm, I'm able to remotely turn on the lights for my dog while I'm still at work so he doesn't sit in the dark. Another advantage of the HUE system is that it doesn't kill your Wi-Fi router when you add additional lights because with the HUE, only the HUE-Bridge talks to the router. So if you grow your system to 30 Hue bulbs for instance, you still only have the 1 Hue-Bridge talking to the router as the Bridge does all of the leg work with the bulbs. With the WeMo \"system\", every single switch is talking to the router - imagine 30 WeMo switches linked to your router; on top of your PC, smartphone, Chromecast, etc. If you have to change your router's Wi-Fi password, set aside 8 hours to change all of the passwords in each of the 30 WeMo switches. When I think of it, maybe that's why my router kept on crashing when I had the WeMo switches - I'd be watching Netflix and my expensive $160 Linksys router would just crash....maybe because it couldn't handle all of the devices communicating with it. Another PLUS with the HUE is you can adjust the brightness of the bulbs to control the tone/mood of your environment. With the WeMo, your light is simply on or off. Currently, I only have white bulbs hooked to the Hue system. I seriously can't wait to try out the colored bulbs to further adjust the tones/mood of my rooms. The $80 price may seem steep for the initial start-kit, but the additional white bulbs (that lasts ~25000 hours each) is inexpensive at $15 a piece. If you factor in that this system could deter would-be break-in thieves (because there's a random on/off function in the app), then that $80 price tag will pay off for itself 100x over. I'm thinking of getting this for my mom as a Christmas present - I can see her really enjoying this system because she is older and hates having to get up to turn on/off the lights throughout the house."}

At least that's what seemed to make it see the bulbs. Prior to finding that tip on Google (!), Alexa kept apologizing that she couldn't find any connected home devices.\n\nWorks with IFTTT if you create a My Hue account. Can also control the lights through a Web browser from work or the app on the road. No idea how secure it is, but it is just lights.\n\nWas easy to set up. The bulbs come pre-paired to the bridge. Responsive. Hasn't come unglued yet. Figure at some point something will get unpaired, refuse to work without disconnecting and re-pairing, etc. That's the nature of these things. Have heard the light strips aren't recognized by Alexa at this time.\n\nNo buzzing from the bulb with the non-dimming lamps used.\n\nAdded color bulbs easily as well. Added the dimmer switch a little less easily.\n\nNot recommended for whole house automation or primary lighting. Useful for lamps, accent lighting, etc. Limited usefulness without the Echo and/or dimmer remotes.\n\nCould do most of this (minus the colors) since the 70's using X10, which gives you the option of thousands of different remotes, many under $10, where this works with one very limited $25 remote at this time. An IR -> X10 bridge runs about $30.\n\nBonus for developers: there's an open HTTP API."}

Really just wanted the Hue Bridge and felt this would be a way to try out some of the bulbs too. I needed this for the Phillips Hue LED color strip. Using it with my Wink Hub. So far so good. I like I can turn lights off from work after the family is gone to school etc (without turning off the lights)... Next I'm trying to program the lights just to go on and off when we need them the most!!!"}
