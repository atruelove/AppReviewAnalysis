I felt that I needed to acquaint myself with the device before submitting an accurate review but the problems are worrisome and I doubt that they will be addressed until, hopefully the generation model #3 is available. I have had the device for a month now.\nThe first problem I have is that the device demands a very accurate speech pattern before you can get what you are seeking. An example: I tried three different methods to get an audiobook I had been listening to just the night before.\nI have to raise my voice substantially before the device will respond.\nIt doesn't always listen to what you are saying before it goes off on another selection that you don't want. This happens regularly with music.\nIt goes off-line if there is break in the electrical connection, no battery backup.\nA battery back-up would be nice when you want to listen to music and don't have an outlet handy. I like to listen when I am soaking in the tub. The speakers are weak on the dots so it's not always pleasurable.\nThe positive aspects of the device are the ease of handling. I like to keep my shopping list up to date. I don't forget things anymore because the device keeps track for me. This is invaluable to me.\nIf and when I can get it to read my audiobooks, it's a pleasure.\nI like listening to the news and getting exactly what I want to listen to without wading through everything else.\nThe sleep sounds are very nice.\nThe support techs are great and always there when I have a problem. They are always patient and supportive and I am always satisfied with their service.\nIn spite of the problems, the dot has me spoiled and I would not go back to being without it."}

I don't like the selectiveness since it is everything amazon. I can only play music from my amazon music and spotify accounts. Even more, this echo dot HAS to be plugged in to work, which is a waste of time and energy. I have to unplug it when I'm leaving from home, and then it takes a minute or so to load when replugged. Also, it's not a speaker per say, therefore I have to connect to another speaker if I want volume and bass when playing music. It's cool for setting and sticking to any agenda while being hands free. But my phone is in my hand all the time so it hasn't added much to my daily routine."}

We have used it outside for great sounding music. The only disadvantage with the Tap is that it is not hands free. You have to push a button to activate it. The Echo Dot is hands free and I love that, but the speaker is not that powerful to hear music like the Tap. That's why we have both devices. The Echo Dot is a hands free wonderful effortless source of on the \"dot\" source of information. I would highly recommend both of these devices for a full range of uses."}

{"Author": "Liv", "Date": "on August 30, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Good- When she hears me!", "Text": "I've had this thing for about 6 months now and she doesn't listen. I haven't bothered leaving a review because it hasn't made me this mad until this morning. Usually, I don't have to repeat myself more than 10 times, and if it does take me that many times, I give up because whatever I want isn't that important. Well, I've started using her for my alarm in the mornings. I should have known better. Like I said, I usually don't have to repeat myself more than 10x. This morning at 6 AM, I was not a happy camper. I was repeating \"Alexa Stop,\" increasing my volume until actually shouting, then lowering my voice to see if that would make her listen, then raising it again out of frustration and just to see if she's FREAKING DEAF rinse repeat for a solid 5 minutes until I remembered there are buttons on the top of the device, and I scrambled over and pressed them all and she finally stopped.\nRemember this is 6 AM. If I had been more awake, I would have unplugged it or pressed the button sooner instead of shouting forever.\nAlso, she is not too far away from me or obstructed in any way. She is only about 6 feet away from me and there is nothing above or in front of her at all. There is a picture frame behind her, but that's it.\nWhen she works, she works fine. I have tolerated it up to this point because I don't really use it and I don't care that much. It was a gift, which is the only reason I use it, but this morning I was so angry, I would have broken it if it wouldn't have taken so much energy. I hate it. This gadget is not worth it.\nIt's got rave reviews from thousands of other people, though, so maybe I've got a lemon or it is worth it to other people.\nWhatever. I hate it."}

After playing around with it for about a week, I went back and purchased two more. I love these things. They\u2019re like having a personal assistant, music DJ, game show host, storyteller, personal shopper, etc. etc. etc. all rolled into one. I primarily use these to play music from my Amazon Prime Unlimited and various other accounts. But it also gets used to remind me about appointments, as a timer for food that I am cooking and as a means to make my grocery shopping list. I also use it for weather reports; commute times, to send messages to family and friends, to order things off of Amazon, to wake me up in the morning and just as a source for general trivia. It changes the channels for my DirecTV, it gives me a news briefing every morning while I'm getting ready for work and it even knows jokes (not very good ones but it tries). I\u2019m going to start purchasing the smart home devices (light switches, wall plugs and a thermostat) and see how they work with Alexa soon. I love that once I have those installed I can simply walk into my bedroom and say, \u201cAlexa, goodnight\u201d and my lights around the house will all turn off, the front and back doors will lock, the ceiling fan above my bed will come on, and my music will begin to play over the blue tooth speakers at a soft volume thus allowing me to drift off to sleep. Then when it\u2019s time to get up, Alexa lets me know by blasting Reveille from my speakers, starts my coffee maker, turns on the bedroom light, turns off the ceiling fan and gives me my morning news briefing. I ask about my schedule for the day and what my commute into work looks like and she lets me know both what I have scheduled and whether I should take an alternate route into work due to traffic concerns.\n\nThe ONLY negative I have found thus far is that as I walk around the house and notice that I need to add multiple items to my shopping list, I must individually give separate commands to each and every item to be added to list\u2026 i.e. if I need paper towels, bacon and toothpaste I must say, \u201cAlexa add paper towels to the shopping list.\u201d \u201cAlexa add bacon to the shopping list.\u201d \u201cAlexa add toothpaste to the shopping list.\u201d Instead of just saying, \u201cAlexa add paper towels and bacon and toothpaste to the shopping list.\u201d Anyway, it\u2019s minor and certainly not a deal breaker. Perhaps as they continually update the software this will be one of the things that they improve upon."}

They are the most useless electronic devices in my house and that includes any that are broken. I can ask it simple questions such as when did Andre Agassi play his last tennis game and the answer that I get out of 99% of what I ask is \"hmmm I don't know that\". If I have to keep ability of looking it up online then this stupid Amazon thing should be doing the exact same thing. I asked today to multiply $2.59 by 3 and it was unable to do it. (\"hmmm I don't know that\" is all i get) This device is so frustrating. It might be useful if you've got a \"smart house\" with all your devices and lights wired into your network but just as a general use to do other things it's useless. I can set a timer with my watch or my phone or even an old fashioned twist timer I don't need this electronic device to do it for me. I used to be able to set a reminder that would go every 30 days to remind me to change my air conditioning filter. They have done some sort of update and now I cannot do that reminder I can only do a reminder on weekdays weekends go figure or weekly I cannot tell it to remind me every 30 days or every 90 days or every two weeks or three weeks. With each and every update they do the device is more and more useless if that's even possible. Oh it will tell me what the weather is......big deal. I can look it up online myself."}

I am not tech illiterate but am not super savvy either. I found the dots easy to set up and use. I learned very quickly not to put an echo dot two close to the Echo because everyone talks at once. It was really interesting when I asked my kindle to bring up my books, the dot said I should check out prime books and the Echo started reading the book I was part way through. If it wasn't so funny it probably would have been irritating. The dots have been separated from both each other and the main Echo and work great. It is definitely nice to have Alexa around the house, although I don't have a smart house, for updates, music and someone who actually answers me. The only limitation I have found thus far is the dots, even with external speakers attached, don't increase volume very much. The dot twins were easy to manage so I'm sure it won't be long until we increase the size of the Echo family once again."}

The first Dot refused to get past trying to connect to my wireless. The Dot would announce that it was connected and to finish the setup in the Alexa app, but then the Alexa app would never get off the screen trying to connect to Dot/wireless. I finally changed phones and voila it worked the first time. Seems the Pixel on Android 9 couldn't cooperate with the Dot. I changed to my Moto G5 Plus with Android 7 and it just worked. The key seemed to be the Moto/Android 7 would immediately say to manually connect the wifi to the Dot. The Pixel/Android 9 would never suggest connecting manually and even when I did it manually it would connect to the Dot and then nothing would happen and then sometimes it would jump back to the normal wifi network. With the Moto/Android 7 it just worked and then I quickly set up the other two dots.\n\nI also have three wireless access points (APs) and if the Dot's/Echo's are not all on the same AP then there is a good chance they will not all play on the \"everywhere\" group. Since Amazon won't let me forget a network that an Echo/Dot discovered, I had to rename two of my APs with names that the Echo/Dot didn't know. This way they always connect to the one AP and I no longer get a random collection of Dots/Echos playing around the house ... along with an annoyed wife."}

My whole family loved it at first but it seems that after every update it gets significantly worse. She no longer learns from my requests. We have a lamp set up with a Wemo plugin that allows us to control the lamp functions with the echo. I have the lamp named \"lamp\" on both the echo and the wemo app. When I tell Alexa to turn lamp on, 75% of the time she hears me saying the word light instead of lamp. I get that the first letter is the same and there are the same amount of syllables but it's so different sounding. Then when the room is absolutely quiet, I will request Alexa to do something and she doesn't hear me. I can be within a single foot and she still won't hear me. If there was background noise, I would understand, but there isn't. There are other times when I will ask Alexa to set an alarm or to start a timer and she will but it will mysteriously cancel somewhere in the middle, which is highly inconvenient. Needless to say, I won't be buying any additional echos. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the 3 I already own."}

Her basic weather reports are decent and accurate as long as you put in your address. Her question answering skills are basic at best but I'm sure she will grow as Amazon continues to grow her AI database.

{"Author": "Christian M. Mericle", "Date": "on August 26, 2018", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Long on promises, short on delivery", "Text": "As one who purchased Amazon Echo / Alexa as soon as it was available to the general public, I had high hopes. Knowing that it was a new use of existing technology, I was patient with Amazon as it worked to iron out the wrinkles on the way to fulfilling its promise that this cloud-connected device would constantly be improving. I even bought Echo Dots and Echo Dots (2nd Generation). However, Amazon chose to focus more on adding advanced features than on perfecting the basic features. So, Echo can do many things poorly and nothing well. It fails to understand basic commands and often even stops listening halfway through input. It plays songs fine when it's able to find them but even that is hit and miss if two bands have similar names or if Alexa has no idea how the band names are pronounced (for instance, it used to call Sugarland \"Sir Garland.\") Asking it to provide basic facts is, generally, a fool's errand and there are other issues as well. To reiterate, the Amazon Echo does many things but does nothing well."}

The grandkids get a kick out of asking Alexa what time it is or what day of the week it is, and she tells great knock-knock jokes. Then there's the Drop-In function, which we used like a baby monitor when Mom was sick, and it's much better than yelling upstairs when dinner is ready.

{"Author": "Robert Casey", "Date": "on August 24, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "It works... somewhat.", "Text": "I really like that I can control my smart home gadgets by voice. Cool. I realize we are still beta testing because Alexa is in the rough, but with plenty of potiential. If you have a really clear, loud, and robotic voice then you\u2019re good. But if you\u2019re in the southeast (me) and have the slightest southern dialect, (me) getting Alexa to turn the living room light off (example) can become a real challenge requiring multiple attempts and time wasted. Smart home technology should ease effort. Alexa isn\u2019t quite there yet. I\u2019m sure I could do several things to improve my Alexa experience, like re-word my preset commands to something Alexa couldn\u2019t mistake. For example I could change the voice command from \u201cAlexa, turn the lights down\u201d to \u201cAlexa, purple banana\u201d and the voice recognition would be able to differentiate the command better from similar commands that sound alike. This is really my only complaint. More of a constructive criticism than a complaint really because I really like the product. Price is great, product is cool and good quality with a nice fit and finish. But need to improve voice recognition. Since Alexa is so popular, we often hear advertisements via tv or radio that will \u201cwake\u201d Alexa and the software will respond randomly. (Funny at first, annoying several hundred times later) It should learn my voice, and other household users to better understand who is giving commands. And FYI, I might be a southerner, but love that West coast vibe! But I still want to control my Alexa, even in the southeast! Haha :) We will be there soon, just not there yet."}

I then contacted Amazon tech support, allowed them to access my devices and watched them go through all the steps I went through with the same result.

It's turned out to be one of the best purchases i have made. Out of the box it works great but once you start customizing it you can really make it do what you want it to do. From turning your TV on or off, to changing the lights in my room, to telling me down to the minute when it's going to rain. Also comes in handy when you have family over because it does have games that the whole family can play. Very good purchase if your just getting into the smart assistant game."}

Or YouTube or whatever and tell it to search things via my voice. Hopeful with time the skills will be more hands off and more fluent."}

Though it turned out it can recognize only simple sentences, it does far better job than my expectation and good enough to make our life happier.\nFor example, I often forget the full title of songs I want to listen to. Alexa responds to my instruction of \"Play Hey Hey Paula\" with \"Starting Hey Paula,\" and \"Play Wings by Jimi Hendrix\" with \"Starting Little Wings by Jimi Hendrix,\" for example.\nThis is great! My family members instantly fell in love with the Echo-Dot.\nWhat did I do? I immediately ordered a full Echo for our nook table.\nThank you, Amazon!\n\nAh, two caveats at setup:\niPhone could bot set up the Echo. My iPhone 7 with the latest OS version was able to connect to the Echo in AP mode over peer-to-peer WiFi, but it could not set up the Echo to connect to out home WiFi. I had to use my laptop with WiFi and it succeeded.\nDespite advertisement, the Echo could not connect to 5GHz networks. I had to use 2.4GHz.\nIf you ever encounter difficulties in setup, try a PC instead of iPhone and 2.4GHz WiFi instead of 5GHz."}

I work online and can't open even that app while the clock is on and I don't want to use my phone to stream as I need to get calls as well, so Echo sounded like I could have a speaker plus other things all in one. Big disappointment as I can't play my lists here. However, I can play my audible books, which could help a little. Another user has shown up in my configuration (JAVIER) and I can't delete that account. I keep changing F to Celcius and miles to Kilometers, as for some strange reason, the system can't save my settings of the metric system. I can't use it also as a speaker for my computer, so it will remain as a speaking clock, alarm, and reminder of specific duties that I can record. False advertising was involved from Spotify, another reason why I won't pay for their subscription. Amazon music seems decent, but I'm not in the mood to create again my music lists. Finally, the fact that it has to be plugged all the time is a major downer. I might end up selling this here at my country."}

There are games available for skills as well, though aside from \"question of the day\" I've not explored them as much as others. You can set a routine, which will automatically play at a designated time. If you have multiple devices, then you can \"drop in\" or \"broadcast\" on the other devices, which can be used to talk to people in different room are make announcements such as \"dinner's ready.\" Alexa does have a hard time understanding some commands, but I figure as long as I frequently send feedback then it will continue to be improved. Great also for setting reminders and timers."}

I bought a Bluetooth speaker for her room and now she listens to whale sounds to relax and sleep. I used to put my phone face down for relaxing sounds and now the screen temptation is gone as well as the screen light. We are also working on time management and asking Alexa what time it is gets better results than the wall clock, phone, timer, etc as we prepare for back to school morning routines. I love that she loves it! No more worries about what images she could find searching for music and no more frustrations for a small typo because this gadget just gets it right the first time!\n\nAnd as for me, after disappointing collections on Pandora etc, I can say when I ask her to play \u201c90s grunge\u201d, \u201c60s Mototown\u201d, etc... the collections are spot on in whatever artists or bands define that genre. My neighbor and I gave this device a grueling test from the 1920s to today with every category imaginable and all were spot on! I love the timer when I\u2019m cooking because i can keep going without interruption from the stove.\n\nThis week we are going to try the wake up alarms to my daughter\u2019s choice of music and I already know it\u2019s gonna be another success.

Called Amazon support and was informed that the device was purchased in April 2018 and thus was more than 90 days old. Warranty does not cover devices that are older than 90 days according to Amazon tech representative. The best they would do is 15% off purchase of a new one.\nThis seems rather poor to me. We are loyal Amazon customers and this device lasted only four months. Proper resolution would have been to just send us a new dot and have a happy customer."}

In both cases, I was disappointed. Providing voice control of her TV required purchasing an IR hub (Harmony). Configuring the hub to work with Alexa was extremely complicated and ultimately too cumbersome to be used by a non-geek. The hands-free phone calling worked to some degree but the sound quality on both ends was so poor that it would be unusable for someone with hearing issues.\n\nFinally, I discovered that when you enable the Calling and Messaging feature for Alexa, ALL of the contacts on the phone used for setup are slurped up into the Alexa cloud. Once there, there's no way to delete, edit, or otherwise modify the stored contact. Simply slurping up all of the contacts on the phone associated with the Alexa account is 1) an invasion of privacy 2) makes it impossible to correct or change information. The only what you can get rid of the stored contacts is to call Amazon Customer Support and ask them to remove the phone number and contacts associated with your Alexa account. This is a BIG issue. See https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/echo-alexa/467200-delete-imported-contacts\n\nUntil I have control over which contacts Alex stores, I will not be enabling the Communications feature on my Echo Dot. It will remain an amusing but not terribly useful toy. Nor will I suggest purchasing an Alexa device to anyone until this issue is addressed."}

The Dot doesn't get very loud even at its loudest volume setting, and the sound gets noticeably distorted the louder you go. I also have an Echo Plus and vastly prefer it for listening to music.

Right now this review is sitting at a solid 4.5, very close to moving to a 5. So, I will give it a 5 for now.\n\nOverall, I love the Echo Dot. It does voice recognition better than the others and the integration with home automation is great. There is one thing I really really wish Amazon would add, and from what I have read online, many people have been asking for and that is adding the ability to open skills from routines that you create within Alexa. Other than that, I have no real complaints about the Echo Dot. Understanding the built is speaker is not meant to be a high quality music speaker, that is not what it is built for, so I am not going to take stars away for that. If you want a high quality sounding speaker, connect the echo dot to one. Amazon did a nice job in adding the EQ to the latest update, so now you can customize your bass, mid-range and treble to your liking.\n\nI am looking to add more home automation in the near future. I am not sure if it will be via a Echo Plus or adding a Samsung SmartThings Hub.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for something that you can use to play music, from a variety of sources, tell you an interesting fact, a funny joke, play Jeopardy, or entertain your kids for a while, this is exactly what you are looking for. I am happy with the purchase and am looking to add on in the near future."}

Let me start out that I have the highest mbps internet speed I could buy from my cable tv company. There are only two people in this house using it. I thought I could use Alexa to search for programs to watch between Sling, Netflix, and Amazon Prime. I always get an error message. Once in a while it does find a program. By once in a while, I mean once maybe every two weeks. When I speak into the microphone on the Firestick remote, the same thing happens. I get error messages. I could be in the middle of a program and it drops with an error message. Have to back all the way out and go back into Sling, Prime, or Netflix and find my show again. With Smithsonian Earth or Movies anywhere, the picture will freeze, but the commentary continues. I had a 3 year old Roku player prior to this and I never had any of this happen. Everything played fine. Alexa works well for ordering products from amazon, setting alarms, and reminders. It screws up playing songs and doesn\u2019t seem to understand how to play a song as an alarm. I really don\u2019t need it for this, as I have an Apple Watch that does alarms and reminders. In a nutshell, these products do not live up to their expectations. I would leave no star if I could."}

I told the agent I would scrap the system before I paid the 19.95 fee. I hung up on the guy.\nI went to the internet searching to find something on the $19.95 fee and found nothing.

In essence I was told the same thing, my account expired and for $19.95 he would reactivate it with a lifetime subscription. By that time I was foaming mad and was thinking of calling CNN and Fox News to make them aware of the possible scam.\n\nThis time I called the main Amazon customer service explaining they wanted a subscription fee and the lady transferred me to a supervisor in a USA technical support center. I spoke with a young Asian gentleman and he assured me there are no subscription fees for the service. He said the best he could do is make a ticket and send it to the higher up technical people to investigate. While I was on hold with him half the devices became responsive again but half were still down and still down hours later.\nI\u2019ve purchased about 30 additional light switches, dimmers and devices to install on the Alexa system but hesitant because of reliability issues.\nI set all this to text only to advise people there seems to be a scam within the technical support side of Alexa that Amazon big wigs needs to address.\n\nUPDATE\u2026\nI talked to Amazon corporate and they suggested I may have called one of the spoof sites and numbers. They are aware of technical support scams that require payment for service. Amazon has no fees for technical support.\nAll I can say, if you have problems it\u2019s safest to call the main Amazon number and they will transfer you to the appropriate department.\n`"}

Echo is easy to use and Alexa seems to understand most of what I ask even when English is not my primary language. How come Alexa can translate but not speak Spanish?!.\nI bought two echo dot devices and I'm removing a star because to really get something more than background music you will need to pair it with a more powerful speaker but when you ask to play on all devices or \"everywhere\" group it disconnects from any bluethooth speakers you have paired. In other words \"everywhere\" can only be between echo devices (if you want to keep things wirelessly).\nFrom my research, I found that none of the Echo devices are powerful enough to not need an additional speaker so yes, Amazon devices are cheaper and you can buy a few for the price of one Homepod but the sound of the Homepod is superior to several Amazon devices playing at the same time.\nWith that said, regardless of this, I have decided to buy more Echo devices (I'm waiting for my Echo Spots) because I prefer the convenience and coolness of the multiroom smart communication over the big party sound at least for the time being because I'm really hoping that in a near future the play on all devices feature can play on paired bluethooth speakers."}

I enjoy music in the background and have tried several ways to use Bluetooth technology to get it across our various rooms here without success, but with the Dots I can now say \"Alexa, play happy music everywhere\" where that term, 'everywhere' I've defined to include all our Dots (now four, upgraded from my original two purchased on Amazon Prime day for $24.99 each vs. list $49) in the kitchen, bathroom, living room and office areas. Perfect! Plus we can use them as an intercom between rooms, a handy connection when I'm working in my office and need to talk to Pam in the living room. We also find ourselves holding 'conversations' with Alexa, including saying \"Alexa, thank you!\" after she responds to a request, getting her reply with such comments like \"You betcha!\"\nSo many features and uses, we are still exploring after two weeks of fun and handy use."}

Very confusing, very annoying, boxed it all up and screamed \"get out.\" But Alexa was back in the box and said nothing. All I wanted to was to get radio and a speaker. This thing is too complicated for its own good and certainly mine. Good riddance. Sent it back. Cost $9 to return. I'm a Prime member but no UPS store unless drive an hour-plus so had to pay. Never return to Amazon, despite buying a good amount over the years, so that was an interesting lesson. Very finished with Alexa!"}

While he is a \"kid of the 1950's\", he loves technology like this. He is just amazed at some of the things they come up with these days!\n\nSo...I got this on Black Friday, taking advantage of the sale going on. I figured, if Dad didn't like it, I wasn't out too much, and if nothing else, it was a novelty kind of gift.\n\nAfter a little bit of fiddling around, we got the dot connected to the Wifi and starting asking Alexa stupid questions like how old she was, was she single, etc. just goofy stuff. Then someone said \"what's the weather forecast\", and then Dad's eyes lit up when Alexa gave the local weather report. After that it was a flurry of questions like what year did this or that happen, and so forth. Then we played some games, and got Alexa to find some shows on the Amazon Video channels and Dad's fire tablet (the previous year's Christmas gift...yes, I will admit to the \"trend\" here! Guilty!).\n\nSo fast-forward a few months. It's summertime now. The excitement of last Christmas is well past, and life back to a steady roar. Dad is still enjoying the company of Alexa. I stopped by the house one day this past spring, and I was met with the sounds of Johnny Cash blaring from Alexa's little speaker. No, it's not the hi-fidelity stereo sound that was coming from the dot, but more like something that would have been probably considered a higher end speaker back in the 1950's, but you know, that isn't a bad thing. Sometimes it's just perfect, at least dad thinks so, and that's what matters most.\n\nin the end, I'd gladly drop another $25 or $30 I paid for all over again (I can't remember, and it really doesn't matter right now) for the fun and entertainment this little dot has provided. Thanks Jeff."}

After several calls from my internet service, they determined none of my problems were internet related. In the meantime I talked with my technical department at my job. Also someone with a Dot from my internet company called and tried to help set it up. It was obviously a faulty device. Never once did Amazon say there might be something wrong with the Dot. Instead they talked down to me like I'm illiterate. Now they want to know why I have returned something. Well, I guess that would be because I did not want to keep junk.

I should have waited to see how I like this thing... turns out, it ignores me. I thought I could use it as an alarm clock but the alarm won't shut off no matter what I say, so can't be used as an alarm clock. I thought it would work with my so called Alexa approved thermostat... nope. It usually says that the thermostat is not connected. However, the thermostat app on my phone works fine. As far as a simple toy, it is limited as well and gets boring fast. Today, I asked it to play a radio station I frequently listen to via the Echo... it said it could not find the station. I opened the Alexa web page and there it was, my station. I am listening to the station it said it couldn't find, but I had to launch it from the web site, not the device. It just seems to be more frustrating and trouble than it is worth. It is too late to get a refund, so I think I am going to give all three away or throw them away. No one likes to be ignored by someone, but when an inanimate object ignores you. that's it, it gone. Since I have three and they all seem to work poorly, I doubt it is anything I am doing wrong, it's just not a good product. Would not recommend.\n\nUPDATE: Well, I've had enough. The unit that was playing my music station after I had to use the web page to get it to play... It frikkin ignored me again when I wanted it to stop. I had to pick it up, place it about 1 inch away from my mouth and yell at it to stop. My speakers are across the room, about 15 feet away and not loud, so I know there wasn't interference. The little ring lit up like it is suppose to and still ignored me. Very proud of my 90+ mph pitch into the waste basket across the room! I am glad I didn't miss the waste basket or that would have been another thing to get angry about. I think I will use the other two Dots I have as archery target practice. At least I will get some form of enjoyment out of them that way."}

I occasionally asked for the weather when needed, which wasn't very often since I had a phone. But the day I decided to request Alexa to play some music. Alexa does not respond. I just get the rings flashing at me. So then I rebooted. I disconnected it from the charger.. I did practically everything. Nothing helped. I then contacted customer service which told me to do every single step I already did with it, which was annoying but maybe it would work this time. Nope. Does not work whatsoever. I was then advised to pay for a new one to replace it because I don't have warranty anymore. I was told that the device could be faulty at any time. Well what a rip off. I'm happy it wasn't $100. Why would I replace something I hardly used to begin with because it decided to die out? What if it happens again? I love Amazon. But how very disappointing this product is."}

If you shop all the time on Amazon, you can ask Alexa where your order is, and she'll tell you and even show you pictures of your orders on the Show. But her search engine is CRAP. We like asking questions. And poor Alexa seems like a third grader compared to \"Professor\" Google Home when it comes to answering questions. PLEASE improve information search! If you can do that Amazon, Google Home won't be needed. As it is, I have to CONSTANTLY pick up my phone to ask questions after Alexa has failed. And they're EPIC fails, in which it almost seems a joke that she gave you the answer that she did. I really like our Alexa devices--especially the Show.

Easy set-up and connection to wifi, voice recognition is fine for a 20ft radius (even for a 6yo), speaker is good enough for a bedroom, and the skills/apps are gettng better and more expansive by the day. Highly recommend looking into the Amazon music packages as they certainly add to the value of echo devices; you can get by on Prime and you can kinda use your own music library, but the music subscriptions are worth it for me (you do have access to the music streaming anywhere via app). Anyway, I've tried a competitor's Mini-ature device, and like the Echo because (1) saying \"Alexa\" is nicer than saying \"Hey Goo...\", (2) the light ring is a better acknowledge-signal because it's easily seen from the side as well as from the top of the device, and (3) I like the physical buttons because it's better for the kids.\n\nGreat Prime day deal!"}

The one thing I will say is siri on my iPhone x works my smart devices much quicker and easier. Setup on the echo is easier as far as connecting to wifi, but connecting to smart devices is easier using home kit. Been dying to try these though and do an alexa siri comparison myself for quite sometime now, so Im still happy with the purchase. If your looking to listen to music on these, upgrade, cause the sound quality isn't very good if thats what you want to use them for and I HIGHLY recommend buying a wall mount for them.

And then another for my husband's grandfather. He has fallen a couple of times at night (due to low blood sugar) and can use this to call us without having to get up or get to a phone."}

For the most part, it does everything that you expect it to do and it works great. The reason I don't give it five stars is because the speaker itself on the device isn't very good. However, we have it always linked via bluetooth to a Bose Soundlink so we get really great sound from it all the time. But, if you wanted to use it to listen to a lot of music (which was our main purpose) and you were just using the dot itself, you might be disappointed with the sound quality. But when this is paired with Amazon Music Unlimited, you have almost any music in the entire world at your voice command fingertips."}

I also tell it to set watering timers reminders for when to go move the sprinkler hose. I was concerned that a second unit might interfere with the Echo Dot in the house, but it hasn't presented any such issues yet. I am researching Alexa to find what options there are to play TV stations through it. I wish I had one in the shower that could stay charged.

I will keep this for a smaller room where I want Alexa access but don't need quality sound, but will also be getting more of the full speaker models (Echo/Echo Plus). It is so fun to be able to play music anywhere in the house (not to mention being able to Rick-roll my wife any time she is close to a speaker), and to be able to control the TV and connected appliances/lights.

We use ours for music and weather updates mostly, but it's fun to ask it random questions and I'm sure we'll start looking into other features like thunderstorm sounds and jeopardy and shopping. If you're looking to home automate - this is a good starter (especially given the price...which is even better on prime day or near Black Friday, for those thrifty shoppers)! Sound quality is better on the Echo standard device, but this little thing can kick out some decent sounds. Small and unobtrusive, you can put it just about anywhere and it wont be an obnoxious eye sore - cables can be a bit unsightly though, so try to hide them if you're looking for true aesthetics!"}

{"Author": "Mode Red", "Date": "on July 31, 2018", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "What do you know!? Just Ask Alexa! Alexa, CALL MOM!", "Text": "The best Echo version is the Dot, period. We all have phones we can put Alexa onto alongside other virtual assistants such as Siri and Bixby. But what if THERE ARE NO PHONES, no tablet nor pc in the house? How would you make a call? How would you get vital information from the web? The answer is ask Alexa with your Echo Dot. Why the Dot? Because its small size allows it to remain hidden while being connected by wire or Bluetooth to any external speaker. You can add Alexa to every room in the house with the Echo Dot for a very low price-per-room. When you want to talk to someone, you can just call them, \"Alexa, call mom.\" When they want to talk to you, they can just talk to you, \"Alexa, drop in on MOM.\" or \"Alexa, drop in on Uncle's Room\" using the Drop-In intercom feature. Having semi-hidden Echo Dots in rooms has a TON of possibilities, let alone being able to drop-in from WORK! This feature is worth the price alone. Get the Echo Show if you want to do drop-in video chat in a main area of the house.\n\nEcho's also have skills for Alexa, which add new features to Alexa's repetoire. Such as controlling your Alexa enable smart devices and even telling \"short bedtime stories\". You can truly personalize your Echo Dot to suit the needs of your family. I love to cook. Some cool culinary skills are an Instant Pot app that helps me plan my next pressure-cook and a My Chef app that helps you get only what you need while you're at the grocery store! Workouts, weather, news -you can't lose for the price of an Echo Dot.\n\nCons: My Echo Dot is connected to my living room sound system, but I am trying to rig it so that it is overrided when the TV is on. Then it should default to its own speaker or interrupt the TV audio. Maybe someone else has figured out how to do this. The speaker in the unit is fine for normal conversations, but not for thumping music. Right now I have to manually switch to bluetooth or aux mode to connect Alexa to my surround speakers."}

So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn\u2019t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don\u2019t like that it\u2019s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don\u2019t. Lastly, I\u2019m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven\u2019t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually \u201cAlexa\u201d."}

The native speaker is actually noticeably better than my iPhone 6+ native speaker. However I discovered the radio stations so I have a different view now.]\n\nIt's rather unfortunate that Amazon doesn't do a better job of educating users about how to use the Echo Dot. (This post applies to all similar devices, obviously). I was about to return it, since I viewed it as a rather expensive i-XXX speaker. (No, my house isn't on the web, and it will NEVER will be!).\n\nWhat you might like to do for music/radio is to download the \"iHeart Radio\" app. Then you can say: \"Exho [Alexa] play ___ iHeart radio station.\"\n\nIt's quite awesome to be able to switch from news to classical to jazz when I'm coding - just by voice. Sometimes I have to pick it up and mute the volume in order to yell at it (LOL), but that's better than pointing and clicking. Plus it doesn't slow down my computer or drain my iPhone.\n\nHere are a few of my favorites (pick your own from the iHeartRadio app):\n\n1) NEWS:\nWBAA Jazz [my local station, consult iHeartRadio for yours]\nWBAA Classical [ditto]\nNBC News\n\n2) CLASSICAL:\nClassical KUSC\nClassical Highlights\nClassical WQXR\n[Specific composers:]\nJohann Sebastian Bach\nChopin Station\nLudwig Von Beethovan\nWolfang Amadaus Mozart\n\n3) JAZZ:\nVinyl Jazz\nWBGO Jazz\nSmooth Jazz\n\nI'm sure I'll find more stations as I continue to use it, but you get the idea :)"}

You have to remember the name of every Skill to use them, and they are also limited in abilities. 90% of the time I still have to go to my phone or ipad so it just ends up adding another step. The related app is just as bad (cumbersome and usually freezes when you try to search for items). I basically use it to add items to my grocery list and maybe a weather forecast. It\u2019s got a long way to go before being truly useful.\n\nBiggest pro is that the microphone can detect your voice from a distance even with background noise, so it can be placed anywhere."}

{"Author": "Chiru", "Date": "on July 28, 2018", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Want to connect her to your HTPC without using seperate inputs? Here's how! (And an actual dot review)", "Text": " If you're like me, you've been hesitant on buying one of these. We're not quite there with AI assistants and there's really no need to have one of these with those current AI limitations. But they're fun. And the price was right. You, like me, probably bought this during the prime day sale. $30 seemed sexy and probably worth the money to say dumb things to Alexa to see how she'd react. At least that was my reason for dropping the cash. Don't judge me too harshly. I'm going to split this review into two sections, one based on the title for those trying to connect her to their HTCP receiver without having to split inputs. This means you can use her as an assistant while you watch a movie, play a game on your pc, or work. You don't have to switch your A/V receivers input to access Alexa's sound. Second, I'll comment on the usefulness and fun factor of the dot itself.\n\nI'll start with the Dot:\n\nSo here's the deal. I bought this because it was cheap and because I wanted to say dumb things to her because I'm an immature child with a stupid sense of humour. But there's a problem with that. Alexa is so PC (greatest tech pun ever?) that she simply doesn't register anything \"offensive\" you say to her. She just IGNORES you. She's just NO FUN. I didn't buy you to experience marriage, Alexa. It doesn't have to be dirty. Any language she deems inappropriate, (and there's a lot), even seemingly harmless things, don't fly with her. Juvenile amusements aside, her responses are very dry and robotic. You can tell there's not much passion or energy behind her canned responses. Or more accurately, she's about as personable and hip as a bookish librarian in her 50s. (No offense to librarians) And for that, I take a star. But that's really my only complaint. Knowing the weather, reciting a wiki page, playing audible stories, or telling me the news and setting an alarm; Alexa does as designed in all these things. She's great for the typical assistant-like functions, but she's just not \"fun\" yet.\nSo... the google mini. I have to bring it up. My friend has a google mini. Basically google's version of an echo dot. Unfortunately, google's mini is just way more fun. They have so many hidden easter eggs, fun responses to questions in which alexa would just say \"Sorry, I don't know that.\" (This happens way too often, Amazon). Google lacks the powerhouse of amazons quick ordering system from amazon.com, but honestly that's where the limitations stop. Alexa still won't let you use Youtube. Google can (of course). And most important of all (to me...) I can say dumb things to google and I'll actually get a fun sarcastic response instead of silence. The developers actually have a sense of humour. I like that. Laughter is the best medicine after all. Google just feels more AI-like than Alexa does. Alexa feels like a program, and google feels like an AI. That's honestly the best way I can describe it. I hope this changes. Until then, I'll be keeping one of these stars. This may not be an issue to most people, and if not having a \"friend\" on your desktop, or table, or in your kitchen matters, and instead having hardware seems more appealing, then you'll love this device just fine.\n\nOn to connecting the dot to your HTPC:\n\nWouldn't it be great if the Echo Dot would play through my speakers WITHOUT me having to dedicate a single channel to it? In otherwords, while I still hear all my sound on my PC or TV, such as games or movies, wouldn't it be great having the Echo Dot be able to listen to me and say things on the same input? It would. But Amazon still hasn't caught up to the idea that some of us consider our PC's to be outputs, not only input. I'm going to explain how to do this, because for whatever reason Amazon's software refuses to recognize PC's as speakers, only the dot as a speaker. This is why you need this device. Here's the process, it's simple:\n\nBy default, setting up Bluetooth on the Echo Dot causes the pair to use the dot as the primary speaker. Buy this device to remedy that issue. I'm also assuming you've already paired your echo with the tp link via the alexa mobile app on your smartphone. If not, do this first.\n\nStep 1: Plug in the TP-Link Receiver NOT to your A/V receiver but to the mic input of your PC.\nStep 2: Go into Windows sound settings (The control panel screen)\nStep 3: Go to Recording Devices Tab.\nStep 4: Go to Properties of the Recording device you connected your audio cable from the TP Link to the mic jack by right clicking on it. Probably Realtek, unless you have a sound card like I do. In this example, I connected it to my Sound Blaster card, so I'd go to the properties of the respective mic. For a regular PC without a soundcard, it'd likely be your Realtek mic jack on the back of your pc.\nStep 5: In properties, go to the Listen Tab. Make sure your correct sound device is selected.\nStep 6: Check the \"Listen to this Device\" checkbox.\nDONE! That's it. That's all you need to do to have the Echo Dot work simultaneously in the background while you watch youtube, or play games on your PC, all on the same channel input. Pretty neat huh?\nI've attached a visual aid to this.\n\nNOTE: You sometimes DO need to ask Alexa to either disconnect from the tp link, or reconnect to it depending on whether your motherboard turns on or off during a full shutdown. In my case, before bed or if I turn my PC off (since my motherboard also shuts down) I say \"Alex, disconnect from TP Link\" and she'll start playing sound from my Echo Dot instead. Then if I turn my PC back on, I say \"Alexa, connect to TP Link\" and voila, back in business.\n\nHope this helps, I had a bit of an annoying journey trying to get this to work, so my pain will hopefully translate to your ease of mind. Hope you guys found this helpful!\n\nAs for the device itself? So far so good. Audio quality isn't perfect, but that's a bluetooth limitation, not a device limitation.\nProtip: Adjust the mic volume levels to coutner any distortion you hear, also turn off ANY and ALL mic effects you might have on, or alexa will sounds like she's downing underwater. Don't torture Alexa."}

But I had one strong complaint about it when utilizing the bluetooth connection to our home audio system there is a lot of lag in Alexa's response. For example if you ask her how much time is left on a timer and there is say 35 minutes left you start hearing the response at 5 minutes. Missing the thirty completely. As that was the reason for purchasing it to use with the Bluetooth it's a little bit disappointing so we end up using our other Echo in the kitchen for timers. Experience wise it is pretty consistent with our other echos and it's excellent in telling which one you're speaking to. For example if you are standing between the kitchen and the living room depending on which way you are slightly facing it picks up the correct room reliably."}

{"Author": "SnugglesTheHusky", "Date": "on July 28, 2018", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Affordable and a good introductory smart speaker device. Just needs to support Google more.", "Text": "I finally decided to get a pair of these on Prime Day. I was waiting until the smart plugs came down in price before buying them. I initially had lots of problems when I first installed them. But from trial and error and lots of experimentation, I got them running more reliably by setting them up manually rather than having their built-in DHCP clients. Initially, these echos and the smart plugs would randomly disconnect from my router leading to two frustrating days of getting these hockey puck computers to switch on the lights. Often, they would get confused and respond back they would see multiple devices of the same name on my local network.\n\nWithout going into all of the steps I did to troubleshoot them, I'll provide the solution that seemed to work for me and perhaps it may help you too if you had problems of random wifi disconnects of both the echo devices and the smart plug devices.\n\nUsing the Address Reservation and AP Isolation features in my router, and most modern routers have these features with the exception of the really cheap-o-routers. I connected all of the smart devices on my guess 2.4Ghz band. I assigned them static ip addresses using Address Reservation and I did the same with all of the smart plugs. Guess Wifi on most routers run on a separate VLANs. Using AP Isolation and AR isolates them in their own private wifi LAN and gives me a bit of piece of mind that they don't have access to data on my main LAN. Also, when they lose WIFI connections and regain it, they are assigned the same IP numbers. Initially, these smart speakers would get confused when WIFI devices were on and off again. The Echo saw them as duplicate devices with different IP numbers. Setting up static IPs eliminated that problem.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have with Alexa is that they don't work well with Android TV OS devices. They work fine with Amazon's own FireTV devices, but not well with Android TV OS eg Nvidia Shield TV. A workaround has been using my Logitech Harmony which is Alexa and Google Assistant aware. But programming them reliably hasn't worked very well.\n\nThe Alexa devices don't necessarily work as advertised when a room has other noises from televisions, fans and air conditioning units. The Alexa seems to have a lot of difficulties hearing me when a fan or the A/C hum is in progress. Their success rate drops to 20% understanding me, and about 50-60 with the television on. I'm a native English speaker so my voice isn't the problem. Perhaps Alexa's success rate might improve with time.\n\nOf course, the other problem is that Alexa doesn't have access to my Google Gmail or other Google features. My cyberlife is pretty much on Google's servers so this annoying cold war between Amazon and Google is getting annoying.\n\nMy deciding factor to go with the Echo Dots instead of the Google Mini was the AUX and Bluetooth pairing features. If it weren't for these two features not present on the Echo Dot, I would have purchased a Google Mini. But one of the features I really wanted to do is listen to music on my home's surround sound speaker system without the television switched on. To the Echo Dot's credit, it connected very well with my home sound system so I can enjoy the music the echo streams in with the higher quality sound of a dedicated home theater surround sound system. The Google mini required I buy an audio chromecast for an additional cost. No Bluetooth or Aux on the Mini. As of right now, as I type this, I am listening to Classic rock and 1980s tunes streamed through the Echo to my surround sound with wonderful rich deep bass.\n\nThe echo has a lot of nice additional features I like too. I use the alarm clock feature to wake me up in the morning without the glaring LED display of a traditional alarm clock radio. The Echo dot isn't very noticeable which I like too. In fact, my friends didn't know I had them until they see the colorful led right light lite up.\n\nThese smart speakers are still in embryotic development so I don't expect to make a huge impact in my life yet which is why I have been reluctant into spending a lot of money for Amazon's more expensive Alexa options. However, the Amazon Echo Dot is a good introductory smart speaker, especially when they are on sale. When you pair them with good HiFi equipment via Bluetooth or Aux, you can get superior sound from them than the more expensive Alexa devices anyway.\n\nATTENTION AMAZON: Please allow the user to choose their own key wake up word. If Garmin's GPS devices allow me to come up with my own wakeup word, I'm sure Alexa should too, considering the massive supercomputing infrastructure behind Alexa. Three options aren't enough. Add Google connecting skills so I can check my emails and text messages from Google Voice."}

Every time I asked a question, we got the response \u201chmm I don\u2019t know the answer to that one\u201d. Including the weather. How is it that every other smart device has this capability but the echo dot does not? Also - it has to be plugged in.

Also if you group your echos to play in a group you can\u2019t put the same echo in two different groups. For example I have 1 in my master upstairs 1 in the dining room 1 in the kitchen and 1 downstairs in the living room. I had the dining room, kitchen and master in 1 group called upstairs. I wanted to make a 2nd group in case we had company over for a Christmas party or something that had the dining room kitchen and downstairs living room. I couldn\u2019t however because the kitchen and dining room were already in the group called upstairs. Like I said minor issues but still things I wish the echo was capable of doing."}

This is annoying and inconvenient as heck. Last night it seemingly dropped the Pandora station I was listening to, but when I asked Alexa if she was still on, she said yes. The volume had turned down to almost nothing in its own, and I couldn't hear it anymore. When I gave it a couple more commands, it seemed to get frustrated and just stopped working.

I love how small it is, which means I can have it anywhere in my home, but I really also loved how I was able to take it on vacation and use it with my friends and family who had never seen it before. It really blew their minds. I would give it 5 stars, but what's preventing me from doing this is the fact that Alexa is sensitive to background noise that's coming from my television, and in order for me to ask her to turn off the lights, I have to first mute the television so she can hear that Im asking her to do this for me.\n\nShe has lots of great activities, and I really love how I can play music throughout my house with that really cool skill I learned from the App.\nAmazon has really done a nice job of bringing this technology along and making it very user friendly. I can't wait to purchase other Amazon products like the Echo Show and see what kind of cool stuff it can do to make my life easier and more organized.\n\nThis is truly one of the coolest inventions I have ever seen in my life and makes me super excited to live in a time where you can have an assistant like this, great job Jeff Bezos, you are an awesome entrepreneur and I have loved what Amazon represents for many years. This product continues to show me why I love Amazon as much as I do and I can't wait to see what comes next, bravo sir!"}

I have a Sonos speaker, a Nest air conditioning control system and some other devices I want to purchase to make my home as smart as possible.\nI am still a relative novice in using the device but would make the following observations:\n- it is unobtrusive and while the design is fairly plain it is easy to place it almost anywhere and it will pick up your voice commands.\n- the response time is very quick and it does not seem to require much training to understand what I am asking\n- the cost can't be beat\n- Amazon is continually adding new features\n- Put simply - it is fun to use."}

News briefings seem interesting but its just generally faster to look at your phone due to most of the news skills give you headlines anyway. Outside of temp and the limited smart home control launched at this point we just use the joke things you can ask Alexa when someone sees a list.

{"Author": "Guest", "Date": "on July 26, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Drop-in Functionality needs a lot of work imo", "Text": "I mainly bought this product for the Drop-in feature. We were using an old multi handset phone system for our intercom needs, but the batteries were not keeping charge and needed replacing. I initially was looking at buying a new phone system (don't have a home phone line), until I found out about the drop-in feature with the Echo Dot's. I have a large home and purchased 6 of them for the house. We placed them in the kids rooms, the kitchen, the loft, and the 2 bedrooms we use for home office space. The \"announce\" feature works perfectly, as my wife will announce when dinner is ready so all devices will sound and everyone can hear the same announcement. With the drop-in feature, the Echo Dot's don't seem to want to drop in on the right device. I have changed the device names several times to try to get them to work consistently, but they don't. Once you are able to connect when you drop-in, it is often really hard to get them to hang up or end the call.\nI like many of the features that this device has. I have outdoor string lights that I connected to an \"idevices\" product, and installed the skill on the Echo Dot's so I can turn them on and off with voice command.\nI used the 3.5mm speaker output to connect to my receiver, so I can play SiriusXM and change channels with voice command\nAlexa doesn't have a lot of answers, but her jokes can be funny at times when you ask her to tell you a joke.\nOverall I really like the product, I just couldn't score it higher than a 3 because of how the drop-in feature is working right now. Also trying to find answers through Amazon support is beyond terrible. I finally found the forum, but people on there are complaining about similar issues since beginning 2017 and they are still happening."}

It's a great bargain when on sale, and even at full price, it helps me enjoy those experiences where I like having music in the background. Set-up is straight forward, but that's after setting up 6 of them. The first one or two were a learning experience for me. The Dot's sound quality leaves a lot to be desired if you're an audiophile, but you're told up front that it will not rival the full-size Echo. In situations where I want quality sound, I buy a pair of small, decent blue-tooth speakers and route the sound through them. If you find the cost of additional speakers to be high when combined with the price of the Dot, then buy the full-size Echo, which has built-in speakers that I find more than adequate for my needs."}

I can control Alexa by my cell phone so turning volume up and down and changing songs can be done anywhere in the house. It is a master volume so I had to turn each rooms volume controller to the desired setting knowing that when i raise the volume with Alexa it raises all of them the same.\nAdded the local radio station App as well as Sirius XM App so any music is available all around the house as long as I have my cell handy.\nGreat product.

The list skill is awesome, on the flip side of that coin, I really was hoping that Alexa could tell me if I had an incoming call on my cell phone. I don't always have my phone on ring so I miss calls, sadly enough, she can only do this for Echo to Echo calls. Her ability to play music from Amazon music is cool, and the news briefings are a plus too!...however on the flip side, she doesn't always understand what I'm saying or hear me and I have to repeat myself. That's not a huge deal, but if you're in a rush, or having \"a day\" it can be a bit frustrating.\nOverall...I love it."}

I have to say, this was so easy to set up and worked so well that I started looking immediately to buy more smart home devices. I only wished I had done so during Prime Days! I won't review the Echo Dot here, but suffice to say that it works great and I'm happy with it. As for the Sengled smart hub and bulbs, they too work great! I ordered a couple more bulbs, but at the higher color temperature (5,000 I think). Everything syncs up with Alexa and works flawlessly. I've also added a couple of TP-Link smart switches as well.\n\nI do want to give kudos to Sengled support. The only issue I had was trying to utilize the IFTTT feature, which allows you to do things such as turn your lights on as you approach your home. It uses your smart phone to determine your location. You can set the activation area as large as you'd like; one block away or a few miles out if you want. Anyway, I could not get IFTTT to \"see\" my Sengled bulbs so I emailed tech support. This was around 7:30 PM central time and I got a reply about an hour later! I certainly wasn't expecting that! I figured I'd have to wait a couple days at least! The tech advisor informed me to try the newer app from the Apple app store. I, apparently, was using the old version. Simple as that, I got IFTTT to recognize my bulbs!\n\nI've only had the Echo and Sengled bulbs for a week now so, I cannot speak to the longevity of these items. If anything arises, I will post an update. So far so good and I've now got an Ecobee4 smart thermostat on order. This stuff can be addicting!"}

When the Dots are on sale on Prime Day and only cost me $25 or so, then why not get one of these?

One employee Sarah who was the most helpful employees that thought It might of been the remote control issue, she tried getting me someone to approve a new one for me but I was told no. After all that time I spent on the phone I was very frustrated with Amazon and customer service for jerking me around so long.

The first one we got was the step up from the Echo. so I decided to get my husband another one for Father's day and use this one for the bathroom when he gets ready in the mornings. He will have it at max volume and it's not loud enough when you want to jam out in the morning. I would just stick with the taller version, it's a little more expensive but the sound quality and volume options are much better. I feel like I have to say Alexa like 3 times or more for the little one to even hear me."}

I have been on tech support for over an hour now trying to add skills to my daughter's dot (age 6) and none of the kids apps appear to be available. We are not paying additional fees for the Free Time Unlimited yet it seems that the only skills the Dot will allow me to add are NPR and Reuters news. I have added skills such as Leapfrog Songs and other clearly kids apps yet cannot allow my daughter to access them as part of the FreeTime program. We are instead going to turn off the internal parental controls, much lauded in the product description, just so my daughter can listen to music at bed time."}

The last one I purchased was for our kids room. We already have a FreeTime Unlimited subscription, so there was no reason to pay extra for the kids edition. I just activated it and set it to the free time filters. My boys have spent hours in their room quietly listening to stories and exploring the skills for kids. The speaker quality isn\u2019t amazing, but definitely good enough to enjoy music or an audio book."}

{"Author": "Twister", "Date": "on July 24, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "The Little Dot that Could", "Text": "What is not to love about this smart home device. It is affordable, flexible, powerful (can be), and simple.\n\nAffordable\nThis has the same functionality as the original Echo in a smaller package. It has access to all the popular music streaming services and plays them with a simple voice command. Answer trivia questions, reading books, weather, traffic....the works. With a simple 3.5 audio jack, this thing can be even more powerful than the original Echo.\n\nPowerful\nThis device is perfect for a bedroom on a nightstand beside the bed. If that isn't good enough for you, or if you plan on placing this in a larger room, just connect the 3.5 audio cable from this device to another sound system to get that rich full sound you are looking for.\n\nFlexible\nAs stated previously, this device can be placed virtually anywhere in the house. You can use it by itself, or pair it with another system for more sound. You can purchase multiple Echo Dots and even create your own full home system by pairing them together with the Groups feature. I persoanlly have an Echo device in 4 rooms in my home. I have a grouping called 'House' which can play music across my entire home on all the devices. I have an Echo Dot hooked up to a Bose system in my Living Room.\n\nSimple\nLike other Echo devices, plug in the device, download the app and setup is a breeze. Once you install your first Echo device, adding others is even faster.\n\nConclusion\nYou really cannot beat the all around functionality of this device. There are frequent sales on the Echo devices as well so make sure to watch when the sales are in place.\n\nThanks for reading!"}
