Samsung SmartThings Smart Home Hub
{"Author": "Collins", "Date": "on September 4, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Unreliable and mobile apps are a mess", "Text": "There are two different mobile apps for the hub. Most of the functionality of the old app doesn't work in the new app. On top of that, the interface is terrible.\n\nLots of issues getting basic pairing working with outlets and other pieces in the box. Delays when turning on lights. You tell it to turn on a light, then you wait.\n\nReturning. Serious disappointed."}

All I had read said that it could turn it on and off. Sadly, it only turns it off and has very limited control of the other functions. To be honest, this probably isn't the fault of the box but of the TV (a 'smart' Samsung). My view may change once I have been able to install some other 'smart' stuff for my home but I will probably look at something like the Amazon Fire stick to control my TV."}

I really wanted this to work. Finally I just returned it and bought a Wink (1) for $29. Connection was easy. Just keep it away from the router and move the hub around if you have issues connecting."}

I loved it, integrated it Alexa, and started adding more smart switches and devices. Worked smoothly and easily... for three months.\n\nThen Samsung pushes an app update, causing it to lose my hub and all the devices attached. I didn't notice until I kept asking Alexa to turn on lights, and her polite response was basically \"I don't know what the hell you're talking about\"....\n\nSo I figure I'll have to re-link the hub and all devices to the app (oddly enough there are now two SmartThings apps on my phone, thanks Samsung...). It will be a pain, and take a lot of time, but what choice do I have? I currently have white brick connected to my network.\n\nSo I start to go through that process, only to find out I need a code that was on small piece of paper. From three months ago. Which I can't find... (I know, I should have taped the code to the hub itself. Or maybe Samsung should put the code directly on the hub instead of small, easily losable piece of paper.)\n\nSo now I have no working hub and no smart home. I can search through papers hoping to find the code, or wait for customer service to finally respond. Or I could call customers service, which is conveniently available during the hours most people are working. Either way, I give this device two stars for the three full months it worked.\n\nUPDATE: The support on Samsung's website will tell you that the welcome code is on the included card, and if you don't have it you need to contact support. I did some searching and found out the welcome code is in some cases also printed in the battery compartment. So I got my hub back online and tried to reconnect all my devices. But now for some reason it will only connect to Samsung brand devices, and despite numerous attempts will not find any of my Leviton or GE switches.\n\nUPDATE2: Still haven't heard back from Samsung Customer Service, but I finally managed to get it working again. I had to go into exclusion mode and manually go to each device and remove it. Once they were removed then the app would find them again when searching. I'll up the review to three stars, because when it's working it's great. Unfortunately the possibility of losing all my devices again worries me.\n\nUPDATE3: It worked again for about a week, then today I got the notifications that my hub wend offline, then came back online. And now all of my devices are disconnected again. I really wanted to like this hub, but I really don't like constantly reconnecting every smart device in my home. The reliability just isn't there..."}

Last week my hub completely removed itself from my app and IDE. I set the alarm off and had no way to turn it off until the batteries ran out. now I have to manually re-add the 20-30 devices and of coarse every zwave device has a different way of connecting ..so this one item you might have to hold a button for 5 seconds and press it again. Another device you need to flip the light switch in some goofy pattern. And of coarse the door sensors that make you do the hokie pokie to get it to pair. This system will fail you.

I couldn\u2019t get my inovelli NZW30 switches to pair and everything else was difficult to pair. There were two issues. My router as unstable and was new to Z-wave and the SmartThings hub. I started with the new version of the iPhone app not realizing it was only a few months old and was a total redo of the app.\n\nIn the end I canned my original setup with the new version of the SmartThings app. The software security won\u2019t let you run a new version and classic version on the same device. The registration is a one-shot deal. You have to do a reset to get the classic app working.\nThe new version is no good right now. It does not support auto pairing for all intents and purposes. this is important because only a fraction of the available devices are listed in the menu.\n\nI messed up the reset some by not de-pairing the devices in the app prior to resetting it. If you have to backout from the SmartThings app realize it\u2019s best to do an online delete of each device then do the hub reset. Also, a local reset can be required. Without going into the details, I managed to de-paired them using the new version that had luckily been installed on another Apple device.\n\nI have to give a shout out to inovelli. I couldn\u2019t get their NZW30 switches to pair even after I reset everything else. When I emailed them, the founder answered back in less than two hours. They gave me some helpful advice and sent me a new NZW30 tested switch within two days which paired like a champ.\n\nThe main take away is, use the Classic App until they get the new version working."}

I could not have been more wrong. Virtually every ZWAVE or LAN device I connected or tried to connect was an abject failure:\n\nGE Wink bulb, a very common ZWAVE product? Unsupported. Not in the list.\n\nAEON home energy monitor? Not in the list.\n\nAEON motion detectors? It managed to add them, but aside from room temp, they didn't work. No motion sensing. I tried to add a scene to turn on a light when they sensed motion? Impossible.\n\nGE ZWAVE wall switches? It added the first one. The one next to it I tried to add like 20 times. It didn't find it, even though it powered the lights so it was definitely on. Many forum users said the same - a nightmare to add.\n\nBryant LAN Thermostat? Also not on the list. No support.\n\nOh and AV support? Let's see, my Onyko NR626? No. Yamaha RX LAN receivers? No. In fact, NO receivers are supported!! Washing machines and ovens- some. Receivers, none. Really, Samsung? How many homes have their ovens on the LAN? Like NONE! Receivers- lots of homes. In fact if you bought a receiver in the past decade its probably on the LAN.\n\nI expected the VERA to be like a hobbyist hub - hard to use, and for tekkies. And I expected the Smartthings with a company worth billions behind it to be rock solid and support common products. I had it exactly backwards. The Samsung is targeted at Samsung products like Fridges and washing machines. Which no one has on his or her LAN.\n\nToday I shut off the Dumbthings , and plugged the Vera back in. I plan to reset the dumb things and sell it for a huge loss. Money well spent on the lesson I learned about corporate ZWAVE projects.\n\nOh and the ap? It has like zero config options. ANd the web interface? It said I had no hub at all (even though the AP said I did, and I signed in with the same ID). DUMB DUMB DUMB. How could the phone ap associate my hub to my email, and the web ap no? This is worse than bad.\n\nThat was like 8 hours I'll never get back. They should package this hub with their Washers and Ovens, and not offer them to consumers with a plethora of non-Samsung ZWAVE devices, like most of us.\n\nI have several TECH masters' degrees, and own/review many tech products. Usually, I rave about how great they are. In this case, I wish I'd never trusted a corporate solution. What a disappointment.\n\nWanna buy a hub?"}

After months of off-and-on play, primarily with Openhab, I was tempted to try SmartThings as it promised a plug-and-play nature and seemed to support everything I wanted with their custom (though very confusing) development environment.\n\nUnfortunately, from the get-go, SmartThings was causing trouble. It had about half the range we had enjoyed with our Z-Stick, and thus, even with the mesh network throughout our house, couldn't reach certain nodes. Because SmartThings plugs directly into the gateway/router (no WiFi support), it has to be near your gateway, and hence, placement is very restricted... in our case, we could only relocate it to one other area, but it threw everything else out-of-whack.\n\nLooking past that, ignoring a few unreachable nodes, the interface was very...disappointing. SmartThings is designed to run in the cloud on their proprietary platform, and they only (presently) provide an app to interface with the device. Because everything is cloud-based, it requires always-available internet at your house, and has a significant delay in requests to turn things on/off. The delay alone was enough to make us think twice, but the internet requirement (even for programatic timers) was just too much after being spoiled by full local control with the Z-Stick.\n\nDeveloper-wise, they've seemingly hacked on support to write custom scripts via a web interface, but it's far too tedious to bother with for me. In the end, I just couldn't get over the cloud-based proprietary nature of their device, so we ended up sending it back.\n\nWe presently use the Z-Stick with HomeAssistant, which is pretty intuitive and entirely under local control. We have a pretty web and mobile interface (responsive design), and have it proxied through so we can access it outside of our house.\n\nIn the end, if you're ok with cloud-based proprietary control for your devices, SmartThings may be for you. If you're one who likes to be in control, and are comfortable with things like shell scripting, I'd recommend a Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5 coupled with an always-on computer at your house, or a Raspberry Pi, etc.."}

Samsung prompts new users to install their \"new\" app. After much confusion and time wasted I learn I need the \"Classic\" app to control the Smart Lock. Installation and setup should have taken maybe 10 minutes, ended up taking 3 hours.\n\nThe installation process - which should be very easy - was complicated because I kept getting an error \"Device already exists\" when trying to add the hub to the SmartThings app. This was at 7:00 pm PDT on a weeknight. The Samsung website says customer service hours go until 12 am EST so I gave them a call. after drilling through their menu, I got a message saying they were closed. I tried the option of \"Live Chat\", but that turns out to be a \"bot\" that doesn't deal with the SmartThings product. Trying to find troubleshooting or manuals on the website was a total fail. Finally, after a lot of web searching I found a page showing how to do a factory reset. This fixed the problem and I was able to use the provided Welcome Code. I never would have found this page by navigating the Samsung website, only by searching the web for the particular error message (and even then not so easy).\n\nI had, as instructed, installed the \"new\" SmartThings app, which is completely useless. It could tell me whether the door was locked or not, but it would not let me lock or unlock the door within the app, much less program door codes.\n\nSo installed the Classic app (again, after much web-scouring trying to figure out what could be wrong). Classic has a better interface. Still doesn't allow you to add/delete codes. For that you need another plug-in, SmartLocks. Not that smart though, because you can't put expirations/schedules on codes. For that you need to get a developer app. I don't know how to do that because I quit there and figured I'll live with this. Another BIG issue: after you set the code for a certain person, the app will no longer display what that code is anymore! So if I forget what code I assigned to Suzie then i have to delete it and make a new one. Do I really have to write down the user codes and keep them somewhere??? Instead of store them in the app???\n\nMy Smart Lock is on a vacation rental. I want to set codes that last for each person's individual stay, plus permanent codes for housekeeper, myself, etc, plus one-time codes for plumber, painter, etc when work is being done. It doesn't seem that complex! I wonder if I would have gone with Vera or another hub if this capability would have been included.\n\nI can't speak to any of the other Smart Home device management as I just have the lock."}

It's annoying and - at the same time - a security hole because the alarm system doesn't always activate when I am away. I thought this would improve when I transitioned from my iPhone to a Samsung S7 but it did not affect the outcome. I live in the middle of Los Angeles.\n2. I received false alarms on the motion sensor frequently. When this occurs you're freaking out and waiting for a door sensor to trigger as a two-step verification but then realize that one of the - included - door sensors does not work. It's just disappointing.\n3. The outlet switch stopped working 1-year after the purchase, and then one of the door monitors died as well.\n4. The app very rarely gets updated. The app doesn't have a ton of options, you're not going to be lost in all of the things this thing can do. For example, you can't put the wall socket on a count-down timer. If a room temperature sensor reaches X, you can't turn on the wall socket to engage a fan or air conditioner. Which part of this system is smart...the sensors have been around for decades. The control system is average and there is plenty of room for improvement.\n\nBottom-line: If you're serious about home security, spend a little more money and don't buy this product. Read the 1 - 3 star reviews. I've had my system for a little over a year and I am not confident that I know what's going on at home when I am away."}

Most of these I've experienced personally, some I've not.

Developing on the Wink platform is a bit painful and the community isn't as vibrant, so I thought I'd switch. Well, step one was just trying to get it to work out of the box. Turns out I didn't get that far.\n\nI can't even describe how beyond terrible the apps are. I'm running on a Galaxy S8 (latest Samsung flagship phone) running Samsung apps on a Samsung SmartThings. You'd assume I would have the best possible experience here. There's a \"legacy\" app that doesn't seem to be able to add the hub anymore. The new method is apparently Samsung Connect. That app would get most of the way through the setup process and fail with a \"please contact support\" message. Note that the \"contact support\" message wasn't even nice enough to provide a website or contact info. Eventually I found that after I exited the app, it had installed the hub, but told me I hadn't completed the setup. The setup told me the hub was already registered to another user (me). I performed a factory reset, and did the same thing again. Try three I found out that if I just closed the app right as it was adding the hub, I could re-launch and finish the setup properly.\n\nFinally, after having the hub paired with the app, time to add my ZWave devices. Strike 1 - doesn't work with Lutron unless I buy their hub. Strike 2 - doesn't work with Nest. Strike 3 - got it paired to one of my simple smart switches, I can turn it on all day long with the app, but not off. This may not be the hub's fault - I'm not 100% sure if it had good signal strength and it was a 'generic' switch. However, the Wink hub in the same room had no issues. Strike 4 - Bali Autoview absolutely would not pair (wouldn't discover it - as a debug step I re-paired it to a Z-Wave remote and to my Wink Hub successfully, re-tried with Samsung to no avail). I don't see how it was a signal strength issue, the hub was line-of-sight in the opposite corner of the same room.\n\nSo - a few hours after opening the box, I had it half-working with one of my smart devices. The hardware experience was poor, the app experience was even worse. No thank you."}

After researching different hubs, I settled on the SmartThings hub because of the price versus what all it interfaces with. For $80, I have been exceptionally pleased.\nSetting up the hub was basically take it out of the box and plug it into the wall outlet and modem. It goes through the process of setting up on its own, after you enter your WiFi password. Be advised, mine came with a set of instructions that showed a \u2018group\u2019 of lights on the front, and explained what these lights mean. The unit I got came with only 1 light....about the size of the end of a paper clip wire. I thought it was a \u2018reset\u2019 button it was so small. After reading on the SmartThings community, I determined that this was the most current light set-up and 1 little dot is what I was looking for.\nI plugged the unit in, entered my password, entered the asked for information....and.....I waited! It took nearly half an hour to power up, go through its diagnostics, and perform endless updates. Throughout this process, however, the 1 little light did blink and change colors in accordance with the instructions. The light finally turned steady green and the hub was ready to go.\nThe App is fairly straight forward and intuitively usable. I installed two switches and 2 light bulbs in table lamps, then started adding these into routines. So far, everything I have installed has been pair able right out of the box. I have been setting up different routines in the app, just to get used to setting devices up and into usable functions, such as turning off lights for bedtime. I Am so happy with my setup that I am proceeding with my smart home project by replacing all of the switches in the house with smart switches and adding motion sensors, thermostat, and locks.\nI would STRONGLY encourage anyone reading this that is interested in setting up a SmartThings hub to READ about smart devices and what they can (and cannot) do. I admit, I was EXTREMELY pessimistic going into this project, I was definitely not expecting it to be this easy, and I was not expecting everything to be \u201cplug and play\u201d as advertised. I have been very pleased with both!\nSince I started writing this, I have installed 2 motion sensors that were NOT \u201cplug and play\u201d... they had to be \u2018finessed\u2019 in the SmartThings device handler....GET VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SMARTTHINGS COMMUNITY!!!!! I don\u2019t think there is anything that they can\u2019t walk you through and they keep it simple enough that I could follow what they were doing. Everything I have set up....works!"}

I'm just trying to use it for detecting leaks and warning me, but it's incredibly frustrating. 1) Devices will go offline with no warning. SmartThings doesn't try to fix the connection. Even after I added range extenders, the devices will just sit there offline, and not warn me when they become \"unavailable.\" This has happened to me maybe 10 times with various water leak sensors. 2) Audio notifications simply don't work. I have a Sonos connected that is supposed to play a warning in the case of a water leak. It didn't work. So I got a SmartThings alarm hoping that would fix it. Nope. It's the app. It WILL NOT play audio notifications, even though it says it will.\n\nSo I got the hub and water leak sensors to have some peace of mind. I don't go into my basement often, and I don't want a second flood. Unfortunately, Samsung can't offer real peace of mind.\n\nI really do applaud Samsung allowing any Z-Wave device. They're not closing their ecosystem, so you could, in theory, get some really cool home automation. In real life, though, it's just not there yet.

They're kinda spendy, but work great and it's really nice being able to just ask Alexa to turn on or off the lights in the morning when we wake up, go to bed or leave for work. Pairing with the hub was super easy and it works great.\n\nThen I added some Visonic MCT-340 door/window sensors to a few doors and our backyard gate and shed. Nice being able to get an alert should someone open a gate/etc while we're gone. Again, pairing with the SmartThings hub couldn't be any easier.\n\nNext up was a GogoGate2 garage door opener. Turns out the GogoGate2 only support IFTTT integration and nobody has written the necessary code for direct SmartThings integration. I'm going to blame myself for not doing my homework, but kinda makes the point that you really have to do your homework before you buy things and expect them to just work.\n\nSo I did more research and picked out the Linear GoControl garage door controller. While the GogoGate2 would require a lot of work (writing custom Groovy code) this worked out of the box and was super easy to pair with the SmartThings hub. This is pretty useful in the SmartThings app, but sadly the Alexa integration is basically non-existent which an Amazon imposed issue, not with SmartThings. Apparently, for \"security reasons\" you can't use Alexa to open or unlock doors. Oddly, you can't even ask Alexa if the garage door is open, which seems kinda stupid. Something to keep in mind!\n\nI've also integrated with our Trane XL1050 thermostat. This was a bit more work as out of the box as Trane/Nexia makes it _really_ hard to integrate with SmartThings. This is because Nexia wants to use the XL1050 as your 'smart hub' and pay Nexia a monthly service fee. Samsung on the other hand doesn't charge a monthly service fee which is why I bought it instead. Anyways, I found the necessary information to connect my XL1050 on this thread:\n\ncommunity.smartthings.com/t/how-do-you-control-a-nexia-thermostat-with-a-smartthings-hub/34046/110\n\nLast up was our Logitech Harmony remote/hub for our entertainment system. Easy peasy. Just type in your harmony username/password and it discovers all your settings.\n\nAnyways, right now I'm reading up on the SmartThings docs to write my own Device Handler and SmartApp for our HTD whole house audio controller. Obviously, this isn't for everyone, but I love the fact that SmartThings is an open and extensible platform for those of us who aren't afraid of using Github and writing some code. If you can code, then pretty much your imagination is the limit when it comes to SmartThings, but if the idea of writing code is either scary or a turn off, realize you can still do a lot of things with the SmartThings Hub, just you've got to do your homework in advance and make sure the other devices are compatible."}

{"Author": "T.J.", "Date": "on February 17, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "No Nest Support But I'm Happy I Got Smartthings.", "Text": "Comparison: After looking at the both the Wink V2 and Samsung Smartthings hub In-store and online it took me a while to make a decision, For me the biggest factor was whether or not they would work with the Devices I already had (5 Wemo Light Switches, 3 Wemo Insight Outlets, 1 Nest Thermostat and 1 Nest Fire & Carbon Monoxide Detector, 1 Ring Doorbell, 2 Sengled Bulbs, 2 Logitech Harmony Hubs, 1 Alexa, 1 Echo Dot and finally 1 Google Home) The first flaw with the smartthings is due too the rivalry of Samsung vs Google. Nest being a google company has no support with or from smartthings. The second flaw is that both have no official support for Wemo however Smartthings integration is possible with the work of smartthings Labs while with Wink there is no communication at all. Meaning while the official Smartthings team has made Wemo integration possible it is not yet official but is available to users through the lab section under the Manually add devices section in app. So too me the Smartthings seemed good but i would not be able to integrate it with nest (Without use of IFTTT) and I have already spent too much to now switch over too ecobee3. The third gripe I have only effects Wink, No harmony support whatsoever but it would work with my nest.\n\nBiggest Points:\nThings that can be Macgyvered to communicate with each other through the use of IFTTT will be marked*\nIFTTT will not allow for use of all features.\n\nWink V2: Wemo* No, Harmony* No, Nest Yes, RIng doorbell Yes (No motion alerts*).\nSmartthings: Wemo Yes (No energy info from Wemo Insight outlets), Harmony Yes, Nest* No, Ring doorbell Yes (Can create routines with motion alerts)\n\nThe Decision: In the end I decided to go with Smartthings as it would control my Wemos and Harmony hubs as well as letting me use my harmony remote to control lighting and outlets and seeing as how the Nest app is very intuitive I decided I'd much prefer using that over either Smartthings or Wink.\n\nReview: I currently have my Smartthings hub communicating directly with all my Wemo's, Harmony Hubs, Ring Doorbell and 2 Sengled Element Light Bulbs. The Communication with all of them is flawless. When someone approaches my Ring Doorbell It sends a motion alert to Smartthings\nWhich then uses the \"If things start happening\" condition to turn my Wemo light switch \"Porch\" on and then after no movement is detected for a set period of time it uses the \"If things quite down\" condition to turn of the porch light. Tested this rule 25 times with it working each time before I was satisfied. Then I paired it with my Sengled lights and it found them in seconds. When switching the non-smart switch the smart lights are on from the Off to the On position the bulbs are re-connected to the Smartthings within 3 seconds (More impressed there by the fact $10 Smart Light Bulbs can connect that fast then the ability of the hub itself). It paired to my most used harmony hub easily, only one can be paired at a time, its a technical limitation that applies to both the google home and alexa or any Harmony compatible smart hub as well. After adding my Smartthings/Samsung account login info in Google Home and both Alexa's they found all the devices paired to my Smartthings hub, I then grouped up my different devices together in the app and tested them out on all my digital assistants. They were all able to run rountins that I had set up such as \"Movie Time\" which turns off my Wemo light Switches as well as the lamps I have on the Wemo Insight outlets. I have also made a routine that turns on my Espresso machine every morning at different times depending on the day of the week using another Wemo Insight switch. I was also able to get my Nest thermostat to perform some predefined actions set in IFTTT when requested by a routine in Smartthings.\n\nFinal Word: Im Happy I Got Smartthings."}

For these reasons, I decided to go with a Samsung SmartThings hub using z-wave for our primary home.\n\nSamsung employs a more open architecture where a community of developers offers additional device drivers and plugin smart apps. While the Apple Home app is simple and elegant, the Samsung app is a bit cumbersome and complicated. However, Samsung makes up for it by providing far more configuration capabilities than does Apple.

I am a tech person but could not decide which direction I wanted to go.... so that got things rolling. After a couple of months and all was working well without a hub, I stumbled across my local HD dumping a couple of WeMo smart plugs and I grabbed the two that they had to add to my collection.\n\nSo I have been operating without a hub and all was happy with the world--- until recently when iHome had server outages and firmware update glitches and since then the outlets have worked about 5% of the time and have had to be unplugged and replugged back in too many times.... needless to say a good old stand alone timer looked tempting to go back to, but I much prefer programming everything from my iPhone...so I decided to look for a hub to eliminate third party issues. Basically it came down to two: the Samsung SmartThings and Wink Hub 2....For the most part it was a tossup and the one deciding factor was that it appeared that the SmartThings hub could control the WeMo outlets whereas the Wink hub was more questionable. So I went with the SmartThings hub and it does control both brands of outlets.\n\nSetup was simple--- I already had setup my app and online account and simply plugged in the hub and the code that came with it into the app--- it took about 5-10min for the hub to update and I was ready to go. It recognized everything (including my Sonos speakers) except the iHome plugs...oh joy....then I thought about it and it appears that the iHome plugs need to have the iHome account linked--- that is fine, but it definitely makes me think about the future with other smart devices....especially the outlets...and here is why.... I want the hub to directly control the outlets...no 3rd party interference in a matter of speaking. This is how the WeMo's work for me--- yes I have their app, but, the SmartThings app and hub do not require any login information--- that is what I am after. So from here on out I have a better understanding of how I want it to work.\n\nOverall the setup is simple and one feature that I truly enjoy is being able to have my lights come on about 20-30min before sunset. From my experience is when they come on at sunset--- it is about that much too late and you have a period of time that the house is too dark... so by being able to have them come on a few minutes earlier solves everything.\n\nSo far the setup is clean and all is working well. It did report that one of my iHome plugs went rogue again and said it was offline.... sure enough when I checked the history of it, it came on and never went off. Thankfully for a 9w LED it is not a big deal to have it stuck on an extra 9-hours and after cycling the power to the smart plug all was back to working again. The layout of the app is colorful and intuitive in its overall layout as so far no instructions necessary.\n\nSize wise, the unit is small-- about 4\" square and 1\" thick. The power adapter is quite small and the small LED on the front of the unit is the perfect size and brightness....big enough to see and know what state it is in without being blinding or obtrusive. It also does use four AA batteries as backup power.\n\nIt does have geo-fencing capabilities and until I get to that point of trying it--- it is currently a dormant feature. I think that may be when I get more controlled outlets and switches that I can have things like the hallway light, kitchen light, and bedroom light all come on when I come home.... yes other lights would already be on, but this would light my path to where I have to disembark from my stuff at the end of a workday---- and with no preset time... that is pretty awesome. I will also have the other lights that I use in the morning go off earlier than programmed when I leave. This way when I go to work--- they go off when I leave. On a weekend, they stay on until the pre-programmed time.\n\nNow the search is on for some other smart devices!"}

Sure, it's an outlet connected to an extension cord, but using these bulbs allow us to control the light without needing to plug/unplug the cord each time, which is very helpful in the dark.\nWill be ordering an 8 pack of these lights soon and replace the rest of the lights throughout the house. Pretty darned cool, and will be much better once the voice controls have even more options.\nFor example, it would be great for google to know who I am by my voice (it does), and react accordingly based on that (it doesn't). This way we could name the rooms and lights, etc., as well as assign ourselves to them and say \"Hey google, turn on my bedroom light\" and it would know based on the voice, who's bedroom light to turn on. My kids could say the same thing and have their lights turn on, or we could use the kids names to turn on each of their rooms.\nYou can do some of this based on the names of the rooms, but it's not quite there when knowing what to do based on who is requesting it.\nEither way, very cool and super helpful.

Simple voice commands to turn on / turn off lights, adjust thermostats, and set timers for functions during the day or night. The hub gets it time from the web, so you don't have to reset timers every time power is lost in a storm. But I don't like the fact that it only has simple one action triggers without applying a second variable.\n\nSmartThings Hub is a very basic product and works only on a single routine command. It uses your cell phone as a presence sensor, so you can set it to adjust the thermostat down when you leave and up when you arrive. Yes it can also turn your lights on when you arrive, but you can't specify after dusk or after sunset. So consequently when you come home from work or shopping in the daytime the lights come on.\n\nNo forethought went into developing the application and allowing \"and/or\" to the triggers for the end user. I contacted tech support and was told by Kyle H. that this is simply not anything their customers would ever want. I mean really? who wants to come home at noon and have all the lights turn on, then you have to turn them off one by one.\n\nThis would be an awesome product if they would bring the capabilities of the application into the realm 21st century."}

Supports Zigbee and Z-Wave.", "Text": "When it works, it works great. The idea is cool, but it's not 100% reliable. I would say 80%. It IS emerging technology and seems to get better by the day.\n\nThe pros:\nI can turn on a crock pot, light, or thermostat remotely. It's probably paid for itself and a Z-Wave thermostat this winter. It supports Z-Wave AND Zigbee protocols which means more selection of devices. However, not every device will have a proper handler. They will either pair properly, not pair at all, or pair with limited functionality. I've found adjusting the handler in the web based back end gets a few devices to show up a generic item with basic functionality. Again, this is getting better with time, and there are constantly new devices being created by lots of different competing brands.\n\nThe cons:\nSome of the user experience in the app is poorly designed. If you have to manage multiple hubs, (home/work/shop/cottage/etc.) and have multiple users the app... I have access to a work hub with my work ST login. I set up my home hub with my personal ST login, but have to add my work account as a user to be able to access both in the app at the same time. My phone as a presence sensor only actively toggles present or away for the hub I am viewing in the app. If I show up at work and am not viewing the work hub, but then view the work hub, my presence (phone) shows up to work at some point in the day. If I forget to toggle back to home hub before I pull into the driveway, my heat won't turn on. I go to bed later, and my phone 'arrives' at 3am or so, my heat turns on and I wake up sweating.\n\nThen location starts working properly again. Then it stops working after an update, then 3 weeks later it starts working again and i get an email two days later saying my firmware was updated, etc.\n\nWhen it doesn't work as noted above, it sucks cause your lights might not work, your garage door might not open, your thermostat might not turn on or off, your security system becomes non-existent, etc.\nSupport/communication from Samsung is pretty good in the cases I've opened with them, but response time on actually getting bugs fixed is another story.\n\nAll programability is stored in the cloud, not on the device, so if your internet goes down, so does your smart home. Why does it have battery backup? If your house loses power, your router goes down, you are SOL.\n\nImprovements? Make many-many hub-user relationships sensible in the app, or support multiple logins. Add SIM card feature for backup cellular internet connectivity, add local programability, make the usb ports usable for something other than 5v power, support a wifi dongle to make it wire independent, or a 3g dongle to make it redundant in case of power outage. At least devices with battery power would still be useful."}

{"Author": "Lance P. Welsh", "Date": "on January 21, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Unreliable, poor UI.", "Text": "Update (down to one star): even worse problems, unfortunately designed this way - consider this common scenario: your set a light (or scene of lights) to turn on when a motion sensor starts, and off after motion stops, as I've done for my yard lights.\n\nI just discovered that these bright lights have been on for 10 hours because the hub missed the stop signal from the motion sensor.\n\nMissing a signal shouldn't be such a problem, but the UI only has logic to \"turn off only after receiving a stop signal\" (with an optional time extension like 10 minutes). If the stop signal is missed, the lights will stay on forever.\n\nA much more reasonable and reliable way to run this logic is \"turn these lights on with motion\" and \"leave them on for 10 minutes after the last motion start signal\".\n\nMotion sensors generate many start signals with motion but end with only one stop signal, so depending on that single stop signal is a problem.\n\nThere's so many obvious ways these common problems could be avoided, and it makes no sense that SmartThings hasn't thought of them or implemented them. For instance, these sensors could also be queried to verify the state which the hub thinks they are in.\n\nTypical engineering solutions without checking to see if they're really solving instead of creating problems. Can be solved with code, so this is a product for programmers, or users that are entertained thinking this is magic, or just very tolerant.\n\n---===---\n\nThe SmartThings app UI is poorly designed - out-of-box experience is that you have to leave the app to create an account. Yet it has to be done in the mobile browser. There is no desktop functionality, via the web or an app. The mobile app is clunky and ugly.\n\nOnce back in the app the functionality is limited. For instance, lights can only be turned on and off - not dimmed. I'd like to create a \"Movies\" scene with some dim lights, but not possible (without writing my own routines, using other apps, IFTTT). These and other common needs should've been obvious to implement.\n\nIf Samsung can't even get the simple stuff right, forget about such niceties as cloning a scene (say perhaps copy the \"Movies\" scene and tweak it for \"Dining\" without having to add and set each light from scratch again).\n\nEven if the aesthetics were nice and the functionality was good, the system is unreliable. This hub doesn't retry a light when it fails to turn. Worse yet, and inexplicably, it doesn't even report that a light failed to turn. For instance, my \"leave\" scene specifies all six lights off, and inevitably there's always one or two left on. If I don't check each light myself, they will be left on all day. It's not good enough to check the app, because sometimes the reported state isn't correct as well. Sometimes there are large delays, commands get stuck and queued-up, which makes it even more confusing.\n\nNo way this should this hub be used on anything that needs to be reliably set - I will not allow it to control my locks, garage opener, or appliances. I had these same devices on an Aeon z-wave controller which was reliable.\n\nOne more big problem - the hub should be \"centrally located\" amongst the devices it controls, but it also needs to be near the router since it's not wireless (unbelievable nowadays). Fine if your router happens to be in the center of your house, otherwise you have to choose between stringing an ethernet cable and sacrificing range (which further degrades the already poor range and reliability).\n\nAfter years of hype and development, the smart home is still generally for techies and evangelists. Too unreliable and primitive for most others. This hub doesn't change that - it's basically just a $100 useless toy.\n\nGiving this hub an extra star because it's not completely broken and does some things it says it can do. For instance, there's some useful and thoughtful utilities like the general z-wave exclusion so old devices don't have to be reset before being paired with this controller/hub."}

{"Author": "KevinB", "Date": "on January 16, 2018", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Reliability is a big issue with mine.", "Text": "First, I\u2019m an IT guy so I of course love IoT and all tech things that can make my life easier. I originally purchased several different automation devices - WeMo switches, Lifx Bulbs, Lutron Caseta, TP-Link bulbs and a bunch Insteon in wall switches as well as sensors. I eventually settled on Insteon. It was and is still extremely reliable with a broad range of products. I\u2019ve seen very few outages and it works very well with Alexa. I didn\u2019t initially land on SmartThings, because dollar for dollar for the different supported devices, Insteon was less expensive. I also didn\u2019t know enough about Z-wave or ZigBee and the numerous devices already out.\n\nRecently, I had some Somfy shades installed with Zwave integration and the main option was of course SmartThings. Unfortunately, while they can be added to ST, you need a custom device handler and they have yet to work as well as I want them to. In any case, this opened my eyes to what ST can potentially do. Through community developed apps I\u2019ve integrated my Nest, Amazon Echos, bridged my Insteon devices, Lifx and TP Link bulbs and even added my Plex server.\n\nBenefits\nSeveral different standards and integrations - Z-Wave, ZibBee, WiFI / IP devices - you\u2019re not limited to just what you see in SmartThings market place, there are many more devices.\nCommunity created integrations - There\u2019s just so many out there, it\u2019s crazy. If there\u2019s an API, somebody will write an integration for it.\n\nDrawbacks\nUnstable and un-reliable platform. Since installing the SmartThings Hub I\u2019ve had 5 major outages (not in my home) in less than 30 days for long periods. As I write this, my system is down yet again.\n\nPoor Integration within the same eco system and company - One would think that Samsung would make a better attempt to integrate their products with SmartThings. Align their roadmaps and slowly release capabilities and new features into their other products. Other than the name, they are basically separate companies. Casing point - I was going to buy a 2017 Samsung UHD TV thinking it would have some hooks to ST. No dice, only the 2016 versions had it and it was very, very limited.\n\nCommunity created integrations - while this a benefit, it is also can be a drawback in that this is not for the casual user. To implement a lot of these expanded capabilities, you need some decent technical knowledge. Very few things work well out of the box and require you to log in update say device drivers and/or apps.\n\nBlueTooth - I as well as many, many people in the ST community have been waiting for this feature to be turned on. It seems like it could be a game changer, but after several releases, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a priority for ST.\n\nBottomline - if you\u2019re comfortable and like technical challenges, go with ST. If you want a simple, reliable system then go with something like Insteon."}

{"Author": "BR from SF", "Date": "on December 21, 2017", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "way more once you introduce smart locks, thermostats", "Text": "Anyone who is interested in investing in the SmartThings ecosystem should be aware of the following:\n\n1. This \"hub\" is nothing but a set of antannae that sends/recieves information from your connected sensors/devices and forwards it on to the SmartThings cloud, where all the processing takes place. For example, say you wanted to turn on a light...so you open the SmartThings app on your phone, then press the button to turn the light on. Your phone forwards your command to the cloud where all of your devices are registered, then sends the 'on' command over the internet and down to your hub, which then broadcasts (via short range radio) the command to your device. The hub has zero functionality without the cloud whatsoever.\n\n2. The SmartThings cloud platform constantly has issues. Google \"SmartThings status\" to find their status page and look through the history of incidents. I count 30 between 1/1/18 and 4/20/18. If your just getting into SmartThings and suddenly your whole system stops working, how are you supposed to know that the cloud platform is broken and not your system? There's no documentation that tells you to go to the internet and check the platform status - you just automatically think your system broke and don't know why.\n\n3. Although this \"hub\" isn't too much money, realize that it is worthless without sensors and devices to connect with. SmartThings-branded sensors are fairly expensive and are really poorly made. Please read reviews of Samsung SmartThings Arrival Sensors, Motion Detectors, cameras etc. to get an idea of the cost and quality. Figure out for yourself what the total cost is for your particular needs. You could spend hundreds of dollars just on a few door/window sensors and a few motion detectors...way more once you introduce smart locks, thermostats, and light bulbs into your system. This reminds me of buying an ink jet printer for super cheap only to find the replacement ink cartridges costing an arm and leg.\n\n3. This is NOT a real home security system. Although there is a module in the SmartThings app called \"Smart Home Monitor\" that is what they are advertising as a security system, you must program the whole thing yourself with \"if this then do that\" type of rules. There is no out-of-the-box functionality for home security unless you buy the ADT version of the system. While simple rules can be setup using the SmartThings app, any situation that requires any type of complexity, like wait 30 seconds before setting off the alarm when a door is opened - will require you to login to the cloud and code your own routines using a Java-type language called \"Groovy.\" There is also a community-based rules engine project for the techno-savy. Even if you do just simply want an alarm to go off if a door or window is opened, YOU have to write the rules that make it happen, whether it's through the SmartThings app or using the cloud-based development environment. Of course you also have to buy a SmartThings compatible siren - - unless you just want to receive a text message when you're being burglarized.\n\n4. You don't need to - and probably shouldn't - buy SmartThings-branded sensors to work with this hub. As I said in point #1, this hub is just a pair of antanae that send/receive using the Zigbee and Z-wave protocols. These protocols are not proprietary to Samsung, so other manufacturers devices will work with this hub. You can download the SmartThings app and look in the \"Marketplace\" tab to see which devices have device handlers (drivers) that are available for this hub. For example, I would recommend Nest or Arlo cameras over the Samsung cameras, which actually, aren't even made by Samsung. I have door open/close sensors that cost half the price of SmartThings sensors and don't chew through batteries so quickly.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to anyone who is considering investing in a SmartThings system. Just keep in mind that things can get expensive really fast. I saw the hub on sale at BB and picked it up on a whim only to find it didn't do much without the add-ons. By the time I had bought the hub, 5 motion sensors, 7 door/window sensors, 2 cameras, a siren and a Phillips Hue starter kit, I had spent $1,200. Then of course you'll want to integrate it with Alexa or Google Home, so throw in a few hundred more for Echos in each room... then you'll want a compatible TV so you can change the channel with Alexa... anyways, it can become a money pit real fast.\n\nI'm giving this device 2 stars because once you spend enough $ to get all the things you'll expect from a home automation system, you'll wonder how you ever got along without it... but I'm a systems engineer and am comfortable dealing with technological challenges. Only 2 stars because this product really does seem to still be in beta testing, and I'm really bothered by how expensive the SmartThings-branded sensors/devices are given their pathetic quality."}

This allows you to automate various things in your home. You must purchase compatible items in addition to this to make it work. You also need a hardwire network outlet to plug into. This connects the hub to your home network (and therefore to your smartphone wherever you are in the world). The hub communicates with the automation devices wirelessly, so should be centrally located in your home.\n\nThis hub supports several different protocols. I have z-wave. I purchased z-wave outlets and switches, installed those, and then connected the hub using the smartphone app. In addition to being able to control lighting without having to walk to the switch, which can be very convenient when the switch for the floodlights is in the bedroom but you're outside and it's getting dark, but you can also program routines where it will turn lights on and off when you're not there to make it seem someone is there. Very useful if you're on vacation.\n\nA wide range of devices are available, including garage door openers and \"smart locks\". Personally I wouldn't want the ability to open my home remotely, but it does exist for those who do want it. I find controlling lights and the vacation lighting routines to be well worth the cost of this hub and the z-wave outlets and switches.\n\nIf you have a smart assistant, like the Google Home, you can link that to the hub also so that a simple voice command turns on lights. My favorite is to tell the assistant \"activate goodnight\" so that it will run the \"goodnight\" routine that turns everything off. No need to double-check before going to bed, just tell the assistant to run \"goodnight\"."}

The type shown on This Old House was exorbitantly expensive so I checked out EcoNet, Dome, and some other valves. It seems all the cheaper valves require a hub. Amazon had the SmartThings hub on sale for $49 so I just went with it and 4 water sensors at $30 each. This hub requires an ethernet cable and an open port on your router or wireless, but is not wireless itself. Plug it into the net, plug in the power, go online to the SmartThings site, set up an account, enter the code that came with the hub, and sit back and wait. I think it took about 15 minutes until it finally said that the hub was installed.\n\nAfter that, the water sensors were brought to about 10' from the hub and the battery activated. They appeared immediately on the app on your smartphone and there or on the Samsung site you name or rename the hubs. I got a Dome auto shutoff and it was a bit more problematic to link to the hub, but pushing the button on the valve 3x as fast as you can got it linked-3 times slowly didn't do it. The Dome valve is Z-Wave and the ST water sensors are Zigbee. With this hub you don't know the difference; your online account site will tell you which is which if you want to know with actual zigbee addresses or the ZWave device number shown in a table.\n\nI've checked it out a few times by dampening a sensor and it works fine. The sensor under the washing machine got dropped once so I moved it out a bit away from all the metal and it hasn't dropped since. The metal appliances must have been weakening the signal.\n\nI don't have any plans to use it for lights or doorbells and such.

Once installed I took for granted it was working; standing sentry over my safety. WRONG!!\nI am a 71 year old man who lives alone. My neighborhood is a high crime neighborhood with many home break-ins and many shipments stolen off of the front porch.\nI set up the Hub and positioned 6 sensors, 3 for door opening and 3 motion. I place a security door bar on my bedroom door at night.\nMY PLAN: If the Samsung security system detects either a door opening or a motion, an alarm will sound on my phone, giving me time to wake up, chamber a round, assume a defensive position on the side of the bed opposite the door and call 911.\nUnfortunately, in tests, conducted recently (me walking out into the sensored area, opening doors and walking under the motion sensors) the Samsung Hub security system rarely ever activated the loud siren notification sound on my phone, thus rendering the system useless. On the phone screen the sensors clearly show they are activating based on motion or a door opening\u2026.all of them work. But audio notification is not activated.\nFor this system to be effective an audible notification MUST activate. Whether you are traveling or out to dinner or whatever, the system must get your attention. But it doesn\u2019t. Rarely does it ever sound the audio notification.\nI am very disappointed and am looking for a different system.\n\nUpdate March 26, 2018:\n\nJust got back from a 10 day trip. I regularly check SmartThings on my Samsung S7 to insure no one has entered my house and caused a motion or intrusion alert. The system still does not notify me with an audible alert, even though I have spent hours and hours re-installing, re-booting etc. During this trip I noticed 2 of the sensors showed acceptable battery power, 86% but were listed now as UNAVAILABLE!!! When I cam home yesterday, I popped the battery out and then back in and went through the drill of reintroducing it to the system. Still no audible notification EXCEPT on ONE (1) of the 6 sensors, a motion sensor, it will on occasion send my phone an audbile notification when I walk under it, but not always.\n\nThe system is dangerous!!!! Because: You count on it alerting you if there is an intruder, and even though mine is a second generation it doesn't do that except now and then on only one of the 6 sensors. ALSO at random a sensor becomes 'UNAVAILABLE' while you're gone and you CANNOT reboot it remotely.\n\nFor a security system to be effective it must be reliable, always on alert, always ready to send you an audible signal that readily gets your attention. You must be able to sleep or enter your home/apartment with the confidence that your security system is on alert and prepared to notify you 24/7.\n\nThis system is dangerous and frustrating, so last night I threw it in the trash."}

Getting this and the Echo to recognize the bulbs took a little more effort than I thought it would but it works amazing! I am able to recognize and control not only my bulbs but my satellite receiver and more. Just purchased the Harmony Hub and it worked almost out of the box. Make sure of a couple things first: Make sure that ALL of your Smart Home gadgets are on the same network, including the TV, Satellite, etc; use the app for Smart Things in order to get everything recognizable; if you are using Alexa, it will [usually] take a minute or two for things on your SmartThings to be recognized. Be patient and read the instructions. Overall, so far I highly recommend this for home automation. The further I go with automating everything, I may end up buying another!"}

I've had Wink for about 6 months now and my biggest complaint with Wink is that it is a closed system. Consequently, Wink supports a limited number of products. Wink's approach is to keep the user experience clean. Its noble, however it really limits the product. SmartThings is open, there are a ton of 3rd party supported products plus they support a ton more products in general. I did lose my NEST Thermostat capability with the SmartThings app, but I don't really need it. I've found that since I actually live in my home I'm not friggin' with the thermostat enough to bother.\n\nSmartThings is a better product. I've found the customization extremely useful and well done. It also actually (even though Wink walks you through the process nicely) has better at inclusion workflow. I like the way they leave the app in inclusion mode and you can walk around to your devices and get them connected. The automation is also better... I like the structure of the routines in SmartThings better than Robots in Wink. You can do more inside one routine and the UI is better in my opinion. The SmartThings unit itself is considerably smaller than Wink and feels a little cheaper (mechanically). SmartThings does add battery backup which is nice but you better have your network equipment on a UPS, if you don't then the batteries won't matter.\n\nI had a couple of switches that Wink always had problems maintaining a connection... this is not happening with the SmartThings hub, not sure why but its nice to have those switches back on-line."}

We use seven Echo Dots (so far) for voice automation, lists, games for the grandkids, and a Hue bridge for lights. I\u2019m looking at Harmony hubs to handle our own entertainment systems because we buy our own content. The single lesson I have learned since starting down the smart home path, is that no one device does it all well.

So far, I've installed 10 ea. Schlage Connect locks on my exterior doors, and a Sonos Connect streaming device. I've also set up an Amazon Echo Dot, so I can use voice control with all of the devices. Having added a virtual switch that I set up in IDE, I can also use the Echo to lock the doors. It's worth noting that Echo does not allow setting up locks directly, for security reasons. Therefore, I followed their lead and set up locking only, forgoing the use of voice control for unlocking. Also, for the Schlage locks, I can heartily recommend Rboy Apps for SmartThings, as their Door Lock App and Universal Lock Device Handler have made setting up the locks, including adding and deleting codes, much easier.\n\nAt this point, everything is working very well, with all devices reacting properly and reporting their status almost immediately when commands are sent."}

At this point in time the SmartThings hub has at least three huge advantages over its competitors:\n1. It has a great out of box experience where it works with a large set of tightly integrated devices with minimal setup involved typically just involving wizard flows. This includes all of the SmartThings branded accessories as well as pretty much anything on this page - https://www.smartthings.com/products.\n2. It has an amazingly active community of users and developers who build custom Device Handlers and SmartApps to greatly extend the functionality and compatibility of the SmartThings hub. Because of that, the SmartThings hub can stitch together your disparate ZigBee, Z-Wave, and Wi-Fi based devices (e.g. like the ones from TP-Link and WeMo) into a single point of control and automation.\n3. It has the support of a large company that is unlikely to go bankrupt or give up on smart home automation anytime soon. if anything, Samsung is continuing to heavily invest in smart home automation and I believe standards like ZigBee and Z-Wave have reached a sufficient level of maturity that most smart home components bought today will last for at least another decade of iterative hub controllers and compatible accessories.\n\nOverall, I love my SmartThings hub and it has truly become the center of my smart home. My only advice to you - try to purchase Z-Wave or ZigBee (in that order) devices for your home when possible. Wi-Fi based switches and other accessories from companies like TP-Link, WeMo, etc.\nmight occasionally have a shiny feature that your really like or attract you with their \"hub-less\" advertisements but they will always be dependent on the whims of network quality, unstable services, unsupported device handlers, etc. Nothing beats local execution when it comes to creating a fast and reliable smart home."}

{"Author": "DGK", "Date": "on November 11, 2017", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Worse than the Home Connect, terrible App, questionable wireless reception", "Text": "I bought this as an experiment in home automation for late 2017, specifically comparing it wink hub 2 (2016 release) and the home connect (also returned). I ended up returning it for a number of reasons.\n\nSmartThings was aquired by Samsung, who has taken the standalone hub and started down the path of uniting it with a mesh router. The Home Connect (or pro). Unfortunately, the Home Connect is a terrible router and a worse mesh router. There are serious latency issues that appear every minute or so, creating lag on voice calls that makes it untenable. The Home Connect Pro is significantly slower and less perform at than the 2011 Apple AirPort Extreme. That is a fact. Coupled with this are features that are either broken or buggy (parental control for example). So why mention the Connect Home products? Because as a SmartThings hub, they actually work quite well. I had no issues with lag or reception on any of the wireless in wall dimmers or motion sensors around the house (z wave). However as a WiFi system these had to go...\n\nSo I resolved to try the older SmartThings hub (this product). And...\n\nReception\n\nReception suddenly became an issue. Same devices, same locations for everything, including the hub and... dimmers no longer working. I purchased a plug to extend the z wave and...still not much joy. Mostly it works, but then occasionally the status is not received or the switch fails to function. If something isn\u2019t reliable then it is defective.\n\nThe app\n\nI\u2019m used to great apps and a perfect user interface. I\u2019m an iPhone user and I expect perfection in these areas. Do a search for SmartThings and you\u2019ll see a 2 or 2.5 star rating for the latest version. I found the app to be difficult to navigate and overly complicated, specifically compared to the wink app which is much MUCH better, cleaner and more professional on every level. Beyond that, inconsistent and slow status updates and a clunky overall feel, with areas that seem like duplicates and bizarre buttons all over the place. Yes it works, but it is clearly not well designed. I frankly don\u2019t understand how Samsung could release such a product, unless this is the norm.\n\nSo, this has gone back to amazon and I am sticking with the wink hub which is leaps and bounds better. Beyond that, I have also moved to Lutron Caseta dimmers as they work flawlessly and are much less cheap feeling than the leviton z wave dimmers (rebranded ge/jasco is my guess). Caseta Connect directly to the wink hub.\n\nAnother major issue is lack of WiFi on the smartthings hub. We all know that WiFi routers can\u2019t often be placed perfectly. For other wireless devices like z wave etc... the placement of the hub is critical. Higher and more central is better. Who has a cable in the center of their house? Second floor? Unlikely. The wink hub can be placed anywhere and so far has functioned flawlessly.\n\nSorry Samsung, but this product is outdated and outclassed. You\u2019ve been warned."}

I was coming from the Wink Smart hub and moved over to SmartThings when wink was purchased by i.am - his products just seem to go downhill.\n\nSo a bit about my setup - I have a few Schlage locks ( Schlage Z-Wave Connect Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt with Built-In Alarm, Works with Amazon Alexa via SmartThings, Wink or Iris, Satin Nickel, BE469 CAM 619 ) and a few Blink security cameras ( Blink Home Security Camera System for Your Smartphone with Motion Detection, HD Video, 2 Year Battery and Cloud Storage Included - 3 Camera Kit ) . I was surprised and really disappointed that SmartThings and Schlage didn't have anything built in.\n\nThen came rboyapps to the rescue. It just so happened that the 2 things I really like (my locks and camera), rboyapps makes custom device handlers and Smart apps that integrate seamlessly. I'll say that I know nothing about programming this stuff or what a device handler is or anything like that, but their site has step by step instructions. Basically you go to your Samsung account, copy and paste a few things and then it shows up in your apps. I will say that I thought about purchasing the products for a week or so because its a few dollars, but I just couldn't find anything as good and after a while was thinking something like \"I've spent 20 or 30 bucks on much dumber things - like a fake horse skeleton for halloween, but I digress, haha\".\n\nAnyway, back to the app...The apps they have created lets you remotely change codes, unlock lock, set expiring times, perform all kinds of cool actions when the lock is locked/unlocked for the lock.\n\nWith the Blink Camera smart app, I believe (like 99% sure) they worked directly with the Blink company and create some cool software to integrate DIRECTLY with your blink cameras. Arming/Disarming, watching the cameras, changing settings, etc (again - all from within smartThings).\n\nSo what I had programmed with their software was that when me or my wife locked the Schlage lock from the keypad, it would automatically ARM the blink cameras. Really cool feature, but what I found out was that after we would lock the lock and the blink cameras would ARM, we didn't have enough time to get out of the garage with the car where one of the cameras were - I wanted to have a delay between the locking of the lock and the arming of the blink camera. So....\n\nI contacted them with their support email asking them about the feature or a way it could be done. Maddie responded within 10 minutes walking me through a couple other questions I had and then indicated that it was not possible but would mark it as a future feature for the developers. That was 2 days ago.\n\nMaddie sent me an email today indicating that this new feature is now in the smart app and all I had to do was follow the step by step instructions for an update. It works flawlessly and me and my wife are really excited. More so me, because I set all this stuff up and she was getting annoyed with all the technology, but she is really coming around.\n\nSo now, we can lock the Schlage lock, have the lock app automatically wait a number of minutes I tell it to and then arm the blink cameras. Gives us enough time to get out of the garage.\n\nI know I may sound like a paid shill or whatever and they didn't give me any discounts or any free stuff. I paid full price for the software, but their team works really hard and is super responsive, and I really appreciate that, I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nIf you have blink cameras or schlage locks, or both (like me), don't spend hours upon hours searching for something awesome and free - it doesn't exist - I tried. I don't work for them, but if you have any questions about my setup with or without their stuff, I can answer.\n\nThanks,\nMatt"}

Also, you can't view live video or respond to a doorbell from the ST app, you have to use the native Ring app. The work arounds for all this either require you to code apps or find one that someone has done and load it, which I haven't taken the time to figure out yet.\n\nI haven't changed out anything related to lighting or added security to my home yet, but I guess when I do that, this will be more useful."}

The typical response logged on the forums is, \"Uh, we don't see anything on our end going wrong...\" Considering how long this has be going on, that's just Samsung's nice way of saying, \"I got your money.

We finally bought a house and I thought I'd take a step up from our Hue-only setup we'd been using in our rental for a few years. Here's what I bought:\n\nSamsung SmartThings hub, three z-wave dimmers, two z-wave switches, and a Honeywell WiFi\n\nInitial setup: The software was glitchy and it took multiple attempts to sign in to my previously-existing Samsung account. Multiple user setup is also not very clear.\n\nDevice setup: Z-Wave linkage wasn't difficult. Sometimes it takes a dimmer one or two tries to pair with the hub.\n\nLinking other hubs: Linking the Philips Hue hub took a couple of tries. The status of the Hue devices does not properly reflect on the list of devices under the Samsung SmartThings app \"My Home\" tab.\n\nControlling individual lights or rooms: Just awful implementation, Samsung! It takes multiple steps to get to any one device to adjust it. You have to go to \"My Home,\" then select either the \"Things\" or \"Rooms\" tab, and then toggle the device. But what if you need to dim a light? You need to select the device, then tap the percentage icon (which is not intuitive at all), and then select the brightness. It's a COMPLETELY wacky and laborious way to set the brightness of any of your devices. Want to dim an entire room? Nope. Not possible in the app. This is easily doable and completely intuitive with other systems like Philips Hue, by contrast.\n\nHub independence: Certain features work and other features don't work if you're absent an internet connection. At least with Philips Hue, you can go into the official app or Huemote and change device brightness if you're on the WLAN. But, with SmartThings, it's not so smart! If you don't have an internet connection, the app itself refuses to work. Nevermind the fact you're on the same WLAN and have a solid connection between your phone/computer and the router (and hence, the SmartThings hub), it just doesn't work. Automated routines will work (like if you have a Z-Wave switch set up to trigger multiple lights, or if you have a sensor set up), but the app just refuses to work. It's incredibly frustrating. What's the point of having a local system if it relies on an internet connection for basic functionality? Plus, the hub has two AA batteries in it as a backup... I have no idea what the batteries do since your lights wouldn't work anyway in the case of a power outage.\n\nLatency: Slow. I find the Samsung SmartThings system to be flat out slow compared to Philips Hue. And since my Hue system is now linked through the SmartThings hub, everything I do with the Hue lights is now slow too.\n\nWidgets: Great concept, I just wish it were easier to get to them in iOS 11. Lots of swiping involved. This is more of a criticism of Apple, but I wish you could put widgets on your home screen like you can with many Android applications.\n\nAlexa: Because Samsung's SmartThings app is such a pile of trash, we rely mostly on our three Amazon Echo Dots in the house to control the lights. The downside to this is that you need to configure each room separately in your Alexa app on your phone. This means anytime you change room/device configuration in the SmartThings app, you'll need to reconfigure Alexa in your Alexa app as well. Once it's up and running, it's effective. We have rooms set up for \"downstairs,\" \"kitchen,\" \"bedroom,\" and \"office,\" and Alexa responds well. Still, not all of the lights turn on/off or dim at the same time, but perhaps that's just a limitation of the Z-Wave protocol.\n\nOverall, I'm not very impressed with what SHOULD be a polished, fantastic product. How does Philips, a much smaller company, do it so much better? In the interim, I'll keep using SmartThings, but I really have reservations recommending it to anyone due to how lousy the software is."}

However, the automation routines still need a lot more works (customization) for the hub to be great device.\n\nFor one thing, the automation routines allow many customization rules to be configured. However, the rules fall short of one very simple logic and that is the duration of the \"on\" state for a device. For example, you can create an automation routine for disarming the alarm and turning on a light when someone arrives between 7PM and 10PM at night, but you cannot configure the light to stay on for a certain amount of time before the routine turns the light off. If I only want the light the be on for 5 minutes when I arrive, I cannot create a routine for this. You can only create a routine for turning things on and turning things off, but you cannot create a routine for turning things on for a certain amount of time. Some people may ask why don't I just create a routing to turn off the light? My answer would be \"yes, I could!\" but since I don't know what time I'll be arriving, I can't create a routine to turn the light off if I don't know what time the time will be turned on.\n\nThere are other simple and logical settings that are totally missing from the configurations. This is not a hard fix, so hopefully someone with a common sense would fix it in the next software update."}

Otherwise it never sees it.) The smartthings app on android is also very handy. It has widgets you can add to your home screen to perform various routines, and you can also setup your phone as a presence sensor and create routines based on it's presence. In my case, I use it to unlock my front door and turn on the living room light as soon as my phone is detected by the hub. The only flaw with this routine, is it runs the routine if I reboot my phone while within range of the hub, so I have to remember to lock it back again when I reboot.

It's not OK if you can't get a reading from the sensor.\n2) Becomes unresponsive and you have to open the device and pull the batteries to get it back online. The app doesn't alert you that the hub is offline either which isn't ok.\n3) Some of the automations have just stopped running and the only way to get them to start running again was to go in and re-save them.\nThese have made this experience of using this frustrating and you can't rely on things to work. You shouldn't have to go in every day and check the application logs to make sure it's all working properly."}

Even the past 9 months has been sketchy.\n\nBecause you hear complaints first out of these reviews, I will start there first.\n- Connectivity issues: From no notifications, to failed communication to batteries needing to be replaced frequently.\n- Outages: There are quite a few outages that occur, while they don't affect me that from what I know, there are frequent and concerning\n- Samsung purchase: It seems since the Samsung purchase of the company, the software has taken a dive.\n- Product support: It's been slower to non-existent and some features I would expect to see, haven't happened yet.\n\nWhat is the good?\n- My hub works most of the time: This is good, specifically when it comes to safety, Z-wave smoke alarms, etc.\n- Apps/Interface: While not the best, it's pretty good and somewhat easy to use.\n\nIt's unfortunate, good luck to those who want to venture into the unknown. I hope they get their stuff together. I won't replace SmartThings until I can get another Z-Wave hub in place, for now, it's staying here but not for long."}

The door opener still has issues but that is not an function of the Smartthings its because that device was poorly built.\n\nDiscovery: It discovered all my Hue Bridge devices almost immediatly after I plugged the unit in (I had to do a little more than that but it was that simple).\n\nApp: The app is decent, I would like a nice browser interface but I can live with the app. It works as needed and is simple for most users.\n\nAutomation: It needs a little work in the Scene/automation section while I can create Automation schedules I would like a bit more control over complicated scheduling, but that is why I have the other controller.\n\nThe one thing I really like is that even though it wont discover some older Z-wave devices I have (neither did my Fibaro), my Vera can see them, and I can group the Devices from the Vera and the Fibaro together and control them from the Hub.

After returning home several trips ago to find water on the floor from a broken refrigerator ice maker line, I decided to install some leak detectors so I could monitor any water leaks. Two weeks of having a professional service dry my hardwood floors was enough motivation. I had already set-up Arlo home security cameras and Nest smoke detectors for web-based monitoring. So doing the same with leak detectors made sense.\n\nAfter researching leak detectors, I decided on the ones offered by SmartThings. I liked the small size and the fact there were no wires or electric plugs involved. I installed them and was very happy with how they worked, though it did take some tinkering.\n\nThen I discovered a serious limitation. Samsung SmartThings does NOT provide a web-monitoring portal, like I'm used to with Arlo or Nest. Instead, I am forced to monitor only through my Android phone. This isn't a problem except when I am traveling internationally where I use a local throwaway phone. Of course, that's why I got the detectors to start with, because of my travel. Not being able to monitor by web internationally is a problem.. If I had known, I would have kept looking.\n\nI confirmed this \"no web-based monitoring\" limitation with Samsung SmartThings customer support. That's correct-no web-based monitoring, they said, but web-based monitoring is not common for home device monitoring (I'm always uplifted to have a company tell me that my needs are not legitimate in order to justify a problematic product design). But I have Arlo and Nest, I said, both of which provide web-based monitoring. True, they said, but they are not complete smart home solutions. (So what? I'm thinking) According to the rep, there are no plans by Samsung SmartThings to provide web-based monitoring.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't research well enough to uncover this limitation. I'm posting this review just in case it helps someone else avoid a similar mistake."}

Recording for 10 seconds isn't useful and therefore I'm no longer using SmartThings as I'd hoped. Maybe it works well for other things but this was one of the \"out of the box\" products that it claims to work with and not doing so was a deal breaker for my needs. Also as an FYI, it still requires you to keep all the hubs and product specific accounts to use the SmartThings hub, so it doesn't replace all of that, rather it just \"controls\" the devices with which it's compatible. I didn't know this and while not a terrible thing, wanted to mention for others to know in advance. Hope this helps."}

My wife and I live in a large three-story townhome. I have 2 Wi-Fi (802.11 n/ac) access points \u2013 one that came with my Verizon FiOS in the basement and a TP-Link Archer C9 in a bedroom on the top floor. I have an Echo on the middle floor and an Echo Dot in the basement and on the top floor. The \u201cHub\u201d is connected to a wired Ethernet local area network.\nI am in the process of replacing an ancient (predates the dinosaurs) homegrown Elk security system that has no chance of incorporating home automation. I decided to dive headlong into security/automation products. I wanted a complete all-in-one answer rather than one system for security and one system for automation. I also wanted Alexa and IFTTT integration. Enter the \u201cHub\u201d. Perfect.\nTo test the system before replacing all the old security sensors, I purchased several products \u2013 all Z-Wave Plus: Leviton Switch DZ15S, Leviton Dimmer DZ6HD, Leviton Plug-In Outlet DZPA1, Ecolink Motion Sensor with Pet Immunity PIR-ZWAVE2.5-ECO, Ecolink Door/Window Sensor DW-ZWAVE2.5. The Ecolink Door/Window sensors are large. I actually tried several other smaller sensors to no avail.\nEvery one of the devices connected with absolutely no issues.\nThe \u201cHub\u201d software and the integration with Alexa are working perfectly. I have geo-fencing set up so that when either my Android phone or my wife\u2019s iPhone leave the house or return, the system sends both a text and push notification. I can turn on all the lights when I park the car in front of the house. My front porch lights go on at sunset and off at sunrise \u2013 simple setup using the Smart Lights capability. When my wife walks upstairs to the bedroom, a simple \u201cAlexa, turn on the bedroom light\u201d and the light is on. I have not yet tried to set up scenes or rooms but I suspect that will be easy.\nReady for this? There are two apps on the Windows 10 Store \u2013 Home Remote and SmartThings To Start \u2013 that give you access to the devices while sitting at a PC. The SmartThings app on Android, the iPhone and iPad is very easy with a simple interface. You can even put your favorites on the lock screen.\nThe SmartThings app development is open-source. That means you can code your own apps if you are so inclined to try it. To code a smart app you use a derivative of the Java programming language name Groovy (and yes, Groovy is groovy, an easier and more concise language than Java but runs in a Java Virtual Machine).\nThere is also IFTTT if you want to code various actions based on events.\nSo, only a month into my testing, no problems. I am constantly opening and closing doors and windows, walking by the motion detector and giving Alexa a workout turning lights on and off or changing the dimming.\nThe Ecolink devices use the CR123A battery and all devices after a month still show 100%. The Ecolink devices report their battery level to the \u201cHub\u201d.\nMy house is well covered by two Wi-Fi access points. The Z-Wave Plus devices act in a mesh network and so far no problem with devices not being detected. I would strongly recommend going with Z-Wave Plus devices as the coverage is better with less power draw than the original Z-Wave.\nFor those adventurous souls, there are several tutorials online about coding a SmartThings app using Groovy. One sample has you code an app to turn on a light if motion is detected.\nBy the way, some window/door sensors (the Fibaro and Nortek GoControl for example), are not detected as a window/door sensor but rather as a switch. They report an activity when an event happens (open or close) but do not show the current status (open or closed).\nAnd now for the security part. SmartThings has paired with Scout Alarm for professional monitoring. This solves my requirement for one system to handle security and home automation. There is no additional hardware nor contract required to utilize Scout. You can pay my month or yearly at a discount.\nI expect to continue testing for several more months before I undertake a complete removal of the old security hardware. I will update this review as my testing proceeds.\nAll in all, Groovy!"}

{"Author": "A. Magill", "Date": "on July 13, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Miserable", "Text": "I was disappointed. Looking into this beforehand, it seemed aimed directly at my nerdy engineer heart. It's programmable with a well-documented language and API, it supports loads of third-party devices, and it's supposed to have enough of its own brains to work mostly independent of the cloud. I couldn't wait to start getting stuff hooked up to it.\n\nOnce I had it in hand, though, I was almost immediately frustrated and disappointed.\n\nActually getting devices to pair with it was a strangely major struggle. Following the normal instructions (didn't work), then the troubleshooting instructions (didn't work), then suggestions from around the internet, actually getting a device to pair took around an hour. This happened with all three devices I got (a dimmer plug, a dimmer switch, and a deadbolt, all different brands). Even then, communication was unreliable, had poor range, and often took several seconds to respond. At one point, I had somehow apparently paired a device twice at once- before it wasn't connected at all, and then suddenly there were two entries for it. Now they also make it surprisingly annoying to un-pair a device- you have to get the device to request that it be un-paired. But that only made my duplicate pairing situation worse, not better- it removed the working pairing, but left behind the one that didn't. So I had a device listed in the app with no apparent way of removing it. I finally found out if I go through a certain web site, there are advanced controls to just delete a device, and that fixed it.\n\nI found the Android app to be pretty annoying, the web site kind of terrible, and the Windows application that's advertised on the product page simply does not exist.\n\nAnother thing I was unhappy about was that it's absolutely dependent on the Cloud to function. Not even just for weather updates or for communicating with you from outside the house or that kind of thing, but for everything. Even if you write your own programs to control your devices, sometimes they might run locally on the hub, sometimes they might run on Samsung's servers and tell the hub what to do. There's no way to know or control that decision. So if you lose internet access, maybe your light switch stops working too.\n\nI've seen IoT-type devices done right. It's rare, but it happens. My RainMachine sprinkler timer, for example, is just about a perfect example of getting the technical details right. With this is looks like the developers set out with some great ideas, but then something went terribly wrong with the implementation. I have literally myself programmed electronic devices to be able to discover and communicate with each other wirelessly, and I'm baffled by how poorly the SmartThings hub does it. I've returned all of my Z-wave stuff."}

The recent addition of Scenes to ST only brings it up to the level of other hubs like Vera. I dumped my expensive Vera hub directly for the reason of lack of a Rules Based Engine solution. The whole purpose of automation is that I don't have to be the brain to drive the system (push a button). I want a system that will look at the environment and on specific events (i.e. motion sensor = active then open multiple vents and turn on Fans & A/C, else close the vents and turn off the fans & A/C) and make decisions without further interaction on my part.\n\nScenes and routines require for me to decide it time for an action and press a button to make it work.

It was absolutely worthless with the Schlage Z Wave connect lock and I may as well have not purchased it at all, I had the same minimal functionality - to lock and unlock. For my other systems it was not as capable as the apps I already my phone that are connected to my wifi. We spent 4 hours trying to figure out how to do a developer app and finally just gave up.

Likewise with the Good Night heat setting. I've had to lower the heat manually. Most of the time it seems to work, but I'd guess that 10% of the time it doesn't.\n\nI bought this set up instead of a programmable thermostat. The programmable thermostat I had in my last house never failed. This one fails 10% of the time.\n\nI don't know if the Hub sends a signal and it's ignored or if it misses sending a signal, but either way, sometimes the program settings don't happen.\n\nIt is easy to set up or I'd rate it lower. But, it needs a way of checking to make sure the programmed changes take place. Now I'll worry when I leave on vacation about whether it will work."}

As others have found, the activation code just did not work, failing time and again. Only after a hard rest could I get it to fire up. While I was happy to persevere, I'm not sure everyone would be as patient and would simply return for the refund. Samsung need to review this.\n\nIf you're dipping your toe into smart home technology, this hub is a good starting point.

People will sometimes give a poor review to some piece of equipment or software stating \"it didn't work correctly,\" often without realizing \"operator failure\" to be the cause. That said...since this product has such mixed reviews, I decided to test it out primarily because of its ability to integrate with Amazon Alexa, Harmony Smart Hub, Schlage Keyless Entry, Linear Garage Doors and most importantly all of the Z-Wave outlets and switches throughout my home. The basic hub setup was relatively painless except for having to \"unpair\" each of the above items from the existing Z-Wave controller in order to then pair it with the SmartThings Hub. Once that tedious task is complete then you must set up each of your automations not only on the ST Hub but also with any controllers such as Alexa and Harmony. Depending on how many products you have to pair, this process can be fairly labor intensive. Once I completed the pairing processing it was time to set \"automations\". Here's where my issues began. Paired items either wouldn't operate or operated intermittently. My AV equipment and TV would turn on every morning between 10:45 am and 11 am. When requesting that Alexa perform certain functions she'd attempt to perform the action, however the item or items did not respond to her commands. After a week of unnecessary frustration, I was ready to return the Hub until I saw there was a \"major update\" on the horizon. I decided to hold off on returning the equipment until after the update in the event there was some \"WOW Factor\" improvements. Well folks, I'll close this review by saying, the only WOW factor with this product for me is \"WOW I can't believe I bought it!\""}

CONS FIRST: This device is not yet ready for market and every item purchased which is listed as compatible on the app have not worked as advertised. EXAMPLES 1. None of the battery powered wall mounted dimming switches will actually adjust light brightness. On and off is the only option from the wall switch. Dimming can only be done with the phone app. 2. SONOS owners beware-every time you use the app to search for a new device (thing), your SONOS speakers are hijacked and their operation from your SONOS controller is compromised. Even after you remove the SONSO speakers (1 at a time) from the app they are wonky for a a few hours. Samsung phone tech support says this is a known issue with no fix in the pipeline. 3. Tech support relies heavily on the online user groups for help. They even sent me there because they had no answer. This is fine if you want SMARTTHINGS as a hobby. Geek out if you want. If you want an easily installed, stable and reliable smarthome system, this is not for you. Bear in mind, I am a bit of a geek, but when it comes to something the rest of the family has to use, I want it to be simple and bullet proof. SMARTHINGS is neither. 4. SAMSUNG's compatibility list is outright false advertising. 5. If your idea of a smarthome is controlling everything with the SMARTHINGS app, you may be fairly satisfied with this device. If you want wall switches and remotes to also control your home (you know, walk into a room and use a dimmer on the wall to control lights like cavemen did) this thing stinks. 6. Do not use Amazon's frequently-bought-together guidelines for compatability. Even SAMSUNG tech support said that is giving them headaches. PRO LAST: 1. Very attractive 2. Built in battery backup 3. Small footprint. 4. No range issues in a 4,000 3 floor home 5. No port forwarding required yet 6. Easy initial installation except for the SONOS problem. Devices (things as samsung calls them) install easily (but many advertised features are simply not available. There are cheats for this on the message boards sometimes, but that's a pain in the butt). TO CONCLUDE: I had high hopes for this device, which are in the crapper. I am so close to returning it and all devices I have bought for it. The only thing stopping me is the huge amount of time I have into troubleshooting. SAMSUNG tech support even sent me a $50 Amazon gift card for all my troubles. Their phone log for me goes on for hours. I know networks and tech better than most and I am very frustrated. I would not buy it again and I obviously do not recommend this product."}

{"Author": "Rodney McKay", "Date": "on May 19, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Painfully unreliable with Alexa", "Text": "Actually, it's not that I don't like SmartThings (or Alexa/Echo), is just that the two of them are an extremely frustrating combination. The problem is, the Alexa app's \"Discover Devices\" way too often fails to work with devices that are registered (and working perfectly) with SmartThings. If you search online, you'll find all sorts of \"tricks\" for getting around this well-known problem, mostly involving removing the devices from SmartThings, reinstalling them, and then running Alexa's Discover Devices again. Doesn't work.\n\nThis came up for me again recently because I wanted to rename a light switch that had been working fine with SmartThings and Alexa. So, following the directions, I removed the device from Alexa's list, renamed it in SmartThings, and tried to get Alexa to re-Discover it. No go! I also tried removing it in SmartThings and reinstalling it in both, and that didn't work either. I've been working on it for a week now, and am tearing my hair out with frustration.\n\nSo, I would say that using Alexa and SmartThings together is something to take on only if you have an unusual amount of patience and significant technical savvy. And by the way, it's also well known that this is a problem with SmartThings rather than with Alexa's Discover Devices. So, if you're addicted to Alexa (I am!), you might want to consider a home control solution other than SmartThings.\n\nEdit, May 29, 2017:\n\nAfter a week of useless discussions with SmartThings tech support, and many more hours of wasted time, I have given up and switched to using a Wink Hub 2. So far, it has NONE of the problems that I've been having with SmartThings. It is very easy to add devices to Wink, and they quickly & easily appear in the Alexa app when I run the device discovery. Why can't SmartThings fix this absurd problem that so many users are having?! As it is, Alexa and Wink are a wonderful combination, but SmartThings with Alexa is a very masochistic experience.\n\nThe one problem I can see with Wink compared to SmartThings is that the Wink hub does not have battery backup. This is a really bad decision on the part of the Wink developers (especially since Wink doesn't always reset itself correctly after a power failure), but a simple workaround is to plug the hub into an inexpensive uninterruptable power supply (UPS). The hub draws very little power, so even the smallest UPS can keep it running for a long time.\n\nI'll edit again if the SmartThings problems get fixed (I'm not holding my breath...) or if I run into trouble with Wink, but so far I'm a very happy camper with Wink and Alexa.\n\nFor all the time I've wasted on SmartThings, I could have manually operated the devices I'm trying to use with it thousands of times. What's the point of home automation if it costs you far more time & effort (and money...) than it saves?"}

I bought 5 years ago an entire Insteon but never implemented it so I sold it all off on ebay. It was one of the premier systems but closed in terms of standards they supported at the time. Then about 2 Years ago I got the Samsung SmarThings hub to do 2 things\n1) Create a garage door opener that I can control from my iPhone\n2) Install and control Schlage Connect BE468 Touchscreen Deadbolt At Schlage smart lock\nI created a kludge for garage door opener based upon HSM200 and I posted in the SmartThings forum how I got all that to work\n\nI did not want to pay any subscription fees. I also liked that SmartThings worked with all standards such as z-wave and zigbee. So that is what I liked about the SmartThings platform and the Schlage lock and garage door \"hack\" I put together. Now to enhance the Schlage smart lock I bought a few \"Smartapps\" from rboy (google \" rboy apps SmartThings\" as amazon won't let me put the link here) These have been a godsend. For a small one-time fee (I think $35 - I can't remember but this gets me lifetime access to all of the apps here) I got this app\nUser Unlock/Lock Door Notifications and Actions\nwhich sends me texts and let me know which code was used to unlock my door, I also get a notification and history in my app.\n\nAnd just this past week I worked their support to figure out a minor issue that annoyed me. In summary my smart lock was sending a note every minute that the \"Code 1 is Not Set\" \"Code 3 Is Not Set\" etc. I suspected this was draining my batteries in my smart lock.\nThe support from rboy apps had me install a new \"device handler\" for my smart lock vs. the generic one. Think of a device handler as software driver for the smart lock. This was very easy to do and it solved my issue of the notifications occurring every minute and battery drain has been greatly reduced. I also got some new nifty features such as disable the keypad from my phone (also known as vacation mode).\nFYI I changed from \u201cZ-Wave Lock\u201d to \"Enhanced z wave Handler\u201d for the device handler. Instructions for this are very clear on rboy's site.\n\nThe only thing out of the ordinary is that you can't just install these enhanced smartapps from your phone, you need to create an account on the SmartThings ide webpage (google \"SmartThings ide\") and on this web page install the\napp. It is not hard at all.\n\nOverall I'm very happy, I also bought a few switches that allows me to turn on a fan while I'm cycling indoors from my phone. I tried to put in smartphone enabled lights from GE but my house did not have a neutral wire to allow this (my house is 30 years old).\n\nI also can control my sonos which may seem pointless but if am away I can put music on to look like I am home.\nI also bought as GE smartbulb and when I go away I turn that lamp on with this bulb and then schedule the light to turn on and off at various times to make it look like I am home."}

Shulman", "Date": "on May 10, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great product at a great price!", "Text": "Having just moved into a new home, I was looking at putting in some sort of DIY alarm system. I paid far more then I'd like to think about using ADP in our last place. I looked at other competitors and ultimately decided on this due to it supporting a lot more devices then the competition.\n\nI've had it up and running for 2 weeks and it's been great. I have over 20 devices monitored and so far it was worked flawlessly. Another big plus for me was that they have a windows phone app. Using a windows phone, this has been great. My only complaint about that is that the app isn't consistent with the android app (I also have a couple android devices). I can do all the same things, but how you get to some things varies a bit.\n\nWhile I gave it 5 stars, because I do love it, there are some things that a casual user might find more frustrating. A number of newer sensors and zwave devices don't work with it out of the box. But there is a great community behind smartthings and every device I've purchased that didn't work out of the box is working with it. You just need to manually install a custom device handler for these devices - do a search and you will easily find plenty of info on this and it isn't that difficult to do. There's also a lot of smartapps and it seems people are always working on more. I know over time, this will just keep getting better.\n\nSo if you are looking for a DIY system that can not only provide alarm type features (siren, door/windows sensors and motion sensors and alerting via the app or even via text message) but also home automation features such as turning on lights when you enter a room, or turning them off after a certain time..etc. Then this is a great device! I've even used smart switches on our outside lights to turn them on at sunset and off at a specific time. Much more flexible then a standard timer!\n\nIn summary: I'd highly recommend it! With one caveat - If you don't have a neutral wire in your light switches, you will NOT be able to use smart switches - but there's plenty of work around's for this."}

Well It could not have been one without this Smartthings hub. It's essentially the intermediary between your devices and Alexa. Sure theres a lot of devices now that says works with Alexa and such, but having this hub can run all the devices through it, and then Alexa. It enables you to create rooms with ALL the different devices even from different companies, and make them work together. This enables you to incorporate many diifferent products and control them from one place. I have at least 8 ifferent brands of product running through this hub, and It. also. works well integrated with IFTTT. You can also create your own automations through this hub, like I have the lights turn on in the morning to wake me up. It even recognizes Belkin WeeMo Smart Bulbs when the weemo app won't. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to start a smarthome because it is so versatile. It's easy for beginners because of the interface, an that you can control most all of your devices that are wifi, z-wave, or Zigbee thst are within range. Most products mention whether or not they work with this hub, and most do. I think I have over 100 devices going through SmartThings now, and Alexa Integrates right with Smartthings so you can use your voice to control everything. Sometimes it even finds devices for you. I included a few pics of the interface on the app on my Iphone7. I would highly recommend getting one for your smarthome, so you can bring everything together. It's the best hub on the market in my opinion right now."}

There is no \"figuring this out\". It's buggy and has many known issues. I've had this hub since it was released.\n\nIf you have 5-10 devices, you're fine. You probably won't see most of the issues I've been dealing with. It's when you replace all your home light switches, garage doors, and dead bolts that you see the many issues.\n\nI have 153 devices on my z-wave network. WELL under the 240 that this system is advertised to support. None the less, SmartThings support continues to blame \"Z-wave network traffic\" as the culprit.\n\nThe issues include:\n- Devises no longer responding to commands from the app.\n- Light switches just reverse direction (down makes the light turn on, up makes the light turn off)\n- Blue LED notifications just flip (Set to glow when the light is on, but glows when the light is off)\n- Randomly, triggers such as outside lights will work and will not work\n- System will just NOT respond to a light on/off command or be delayed 30+ seconds.\n\nThese issues aren't few and far between. They are a daily occurrence. When a random switch stops working with the app you have to remove it from the hub and add it back in. This sounds easy but it's flaky and frustrating like the rest of this system. Sometimes you can remove it, sometimes you have to spend 10 minutes unregistering it 5+ times. To makes matters worse, it randomly will unregister other switches instead, exacerbating the problem.\n\nThen you need to add it. This is another frustrating 10+ minute project. It will add the switch incorrectly (which means you need to remove it and add it again), it'll actually have not unregistered it (despite telling you it did) so you have to go back in and unregister it again, or it'll just not find it.\n\nI love the possibilities of this system and what it can do. These problems completely kill the experience. There is no fix for these problems. I had them in hub 1 and continue to have them in hub 2. Support is worthless as they give you the same canned response. \"Pull the power toggle on the switch\", \"Power cycle the hub\", \"Remove the device and readd it\". If you only want 10 or so smart devices, get this! If not prepare to be unbelievably irritated."}

Adding \"things\" to the HUB was pretty simple as well... my main issue there had to do with the \"things\" I was installing, not the HUB. So far the device has functioned exactly how I thought it would and and I am very happy with it."}

The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because setting up smart routines is not as simple or intuitive as it could be. I also have trouble getting the hub to recognize when my wife and my phones arrive and leave. At least I don't think it does. When I look at the history I can often see them leaving but not arriving. How does it know it left if it doesn't show me that it arrived prior to that. It could just be a quirk in the app. I don't feel like I can depend on smart routines that depend on the phones leaving or arriving because of that.\n\nI also wish they had a desktop app for controlling the hub and devices. There are some things that would just be much easier configuring on a larg screen instead of on a phone screen.\n\nI have no complaints about reliability or up-time. I also have almost no trouble with coverage. I did have an issue setting up connected Cree bulbs outside of the house. I had to get the hub to recognize them inside the house because it couldn't detect them outside. Then I moved them outside and they are controlled with a smart routine or through Alexa with no problems. Weird that you can't set them up outside but there is no problem controlling them. I guess it is the brick walls causing the problem because they are no further from my hub than other devices in the house.\n\nI had some issues re-syncing the devices when I moved into a new house but eventually was able to work those issues out by removing the skill from Alexa and adding it back in. Until I did that, Alexa had all of my old device names showing as offline as well as all of my new device names. It was mostly annoying and I don't know if that could be considered any SmartThings problem or not.\n\nI have been able to connect every device that SmartThings said it would connect. I had trouble getting a connected switch to work again after I moved it but after I quit trying to remove it from ST and just renamed it instead, everything was good."}

I have had problems connecting with it when I have spotty cell phone service, but that is to be expected. Also, it does need to be within a reasonable proximity of the switches and outlets that it is controlling. I did have problems with connecting to a switch after the initial set up, but they were resolved when I moved the hub closer.\n\nThe options for interfacing with the Honeywell thermostats leave much to be desired. It seems like you can't change the schedule or make temporary temperature changes on the thermostat, but only permanent temperature changes. I only use the Honeywell app for adjusting my thermostats.\n\nThe biggest complaint that I have with this hub is that it loses connectivity several times per day. It seems to regain connectivity right away, but when it loses it, it causes a rapid flashing blue light on my phone which is annoying to see flash during the night. I have tried moving it in different places along with the router it is connected to, but this issue doesn't go away.\n\n**EDIT: After speaking with a rep from Smartthings, I have learned the connectivity issue that I've been having is with the Honeywell connectivity. It is still a Smartthings issue and not a Honeywell issue and they are supposed to be working on a fix for it. I will update my review accordingly once the fix has been applied."}

The hub communicates with \"Z-Wave\" which is a very common communication between automation devices. Z-Wave is the only maker I have found for 3-way light switches. The hub will control many other devices such as bulbs, locks, switches, dimmers, sensors and more. I control the device through an app on my phone.\n\nPros: Works with universal Z-Wave technology. It can control 50+different devices. If placed in a central location has good range for my bedrooms. Takes only one TCPIP address. Other type of devices each take an address and communicate individually on the internet. Works both with Google and Amazon. Devices purchased for this hub cost generally less than those that talk directly to the internet. My guess they are simpler. The service that talks to Amazon and Google is free. Some have additional charges. This does not.\n\nCons: It will only control \"Z-wave\" compatible devices. I haven't found this much of a problem as more devices are being released all the time. Devices using this hub have limited intelligence. All the smarts is in the hub and the App from Samsung. Although the app is good, it does have some limitations. I have not found many."}

It also fails to turn on lights in scheduled routines where my original Wink hub never failed. It will tell you a light is on in a routine that is absolutely not on. It's also way slower than the original Wink hub for turning dimmers on and off. I'm ordering the Wink 2 and putting this upgrade in the trash bin."}

Having been an early adopter of the Wink system, I was OK with the Wink Hub itself but always a bit disappointed with the Wink mobile app with respect to it being very basic/limited (in fact, while many of my home automation devices are connected to my network via my Wink Hub, I most always use the mobile apps from the manufacturers of the various home automation devices instead of using the Wink mobile app - especially the Honeywell Thermostat mobile app, as its 10x better than the Wink interface). In addition, or so I thought, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of devices available/compatible with my Wink Hub. As Wink recently rolled out its next-gen hub, I did a little research about the current other available hubs on the market (e.g. Nest, etc.) and from the reviews I read, it seemed as if the 2nd Gen Samsung SmartThings Hub offered everything I was looking for that I thought was lacking with respect to my Wink hub (and instead of upgrading to the 2nd Gen Wink Hub, I would simply upgrade to the Samsung hub as it was about the same price). Wow, did I make a terrible mistake.\n\nAs an initial matter, my research was correct with respect to the Samsung SmartThings Hub having a much better mobile app and having a lot more to offer than my original Wink Hub. However, as I quickly realized, the Samsung Hub was basically worthless to me as it is not backwards compatible with most all devices and in order to utilize same, you will need to upgrade all of your existing home automation devices to newest version of same (and even then, the devices available for the Samsung Hub are very limited, much more so than my old Wink Hub). For example, one of the home automation devices I currently utilize is the SkyBell video door bell (which I found was far superior to its more expensive competitors). Unfortunately, when I attempted to link my SkyBell device to my new Samsung Hub, I quickly discovered that the Samsung Hub will only work with the newest HD version of the SkyBell video doorbell (and which is 2x the cost of the original SkyBell device that works just perfectly).\n\nI could go on and on, especially with respect to the cameras supported by the 2nd Gen Samsung Hub. Speaking of cameras, if you desire to link cameras to this Samsung Hub, you will need to get your checkbook out as all, not just a few, but all of your existing cameras will not work with the 2nd Gen Samsung SmartThings Hub. If money is not an object, than you will have an excuse to upgrade all of your home automation devices if you purchase the new Samsung Hub (and on a side note, you will be better off keeping your cameras separate from your hub and investing in some quality POE IP Cameras - trust me).\n\nAs I have missed the return deadline, I basically have a $100 plastic box that does absolutely nothing. As pride myself on being an Amazon/eBay Buyer, and only a \"buyer,\" selling this worthless device is not an option so I have relegated myself to keep my new Samsung SmartThings Hub, for the next couple of years, in the back of my basement, by my server rack (with the hope that someday down the road, I will just happen to purchase some odd home automation device that will only work with this fancy new Samsung SmartThings Hub - so as to justify me throwing away $100 on it). If anything, I am keeping it as a reminder for me to be more diligent in my research when purchasing such devices (e.g. making sure that when the product says it supports a device, such as a SkyBell doorbell, I confirm that it supports the specific make/model of device I am looking to connect to it).\n\nLast but not least, I did end up purchasing the new 2nd-Gen Wink Hub and I could not be more pleased with same (as the folks at Wink finally figured out that having an Ethernet port on the hub was one of those important things they should have thought of when they rolled out the 1st gen Wink Hub ----- I can only assume that the design team at Wink finally hired a few younger folks who know what a RoKu device is and how important it is to be able to link same via a hardwire network connection.\n\nI hope the foregoing assists you with your decision making process and, so that we are clear, the Samsung SmartThings Hub is a quality device and has a modern/updated mobile app to make using it easy. But as discussed above, should you elect to go with this device, get your checkbook out as you will be buying all new devices for your home automation needs!\n\nM"}

My hue lights work 99% of the time when triggered by smart things. Plain old z-wave wall switches work 95% of the time.

I had been looking to setup a 2nd z-wave network in my house for a few months and finally pulled the trigger. I already had ADT Pulse setup with many switches and cameras but wanted to put any new devices on SmartThings going forward. The other reason was ST (SmartThings) is Z-Wave PLUS and my first new switch was going to be about 80 feet from the house behind our pool. I felt I needed the Z-Wave Plus range and ADT does not support it.\n\nI bought the new GE Z-Wave Plus 14291 Switch and was able to pair it quickly. I did have a problem with the light only turning on fine but not turning off. I moved the ST hub to a closer location and removed and added the switch again but still could not turn GE switch off reliably. After 4 hours of playing with it I could not determine if the switch or the Hub was the issue (or just the range). I gave up for the night. The next morning I tried it and it worked perfect. I didn't change anything it just started working so all good now.\n\nI also bought the Aeon Labs Minimote\nhttp://amzn.to/2nk05PM\n\nI set this up to turn the light switch on and off. Setup took under 2 minutes and it also now acts as a simple remote control for the light switch. It is setup as a secondary controller for ST Hub for those looking to do same.\n\nI also setup the Amazon Echo ( http://amzn.to/2mgTd4W ) to respond to commands to turn the light on and off (\"Alexa turn on backyard light\"). That worked great too and setup was without any hiccups.\n\nI look forward to adding more devices to my ST setup and updating this review as my system grows."}

A bit confusing but understandable given the circumstance I suppose. As the hub maker, Samsung does have an undue burden managing all of the software and such when most of the device content in my house is from other companies. There are definately quirks.\nI installed lots of Z-wave smart switches (~15) throughout the house (mostly GE) but a couple of items from another maker.\nFast forward several months and several firmware updates, some of my automated routines quit working (specifically the sunrise sunset ones). So following advice from forums I removed my home \"location\". I didn't realize at the time that this would wipe out ALL of my switches that were set up. So I had to go through a complicated process of excluding each switch so that it could be detected and added again. I have one switch in a storage space under my patio with steel and concrete floor so that switch does not see the hub directly. It works once set up by using another switched plug adapter that I installed purely to act as a Z-wave repeater. I guess though that the repeater does not work during setup and device exclusion process. So I had to move my hub with a long ethernet cable to a place that it could see this switch.. In the process of all of this and holding my phone over my head so that it would connect to wifi in the house while I pressed the switch for the exclusion process I ended up dropping my new galaxy S8 phone and breaking the display glass. So thanks Samsung for that..\n\nUpdate: Today I got some email from support folks at Smartthings about my welcome code issue. I had already gotten past that issue but took the opportunity to clarify some other things and got great support from them. They were able to log into my account and see my devices and routines and find a little problem with one of them. (kinda creepy but helpful)!"}

I can no longer turn off or on lights with my phone or my Alexa.\n\nI work in IT as a network and server guy - I work all day with much more complicated hardware and software - but when I come home, I don't want to troubleshoot my home automation system and network - especially when the vendor broke it, not me.\n\nAfter contacting tech support, they tell me I might be able to get on a chat with them and they might be able to see what is going on with my SmartThings hub and maybe fix the device type issue BUT ... if that doesn't work, I'll have to delete all my bulbs and reconfigure my setup from scratch.\n\nI have hours upon hours of automations and timers setup. If I have to start over again, I'm going to buy the Wink 2 Hub and try my hand at that. Maybe it is more reliable."}

We have Alexa, Nest, Philips hue and Ge link bulbs, and ring video products.\n\nFrom our understanding Smartthings hub and app would be one device to rule them all so to speak and also allow the addition of other things such as door, and motion sensors etc. WE WAS WRONG!\n\nOne received i immediately removed my Hues &Ge from their bridge and disconnected it. I settled in for a day completely redoing everything through the Smartthings Hub and app. I hooked up the the Hub, downloaded the app, set up my account and the app began searching for my things. After several moments of not finding ANYTHING I was prompted to configure them manually. I began fumbling through the atrocious UI to little avail.\n\nI managed to get Ring Doorbell set up! But, its functionality with the hub and app was useless. No motion detection or video, and the only thing it would do is notify me when the doorbell was rang, pointless since the native app already does this and more.So I began searching their support site to only find out this Hub/app doesn't really do much. It wouldn't control my lights without their proprietary bridges or hub, a complete misrepresentation if I do say so myself. Nest wasn't supported either. In short this thing is really only good interacting with other hubs/apps with their sensors. We bought this thing to consolidate, not expand. I also learned a couple of other key things in my search, you will need to learn to code as well as set up additional accounts with coding platforms' such as Github.\n\nI broke down and called their customer service, who was less than enthusiastic about taking my call and answering my questions, and quite frankly rude. He also then told me that this was all my fault for not going to their website and fully reading ALL their forums on what and how things work before purchasing! I tried to explain that I bought the product on how it was advertised and I did go to their page to see what was supported, but more or less was told I was stupid for not understanding technology! Now, I'm not a genius but have greater than fair understanding of how things work. I have set up all these other things with no issues and integrated them with Ifttt. Plus I learned that they are cancelling their Windows app which means in a month or so I would not be able to use this anyhow as I only use Windows products.\n\nBottom line, if you want or need a bunch of sensors for tripping things like your lights then go ahead. But this really doesn't do anything your native apps can't do with IFTTT integration."}

After receiving my hub and setting it up (Very easy to do!) sadly, the SmartThings hub's optimum transmit range is limited to about 20-25 feet. This is great if you live in an apartment, but if you live in a house like I do, ALL of your switches, receptacles and controllers MUST be within a maximum of a 20-25 foot arc from the hub, otherwise they will not receive their signal from the hub and properly work!!!\n\nTech support was fantastic!!! You could not get better assistance! They know their product! After 2.5 hours chatting with them and using a 50 foot Ethernet cable to move the SmartThings hub closer to the light switches to pair them, we discovered that even after they were added to the hub and it was placed back in its place next to the router, the hub could not reach the wall switches to control them.\n\nIt appears that my only option now is to purchase a Z-Wave MESH Network Extender to see if that will work with the GE Z-Wave brand products. Perhaps the Z-Wave technology is also contributing to my challenge with the GE receptacles, switches, fan controllers and dimmers, which I purchased to work with my SmartThings hub. I do not know for sure...\n\nThere is no way that the SmartThings Hub can control a regular 'whole house' as depicted in their advertisements in combination with GE Z-Wave products. The idea is great, but unless the FCC or whomever allows them to goose up the transmit power of the hub to increase its range, it is limited to just a few rooms in your home which are closest to the hub."}

I connected to an Amazon Echo so I now have voice control over lights! Motion sensors work great most of the time, but get a little squirrely even now and them. Looking to add water leak sensors.

The system is a open system which allows you to add a very large number of third party devices and integrate them all together using one system. This is good for someone like me who has multiple systems but this mostly needs to be done though their Web Portal.

ST's first tier support team has been extremely pleasant but even the support agents admit that their engineering team is not taking the problem seriously.\n\nSeveral dozen of us on the community boards have pooled our resources, spent many hours (possibly dozens to hundreds when you add up all the time spent) and tracked the issue to ST cloud-based processing. The affected hubs are both v1 and v2 and are being used with multiple network router brands, so it is fairly easy to identify the issue being a cloud or firmware issue.\n\nThe group of users on the community forums have had no success in getting restarted and are moving away from the SmartThings platform because of the lack of interest in fixing the users with broken service. Support wants to send us new hubs, but spending 4 days of removing devices from the old one manually and then manually associating them with the new one and building back all the automation rules I have built up over the past year or so is not my idea of a fun weekend... and support acknowledges, there is no guarantee that will even work.\n\nThen, this week, ST publicly admitted to another recent firmware update adversely affecting batteries in a way that makes them leak all over the inside of the unit. I checked my batteries and found the same issue, so now I have a hub gets cut off from the cloud, with an alkaline mess all over the table it is sitting on.\n\nApparently there is not much interest in the engineering side of the house in responding quickly to these issues - and 7+ weeks without a home automation system that relies on the cloud is a very long time. Today I spent my day looking into other alternatives and am sad to have to say goodbye to SmartThings. The product was great while it worked."}

I've had it for about a year now. It connects to a crapload of things, which is great. There are two rather-significant downsides, though: You ABSOLUTELY WILL be required to spend a lot of time in frustration, figuring out the app, and its connection to the devices. You LIKELY WILL be required to occasionally delete and reconnect the devices. You should DEFINITELY NOT rely on SmartThings for anything that actually matters. Use it for remote control, but not automation. It's just not THAT reliable.\n\nI got this response SOME TIME AGO from SmartThings, but it looks like it was removed? and I really wanted to reply to it:\n\"SmartThings Support says:\nHello, Ellen with SmartThings support here.\nI'm very sorry to hear you've had these reliability problems using SmartThings. I'd definitely like the chance to look into these issues that keep popping up to make sure we're doing everything we can to help. I completely understand the frustration of devices or the app failing to work as expected and I want to be sure to look into those problems in detail. If you find that you often need to remove and reconnect a device over and over, it's very likely that the device is on the edge of the Hub's range or is being affected by interference. Sometimes one small change like moving your Hub to a raised and open area a few feet away from the Router will make a huge difference in how well your devices stay connected. I'd really like the chance to...\"\n\nAnyway, since then I finally bought a 50' cat5 cable and placed the hub in the middle of the house.

{"Author": "Adidas1976", "Date": "on January 12, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Excellent starting point for home integration", "Text": "I recently purchased this in November 2016 with the soul purpose of integrating my new Amazon Echo with it to voice control my house. My current set includes: Amazon echo in the kitchen, an Amazon dot in the playroom, an Amazon dot in our master bedroom, approaching 30 different GE Zwave and Zwave+ light switches/dimmers and add on switches (more on that later) and 3 HUE colored light bulbs (more on that later, as well).\nGoods:\n1. Pretty easy installation of the hub and app\n2. Easy recognition of newly installed z-wave devices\n3. Very active community board with multiple \"How-To's\" and FAQs on the smartthing website to help with products\n\nBad:\n1. The Hub is moderately priced, but buying devices to integrate into the hub is dang expensive\n2. Occasionally, does not always do what it is meant to do\n3. Hub has to be plugged directly into the router\n\nDownload the app (I have an iPhone 5). Plug in the hub and DIRECTLY CONNECT THE HUB TO THE ROUTER. This means that the hub has to be in close proximity of the router (I have the latest generation of Apple's AirPort, which hasn't changed in 5+ years). Follow the instructions on the app and you're up and running! I had no issues.\n\nIntegration goes like this: Purchase GE Zwave light switch, which runs between $35 an $40 a pop! There may be cheaper ones, but not by much. (I recommend staying with the same brand throughout your house. It makes it easier to trouble shoot later on.) Multiply that by how many switches you have in your house! But, you can do this one switch at a time. No need to do all of them all at once. Turn off breaker. Pull out old single switch. Connect the black line wire to the LINE connector on the zwave switch (this is the power coming into the switch box). Connect the black load wire to the LOAD connector on the new switch (this is the black wire coming from the light to power it). Now, these switches need to be connected to the white Neutral wire that is crumbled up in the back of the switch box. These switches come with a pliable extra white wire. Wire nut the whites together. Turn on the breaker and the blue LED light comes on that's on the switch. Test the switch manually to make sure that you can turn on and off the light. If the blue lights not on, you probably have the black wires switched. Open the app, tap on \"Add a Thing\", press up on the switch and the hub recognizes the new switch. Rename it and you're set.\n\nSounds complicated, but the hardwiring the switch is more complicated than integrating the new switch with the Hub. With the app, I have it set so when both my phone and my wife's phone break connection with our home wi-if, SmartThings turns off everything. (Have to always remember to remind the babysitter!)\n\nAmazon Echo has it's own app that needs to be integrated, but SmartThings has step by step instructions on that. Had no problem. Now I say, \"Alexa, turn off living room lights\" and all the lights in the living room turn off. Awesome!\n\nThe only problem I have had is with 3 way switches. This is where there are 2 or more switches doing the same light. When you pull out the switch on these bad boys, you'll be met with black, white and red wires. These are wired differently than normal 3 way switches. The way it is suppose to work is that there is one main zwave switch and an add on switch (which has no receiver). When you press the add on switch, it's suppose to turn off the lights AND send a signal to the main switch, to send a signal to the Hub, so that it registers as on/off on the app. I've had some of the newer zwave+ switches that do not register on the app. I.e., I turn off the light with the add on switch, but the app still says the light is on. Not a big deal, but it is annoying. This has only happened on the newer GE 14xxx Zwave switches with the older 12xxx add on switches.\n\nBesides this issue, everything has worked flawlessly. Other issues that have appeared are due to my figuring out complex 3 way switches that power multiple different lights. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone interested in an easy entry into home automation!"}

I also like that there are 3rd party apps such as Smartrules that work with the system allowing for more customization.

{"Author": "DRCNY", "Date": "on January 1, 2017", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "... to that company forcing us to upgrade to their worse version 2", "Text": "I bought this to replace my v1 version of Iris from Lowes due to that company forcing us to upgrade to their worse version 2.0. I was considering smart things and vera and landed on smart things. While it is NOT perfect, none of the main smart home hubs/systems are. There are things I like and things I don't like. Overall, it is easy to setup and connects to just about any z-wave or zigby devices. Compared to Iris/Lowes, there are at least online users groups who will help you figure things out (there is zero support for iris). There are some 'quirky' things I've noticed over the last year, one of them being that it is possible to have an action such as turn off/on a light based on a 'time' and if you later remove that, it still seems to be there. You typically can get around that by removing the device or even renaming it, but I had to learn this. It is not a 'big' negative and it literally is on one of my switches at this point. It also does not (or at least I cannot find) where you can see the strength of the connection to the hub of devices. This does come in handy for my devices that are in my backyard or to see if I need to add/move other devices to create a better 'mesh' of connectivity.\n\nBut, with those few negatives, overall it has worked well. It can be used as a basic system and as you get more into the smart home, you can do more things although I think if you are not overly techy you may struggle with some of the non-standard apps you can add. BUT, there are users online who do point you in the right direction.\n\nI also cannot speak to using it as a security system. I know some people require/want this, but for me I prefer to keep my smart home separate, perhaps someday that will change for me. I use it to control lighting, locks, thermostats, motion sensors and contact sensors to turn things on/off based on different times of day or even different days. I have contact sensors on my back door so for those days I may leave the door open, if it is more than a set number of minutes it will turn off the heat or AC until the door is shut. I use a motion sensor in my mailbox to text/alert me when mail arrives. So, you can get creative.\n\nIt does integrate with Amazon Alexa, so I can use voice commands to turn lights on/off or dim them, adjust thermostats.\n\nOverall, I\"m happy with it. I have not yet really used 'scenes' or 'geo fences' and may attempt those but they were never priorities. So, one must consider how advanced you want to be.\n\nOn the very big PLUS side compared to Iris, there is no monthly cost for features you will NEED. So, once you buy the hub there is no monthly cost. You will of course need to buy the 'things' (lights, switches, sensors, thermostats) that all work with the hub. I also feel that Samsung will continue to improve the product, whereas, I think Lowes will ultimately drop Iris especially after their change to version 2.0 which was a nightmare.\n\nSo do your research for what you want to use it for, but for me I've been happy with the system."}

A lot of progress has been made since I last used it. The smartthing developer web site has a lot of good information. Currently I have integrated; lights, home entertainment center, presence sensors, smart switches, lights, Sonos, and google home. Using both the mobile app and the web based development site (for creating virtual switches) I can create custom commands that google home can execute. I like the fact that smartthing integrates with a wide range of devices. You do have to be a bit of a techy for some of the more complex script developments.

I chose to buy the GE dimmable switches to connect to the hub and it was really easy to connect them. It really comes down to what you want to do. Buying a bunch of smart bulbs seems to be much more expensive. The GE switches cost about $32. I bought 14 of them and had someone come install them. Typically, I would install switches myself, but you have to connect a neutral wire, which for me meant I was going to have to cut a couple of wires. That was outside my comfort zone. I hired a handy man and he had them installed in about four hours.\n\nCurrently, I have it set up to where it recognizes when I leave the house and automatically turns off all the lights. It also recognizes when I get close to home and turns on all the lights. I also have an automation set up for when I watch movies so it turns off certain lights, turns on certain lights, and dims others to the level I chose while setting up the automation. There is so much you can do. It's going to take time to figure it out, but I like tinkering with things like this so I will enjoy it!\n\nThings to keep in mind: For three way switches where you can turn on lights from two locations, you will need the kit. Or, you can just install one switch and the other won't be able to turn the light on or off. I went with the second option for the moment. If you want to control fans, there are specific switches for that."}

Here are a few ways that I have leveraged the hub so far:\n- flood sensors in basement and near washing machine (IFTTT rule to text/email if water is detected)\n- Lamps - adding phone controlled dimmers, voice controlling with Alexa, auto scheduling\n- Outdoor string lights - voice controlled with alexa\n- Schlage Electronic locks - phone notification when door is unlocked, remotely locking/unlocking with phone, checking battery life, etc... would be nice to manage passwords but not currently supported\n\nPros:\n- Easy to setup hub\n- Easy to setup new devices\n- Easy to integrate with Alexa\n- Fairly dependable/reliable\n- Supports both Z-Wave and Zigbee\n\nCons:\n- The app is not very intuitive, rules are a paint to setup\n- As with most Samsung products, improvements/enhancements are pretty anemic\n- Many devices are still not supported\n- No widget support on Samsung/Android phones (this is shocking!)\n\nTips:\n- Make sure the device is high (e.g. on top of a table) and unobstructed- I had many issues when I kept the hub on a shelf in a bureau\n- Z-wave devices extend the range of your coverage area as they talk to each other, so if you have a switch far from the hub, try to add some connected devices between them\n- I would avoid WeMo devices as they always seem to have issues, stick with Leviton and GE for outlet dimmers\n- Seems to go on sale every few months - wait for a sale"}

Directions for doing so simply aren't very good, not because it's very complicated to do, but because the overall *theory* of how these things work is not conveyed to the amateur user. It was not clear until I was in the middle of installation that first of all, the hub should be installed into the main modem coming into the house and not a repeater, and that the first switch you install has to be within about 10 feet of the hub and not behind a wall. The devices (light switches, outlets, smart thermostat, etc.) all sort of link together into a network of their own, so the idea is that the first device is close to the hub, the next device has to be somewhat close to the first, the next somewhat close to one of the devices previously installed, and so forth. In other words, every smart device in your home is approximately 10-15 feet from at least one other device, and at least one of the devices is close to your hub.\n\nI hope that explanation makes sense to all the amateur installers out there! I had to google stuff and it was a little tricky because I didn't really \"get it\" for a while. But once I got it, it was a piece of cake.\n\nAnd everything works great -- I can run the lights from a mobile app or tell Alexa to turn them on/off/up/down, etc. The possibilities are endless!"}

You want a bit from this one, a bit from that one and so on. This one is pretty good and you can set it up as an easy & simple system, or as a complex techy version. Some devices from other makes and systems will work with it, (such as smart plugs) but whenever possible, get the samsung ones 'cos they just work better. Samsung use a protocol called Zigbee, but will also work within the Zwave system. Any device you add that is plugged into the mains (like a smart plug) will help to extend the network range.... But only for the protocol that it uses, so it's best to stick with one if you can. Here's a tip. Building up a good range is not as easy as just adding another plug, so you need to do some research and understand how it happens. With zigbee, get them paired with your hub, then place them around the house. Then, completely shut down the hub for at least 10 minutes, so that the plugs renew their connections with each other, therefore increasing the range. Then restart the hub. If you don't do this proceedure they all just carry on trying to communicate directly with the hub even if the signal is weak.\nThe system is pretty bomb proof and recovers easily from interruption of power or loss of internet connection. The current app that will control stuff works, it's useable, but isn't ideal. It's poorly thought out, often confusing, contains some minor bugs and is not a nice & easy \"flowing\" experience to use. The fact you can set up and control more than one system within the app is good and suits me as I need 2 systems. One system will replace British Gas \"safe & secure\", which was good but got neglected by BritishGas as they went off to do something else, so don't trust them with Hive!!! (Shame on you BG, you had loyal customers that you abandoned.)\nIf you have a failure of a component, dealing direct with Samsung is painfull. With me, one plug failed. I was back and fore with their customersupport for weeks sending emails, uploading videos to youtube, waiting for their agreement that it's faulty, returns notes, etc etc. I'm still waiting for the replacement. They don't see that I would not have requested a replacement if it was working..... Bad aftersales proceedure. Bad. I would not buy anything direct with them again. Use Amazon, or a local shop, or something.\nHowever. All in all, a good product. It works. I hope Samsung carry on developing it because it is almost superb!"}

My Emerson thermostat doesn't work with it. When you get this Hub it's a bit of a learning curve to start, but not too bad, adding the lifx bulbs was fairly easy. The rest of the devices were a little more difficult but not much. The Hub is basically a controller and there is no dashboard for your switches for Android or iPhone. That's disappointing but okay for me for the most part since I have the Amazon Echo. The built-in automation, or routines, is very basic, it does a lot less than IFTTT. Actually most of the functions on this are very basic, you can't even make groups. Any functionality beyond that is added through Community apps. So without custom Community apps it doesn't even do as much as the echo for the most part. Installing Community apps and device handlers is a much steeper learning curve. I found a community made device Handler that allows you to add lifx groups, like living room or patio, but the Hub often doesn't register their state correctly, so when you go to turn one off it will think it's off already. This happens often with all of the lifx bulbs, it doesn't pull their state correctly or often enough. If you want to make more complex automation like change my bulbs to daylight white during the day there is a community app called CoRE which is a rules engine. You can make really complex routines based off of all kinds of triggers, but it doesn't work half the time, and it's Community made so it's not like you can complain to anyone. My night mode routine is set to dim all the lights but one and turn off the TV through my Harmony Hub but it only works 50% of the time. It always worked on IFTTT. Actually one of the most reliable things this can do is trigger IFTTT commands but it's a pain to set up and the Echo already does that. I may be able to get it working after spending an additional 10 hours on community threads, but ultimately The Hub is just really disappointing and you are 100% reliant on community apps which may or may not be updated or maintained, or reliable."}

I've been tinkering with automation over the past two months with ST as my hub. Thus far I like it, but as with anything, there can be draw backs. Set-up is easy and prices are dropping on the hub as newer versions hit the market. I chose ST hub largely because of the field devices that are compatible with it. I worried about the merits of the hub communicating with devices in the farther reaches of my home, but it has handled things fine thus far. A few matters that prevent me from giving 5-stars being; once in a while, it logs me out of the app (iPhone). This becomes a pain while driving to get a quick glance of my home while at a stop light. This happens about once per week. The display of individual devices under the \"RECENTLY\" tab is hard to read ( I think because of the color of the font being used). It may not be the most user friendly platform, but it does perform a lot of cool functions. If you are somewhat tech savvy, you will like it. If you are not, it's still manageable. **Final note: hub MUST be within cable reach of your wireless router**\nPROS:\n> handles many field devices- look around, some great prices out there\n> Reasonable cost of hub\n> Small, compact\n> Range is good\n> New devices easy to add\n\nCONS:\n> Occasional log-outs\n> Device(s) fall asleep (rare)- need to be refreshed\n> Some fonts hard to read within app menus\n> TILES (PC app) is clunky and not very accurate\n> Wish it had more customization"}

When I purchased this, I expected to be able to set up an automation routine such as \"Set living room light brightness to 20%, set accent blooms to 50% and red, turn off dining room lights, turn on bathroom light to 100% and run \"Netflix\" routine on Harmony hub.\" Unfortunately, the overly simplistic rules engine of the Hub doesn't allow anything this complex.\n\nWithin the SmartThings environment, I can create an activity, select items to turn on, items to turn off, and a global brightness for the activity. I have no option to set colour of selected lamps in an activity, and while I can activate Harmony routines, it treats them as lightbulbs. The system is very rigid and inflexible, and is in need of an overhaul to even support simple \"watch a movie\" routines like the one I was trying to create.\n\nSmartThings uses a system of \"smartapps\" to integrate with other smart home items. I have to say that the Harmony, Hue, and Alexa apps tend to discover and add things more or less seamlessly, and the system tends to \"Just work\" as long as you aren't trying anything too complicated.\n\nSmartApps also attempt to replace some of the missing features in the rules engine. There's a SmartApp for changing lightbulb colour, but it has very specific conditions under which it can effect a colour change, but notably missing are triggers for a routine. Since routines have no way of altering the colour of a lightbulb, I'd expect to be able to use a smartapp to set light bulbs to change colour when that routine is run, as a sort of an attachment to it, but there is no way to link the two.\n\nOverall, when it works, it works, and it does do quite well for itself, within its limited scope. For now though, its usefulness is thoroughly hampered by the overly simplistic and rather confusing software. It is my hope that we'll see an update that improves the quality of the rules engine to allow for more complex routines, to make your home truly smart."}

So say you want to turn on a light? First you press a button then the hub sends the button request to a server over the internet which loads your code into memory if it isn't already there and then sends signals back to your hub. Sometimes this can take several seconds which of course is something you'll be happy with when you're turning a light on or off. When I got some new smart dimmer switches that were drastically affected by this absurd problem I did a lot of reading on the smart things community to find out that virtually nothing runs locally on the hub (that was the major selling point of the v2.0 hub,) I sent in a complaint to customer service and the response was that they hated to be the bearer of bad news but virtually nothing runs on the hub and they had no way of enabling some sort of developer mode that would let me do what I wanted with the hub I paid them money for. I don't know who designed the smart things architecture but they made a lot of ludicrous decisions which apparently the company is unable to fix."}

There is a relatively easy-to-use app for the phone. You can get going with this with relatively low effort.\n\n3) There is a very robust development community (discussion group, GitHub) that is terrific for those who want to extend SmartThings to do more through customized applications.\n\n4) Signal strength for wireless devices seems to be adequate. We are in a medium-sized ranch-style home with the hub at one end, and one of the wireless devices in the basement at the other end of the house works reliably.\n\n5) The platform reliability seems very solid. When the cloud network is going to go down for maintenance (once or twice in several years that i remember and always in the middle of the night US Central Time), you get advanced notice by email.\n\nPart of the fun is that SmartThings is extensible to other web applications throught IFTTT. For instance, I can say to Amazon's Alexa, \"Trigger Basement Off\" and Alexa will talk to IFTTT who will talk to SmartThings and boom, the basement lights go off.

I have sirens going off 60 seconds after the event that triggered them. I have doors being opened -- and the app (I've tried ios and android) not even recognizing it.\n\nI just got off the phone with Samsung support, no more than 20 minutes ago, and their support rep said this to me:\n\"...sometimes when we push out updates, we've found that you have to reset all of your sensors.\"\n\nNow, resetting a sensor involves one detaching it from the wall, removing the battery and repairing. I have over 20 sensors, and many are in locations that not easily accessible (i.e. 15 feet up).\nBeyond that, based on this rep's proclamation, the sensors can become inoperable (until the aforementioned reset) unbeknownst to me, and for no doing of my own -- simply because an update was pushed to the Hub.\n\nThis is terrible for the use that I THOUGHT it would work for: Home Security.\nImagine Samsung pushing out an update at 12am, and someone opening the garage door (which I've armed, mind you) at 1am. See where I'm going with this?\n\nI have nothing but terrible things to say about this product. It's lack of reliability elicited me to write this review.

I use my SmartThings hub primarily for lighting control and so far have 8 GE Z-Wave switches (also highly recommended), 2 Samsung leak detectors and a Schlage Camelot Deadbolt all controlled via SmartThings. I encountered a minor issue during setup and had to call Samsung support but they answered quickly and solved the problem within minutes. Since then, I have had no need of support. I use the Android App and it works well for my purposes. The service itself has been amazingly reliable and the switches work almost instantly. I have also had no issues adding new Things to my Z-Wave network. Its truly rare to find a product that outperforms expectation - this is definitely one of those products!!\n\nA word of advice though: I was in a rush to order the product and did not pay close attention to the details - I just knew that it was around $75. Well I mistakenly ordered it from a seller named 'Amaz247' and paid $100. I guess its a practice called Arbitrage where a seller is actually a middleman who just pockets a (large) portion of the profit and never actually has possession of the product. Avoid these sellers if possible. In the case of SmartThings, you can buy it directly from Amazon."}

Don't let the Samsung name tempt you... get something else", "Text": "UPDATE 5/5/2018\nI've had the device almost two years now, and it's seriously awful.\n\nOne update they pushed to the device caused it to respond incredibly slow. So while I was mashing \"on/off\" repeatedly and turning the brightness up and down, trying to get the thing to respond, little did I know I was actually queuing up commands that would then execute extremely slowly over the course of the next 30 minutes. So for the next 30 minutes, I watched as my bedroom light turned on and off and changed in brightness until the command queue finally cleared.\n\nI just updated to a new phone and tried to connect it to the hub. When I logged in, it didn't show the hub, so I tried to re-add it, and it said that the hub was already registered to another account. I tried to contact customer support, and first tried the \"live chat\" option, which ended up being a seriously stupid chat-bot that opened with \"I see you are interested in not-supported. Would you like some help with that?\". I then tried to e-mail customer support, and their home-automation products are not included in any of the REQUIRED \"product-type\" fields for obtaining support. I had to get connected to TV support to get a real person to tell me there's a specific number for \"smart things\" -\n520-441-3272. So I called the number and found out that the hub is associated with a different account. Smart Things actually has TWO mobile applications right now - one's a \"classic\" app. The new app logged me into my SAMSUNG account. So I have to download the CLASSIC app and can't use the newer app, and thus can't use any of the newer features. I also can't manage my current account until the \"migration\" happens, so anything I need to do, like reset my password, I have to call support. I seriously have wasted so much time just trying to log in, just to find out I need to use a different (older) version of the application. Everything about this application's design is terrible.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n------------------------\nI bought this because I generally love Samsung products. There's a lot of home automation stuff out there, and most of it fairly terrible or expensive (or both), so I was pretty excited and optimistic about this product. I could not have been more wrong.\n\nI have one light hooked up. Just one. And I have a light switch. When I press the light switch, I expect the light to turn on. When I click it again, I expect the light to turn off. Simple enough, right? Well when I press the switch, there's a 6-12 second delay between when I press the switch and when the light turns on / off. It's terribly annoying and I haven't found a way to change it. At first I thought it might be a communication problem between the hub and the devices, but I can activate / deactivate each device individually without issue, it's only when I use their \"Smart Lighting\" SmartApp (by Samsung) to trigger the light by the switch that it fails. I can turn the light on and off instantly with my phone, but the switch on the wall? 10 second delay. Dandy.\n\nSeriously this thing can't control a light switch correctly -_-\n\nCreating a user account was painful as well. I first tried to do it online: why use my smartphone when I have a full-sized keyboard at my PC? Well I couldn't because it refused to accept that I clicked the \"captcha - I am not a robot\" button no matter how many times I tried. I then signed up on my phone without issue.\n\nI'm a software engineer, so I'm like \"okay well I'll just log in and make my own API to make the light switch work\" - that's one of the reasons I bought this device. So I logged in under the SAME ACCOUNT I used to connect with my phone, and none of my devices are listed there and there are no instructions. All I see is \"You have no devices.\" Not content with this, I fumble around the site a bit and find a way to access my devices (It's a terrible UI - I had to essentially click around until something worked under location, and then re-login with the SAME credentials for some reason and then my devices appeared). So I see my listed devices, but the lighting app I installed to control the lighting isn't there. Well that's great... how am I supposed to update it? I double-checked and the smart app is still showing up in the android app. What kind of black magic is this?\n\nSo I log into the main site (sso.smartthings.com) thinking I can mess around with it there and it doesn't even take my credentials (nor does shop.smartthings.com). The main SmartThings login keeps telling me my password is bad - the same one I used to log into the android app AND the API site. I've tried to log into the main site periodically since I bought the device to no avail.\n\nI don't know how this product could get any worse. Everything about how this works is overly complicated and STILL doesn't work properly. I can't wait to get rid of it... if only I could return it...."}

After my first install, I immediately purchased another for my own home.\n\nThe first install was for a clients home that was up and running on Vera. The home is a beautiful luxury Airbnb rental owed by sophisticated client. When my client advised they never used the Vera System. I felt like someone had gut punched me. After all, I had spent days setting it up, working through macro scenes and settings. Often on the phone with Vera tech support in Romania. When I asked why? The answer was one I had heard before, it's just too confusing , the app is too cluttered. Reasearch lead me to Samsung SmartThings. I was able to convert 34 nodes to work with the SmartThings Hub in about 2 hours. No Coding, No Complicated formulas. Just a simple set up procedure . I was even able to do everything on my IPad. I could quickly pair the door locks, the three thermostats, the doorbell, exterior lighting control, even the pool heater. The SmartThings Hub works across many platforms. It even has easy to use options for cameras.\n\nThe most important feature for this system, (based on my years of home improvement) is ease of use. This system is a snap to understand. Walks you through the automation process step by step. Even will direct you from the app to online manuals for individual products! I expect the system will get even better as Samsumg Engineering and Product Development innovates and updates the product. It works with such a wide range of accessories. I just finished installing at my home too. I highly recommend to first time Automators, to Advanced IT Nerds like me. I will have some Vera units to drop off at the goodwill."}

The ability to log into the developer panel is great, and allows you to either create or install custom apps that others have made made it one of the most flexible and customizable.\n\nThe entire Home Automation industry has been, and continues to be one of the most difficult and frustrating things to setup, get configured, and then support and maintain. It's not Smartthing fault, and they have a lot to consider and design around.\n\nThe V1 hub when it was initially designed put all the smarts and logic of the smart home in the cloud where they could continually improve, and update the code that makes your smart home run. Great when you're a kickstarter and small, but just considering that each devices can send 50-200 status updates a day, and when you start getting 20+ devices, and 100,000+ customers the network load for such a system is extremely complex to implement and maintain. Samsung bought out the kickstarter company, and eventually they released a V2 hub (this device).\n\nFirst, migration from old to new didn't exist (not sure if it does now). So basically for all your individual devices you had to figure out how to manually uninstall each device, which required manually removing each device from every smartapp it was hooked to. Delete all your setup. Then manually join each device to the new hub, and then re-program all your smartapps, and logic. REDICULOUS.\n\nSecond, they put more powerful hardware and more storage into the V2 hub, and it looked like they were going to put more of the processing locally into the hub to make things more reliable. Never happened. There's been 9 documented outages of the server infrastructure became non-responsive for hours (and one time it was down for 9 days) due to load. Still to this day they are still having problems. The straw broke the camels back today, when my alarm sirens are not configured ANYWHERE in my configuration to do anything other than flash (because of the unreliability) started having the siren go off. Login to the app to turn them off? Unresponsive. Luckily I was home and could pull the power and batteries out to silence them.\n\nI can't forsee anywhere in the future where they are going to reengineer their system to remove this utter reliance on 1) web connectivity and 2) their servers being 100% reliable. Why do I say that? Because for the long term business model to make this product profitable they need to have a recurring fee - and that recurring fee will one day be their alarm system and camera integration/cloud recording. So their corporate structure relies on them not moving the smarthome logic into the hub from the cloud.\n\nGoodbye SmartThings."}

I'm still shopping for an affordable solution that will replace this thing but I have not found one yet. Lots of hours spent have been spent messing with these things over the years. I have 50 z-wave devices of all different types, smart thermostat, Karotz, echo, other stuff for reference.\n\nRating some capacities of Smarthings vs other systems -\n\nProduct Support - You can find ways to make these devices work easier than the other systems. Sometimes that means a custom device handler, but the community has doe its homework and will help.\n\nEase of Use - Really the best feature of this system. The app is pretty good. I'm more interested in automating and not using my phone. I would appreciate a native app that worked on tablets or even a nice wall mounted interface product from Samsung.\n\nCustom Process Ability - This is OK but has some issues with local processing and threaded race conditions. Don't think that you can persist variable data in the cloud to be used .05 seconds later! The community helps with this but it is definitely not ironed out. Most issues are with processes that occur over time. Anything immediate is fairly well supported. You have to get out of the old \"synchronous\" style of thinking.\n\nLatency - Even a little latency kills me with motion lights. I'm half way through the hall before it turns on and this is too slow. I don't think this latency is acceptable because it is cloud based or weakly locally processed (and I have nice Internet and network gear).\n\nWhat I've tried -\n\nVera edge - ok, but buggy. Scripts run locally and in a big recurring LUA loop that ends up blowing up for intense processes. The web interface was not always telling you the truth as well. Not a bad tinkering system because things work.\n\nHome Assistant - This is the open source version of Smarthings! Not a bad interface, but the need for lots of configuring and debugging all my z-wave inclusions has steered me clear of this. Also the threaded processing is not what I'm looking for. This is the one to watch if you are looking for a new system. I think in 6 months this one will be worthwhile trying again with the short release cycle.\n\nOpenHAB - less user friendly and configuration heavy. Home Assistant is the better of the 2 Open systems I tried.\n\nAnyway, Smarthings has its shortcomings and will make you angry - but the other systems will too. So is the current state of the home automation hub selection."}

This hub works with a lot of different manufacturers for it's things/ accessories. This Hub is easy to use and has an Android app and also and IOS app. The app allows you to control and monitor your devices that are hooked to the hub.\n\nI have been able to use multiple other manufacturers with this hub such as GE light bulbs, Cree light bulbs, Lowe's Iris accessories as well as the Samsung SmartThings brand.\nI did have a small problem with Philips Hue however to my understanding a contract is being worked on as we speak so SmartThings will be able to control the Hue Lights without having to purchase the Hue hub.\nI love that this product is truly an open system because even though Samsung SmartThings might not support a particular manufacturer there are workarounds 2 getting those items to work as long as there is zigbee or Z-Wave or Wi-Fi devices. The contact customer service links are answered by the Developers for smart things and they are very helpful and knowledgeable and allow for you to send screenshots and accept screenshots and I have been nothing but please with their eagerness to help and emails being answered back the next day.\n\nThe only thing I can say that I wish was a little better was the app 4 SmartThings. It isn't bad and it is easy to navigate through however it does take a couple days to remember all the different steps you have to do to make rules for your devices.\nAn example would be how I wanted to make a rule that my motion detector increase my porch light to 100% and decrease back down to 40% when the sensor doesn't detect movement. It was easy to make the light come on and go off completely when sensing motion however to keep the light on at a dinner level was complicated and required me to do some extra steps. Those steps and rules are laid out in the app but it's just not as straightforward as doing the basics cenarios of turn on the light when I come near or when the door opens turn on the light or sound the alarm when the window opens exedra.\n\nAll in all I am very happy with my hub from SmartThings and I also like how the app does have a place in it called Marketplace inside the SmartThings app that will tell you the different devices that it supports and show you a picture of those devices plus the model number plus even have a link to where to buy those devices so you can really make the most of your experience. I am convinced that this is the best head out there because I don't see anything else doing anything that this one doesn't already do or isn't capable of being programmed to do and best of all there is no monthly subscription and I don't have to pay anybody if I choose not to. There is a security company that will monitor your cameras and things through SmartThings if you choose to go that way however you don't it's purely optional."}

When we initially got it there was major inconsistencies in pairing \"things\", as well as instability in keeping those \"things\" paired. After several updates, we're finally seeing improved stability in our devices/things, and really appreciate Samsung's commitment to improving their product. Below is a pros and cons of the current system:\n\nPros:\n* Works seamlessly with Amazon Alexa.\n* More and more compatible devices being added slowly.\n* Improvements in stability with updates.\n* Faster initial pairing of \"things\" (use to take 1-30 min., now less than 2 minutes per pairing)\n* SmartApps allow for a variety of customization, but not seamlessly (e.g. using motion sensors to trigger lights requires downloading a SmartApp vs. programming it from the \"things\" or routines menu in the app)\n* IFTTT compatible\n\nCons:\n* Some major brands not added as compatible devices (e.g. Nest, Arlo, Dropcam, etc.)\n* Samsung SmartCam has no functionality in Smarthings App (only live view)\n* Some \"things\" get unpaired due to distance, requiring re-connecting (3rd floor -> 1st floor), slightly less often now (every few months)\n* Pairing requires \"things\" to be close to hub for faster \"adding/connecting\", or for connecting at all. (Tip: use a nearby lamp that's next to the hub to swap in and out bulbs to connect)\n* SmartThings App not user friendly for advanced programming (e.g. SmartApps functionality)\n\n\"Things\" Reviews:\n* GE Link 65W Equivalent Soft White BR30 (3-star)- Least stable of all bulbs tested/used, but the cheapest. Initially, it took 20-30+mins. to pair each bulb, now it only takes 2-3 minutes. The pairing is lost over time, if the distance is too far (2 stories away). Re-pairing, or resetting is required every few months, but again, updates have improved this. The small ring of leds in the bulb are more annoying to look at since there is no opaque covering.\n* Sylvania Ultra 11-Watt BR30 (5-star)- Better flood light than the GE link in all aspects: faster pairing (instant), opaque shell for better look and even lighting, more stable at longer distances, and faster/smoother dimming.\n* Cree Connected 60W Equivalent Soft White (5-star)- Very stable, fast pairing, good at long distance, smooth dimming and nice warm lighting. Only con is that it could be brighter.\n* SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full HD (3-star)- Fast pairing, and very stable. Pros: 2 way audio, good night vision, sd card storage, can turn off status light. Cons: SmartThings app is live view only (requires SmartCam app for programming), even with customizable areas to ignore, still to sensitive (e.g. still senses dog or lights), no optional colors.\n* Zen Thermostat (4-star)- Fast pairing and very stable. Pros: Integrated into SmartThings App, sleek look, compatible with Alexa. Cons: Slight delay from change on App, to change on thermostat/AC, App degrees is in decimals, while thermostat degrees isn't (e.g. 75.6 vs 75 degrees)\n* Samsung SmartThings Motion Sensor (4-star)- Good sensor, but loses pairing every now and then (e.g. 1 sensory every few months). Easy reconnection. Stability improving with updates.\n* Aeon Labs Door/Window Sensor (4-star)- same quality as Samsung motion sensor above. Only difference is size/look.\n* Aeon Labs Siren, Gen 5 (4-star) - stable, and fast pairing. Only con is that some of the alarm choices aren't loud. It also needs to be plugged into an outlet, and in the open (not behind an object) for best volume and sound quality.\n* Aeon Labs Minimote (5-star) - great steady and customizable remote. Allows each button to be configured with \"things/devices\", modes, routines, or notfications. Option to press or hold each button, so 8 total programmable buttons.\nZ-Wave Garage Door Tilt Sensor (4-star) - pretty stable, fast pairing. Lost connection once in 6 months. Tape that comes with the sensor does not stick well to aluminum garage doors; use 3M instead.\n\nPlease view video for demo of \"things\" with the App and Alexa.\n\nOverall, the updates have vastly improved the quality of the smart home system. With Samsung slowly adding new compatible devices, and the system able to maintain more consistent connections with it's things, we are happy with our purchase and recommend it to all tech savvy people. For those who just want basic functions such as turning a light on and off/dimming, the system might be a pass. In my opinion, the SmartThings system is best suited for people who 1) Use Amazon Alexa, 2) Use IFTTT, 3) Can figure out SmartApps for advanced customizing of \"things\".\n\nPlease see video demo for ideas on how we use our \"things\"."}

After a lot of research and ton of reviews I went with the SmartThings hub two and I haven't looked back since. You can just stop you're search here, this is the zwave/zigbee/dlink/whatever hub you're looking for! It has paired with all of my things very easily! GE switches, cree LED bulbs, g2g thermostat, GoGarage door opener, door locks...just everything. Right now I have about 30 Things connected to it and at least 12 Routines and just a bunch of SmartApps. If you are confused at what \"Things\" are or \"Routines\" or \"Smartapps\" than its ok. I was too when I was first buying a ST, but i got the hang of it in no time, its very intuitive. I had a little problem with the door locks at first but with a little persistence I figured that our in no time. What I love about ST is that you don't have to be too techy to use it. Its very easy to add new Things and add new smart app to your Things. Its very easy to make new routines and to activate them. We have three phones connected to our ST hub and all of them are used as presence sensors which I think is supper cool. The presence sensing works most of the time, but sometimes I find myself and the garage door that hasn't opened yet or some to a dark house. It usually catches up in no time and i've never had it mis a routine completely, just a little delayed sometimes when using the present sensor on the phone. Don't get me wrong, it is a little glitchy sometimes, but most of the time it works great! I absolutely love how easy it is to lick switches with Amazon Alexa and ST. Just download the ST skill in alexa and in no time she knows all your switches and lights. For your locks and stuff there are some work arounds to get alexa to recognize them, but as a default alexa is not allowed to recognize those things. But ya, once you got everything set up on smarthings and named, but pair it with alexa and thats it. I just say \"Alexa, turn on/off (name) lights\" and she says \"ok\" and it just works! I haven't touched a switch in a while because I've ether been using alexa or things are just automated now. Using the ST to keep track of your home while you are gone it great as will. You can open the door for someone who is pet sitting, you can control the temp in the house, you can take a look at whats going on in the house or your front door, or wherever you might have a camera.\nAll in all getting a ST hub was the best choice! There is zero to very little delay and things have never just catastrophically failed on me. Some patience is required sometimes and some frustration might happen sometimes, but in all its been an amazing experience so far and I'm very happy with my ST hub. I've heard from other with a wink or others hubs and they are ether not doing as much with there hub or just can't do as much with their hub. Living in Florida we get random blackouts and the hub has survived well through all of it and never lost any setting! Im continuously growing my smart home and Im glad ST is at the center of it!"}

I've wanted to get my home into the current century with technology. This thing is amazing. I've linked it up to my front door so when someone unlocks it, I know who and when they entered. I've had to program this one because the door only says it was opened or closed. It does let me know it was code 1 or 2 or etc... So I programmed this to recognize that and actually tell me who it is. Each family member has a unique code that only they know. Perfect! I've connected it to my phones so I know when they come in my neighborhood and I turn on lights when its dark automatically. I turn on lights in the morning in the kitchen as I get ready for work and then they turn off when I leave. I will be getting door sensors and alarms as well. My brother had a water sensor that went off when his fish tank overflowed. It has a lever that fills up the tank as the water dissipates. He was hours away from the house. The alert went to his phone and he drove home as fast as he could. There was still damage to be fixed, but the whole house wasn't completely under water. Amazing community and company product support for this. I also bought a Philips hue hub because I liked the options for the lighting. I connected it to my SmartThings so I only have to control one device. Amazing.\n\nThe only bad thing is I have xfinity products that I was hoping this would connect to. Maybe there will be a firmware upgrade in the near future that will allow this. But for now I just plan to replace my xfinity stuff with products that work with this.\n\nPros: Great for making your home smart. Fully configurable to your own needs. Great support when you need it. Works with several connection types which gives you hundreds of products to use and customize your way.\n\nCons: Doesn't work with my xfinity products."}

I started with just the hub, one switch and an Echo from Prime Day. It all went in easy and worked as expected. One month later I now have about 6 switches including one 3-way switch and all are working fine with or without Alexa. A water sensor, a deadbolt and more lighting are next along with more rules/scenes/smart apps. I believe the reason some people are having issues is because their mesh network device distances are too far.apart so I've been growing my network out from where the hub is located and am adding simple plug in outlets as a 'booster' to ensure full and consistent coverage to the actual device I want to use. We'll see if this holds true as my network grows and becomes more complicated. btw: my devices so far are all Linear/GoControl except for the water sensor (not yet added) which is labeled for Iris zwave system from big blue box store. That device is apparently identical to one or two others available here on Amazon under other names but which cost 20% more.

The code to setup the unit would not work in the app until I reached out to support and they \"fixed\" a glitch of some sort.

Most of the issues I encountered were because of the SmartThings app, rather than functionality of the Hub. With support for WiFi, I was able to use the two Belkin WeMo outlets I've owned for years with the system. The Zigbee support worked with the two Arrival Sensors I purchased at the same time as the Hub, and the Z-Wave support for the GE12724 Smart Dimmer Switch I also purchased. I have purchased several other \"things\", and all have connected and worked with the Hub except one Cree Smart Bulb (which I believe the bulb was at issue). With help from the SmartThings community, I was even able to connect my WiFi Foscam cameras. Overall, I'm pleased with the SmartThings system, and other than some needed changes to the app, the automation and control capabilities are top notch.

However this is not a turn key solution, nor does the cost stop at this $99 hub.\n\nIf you are looking to get the most out of this thing, you must have some technical know-how and you must be willing to fork over some coin. If you lack either, there's a decent chance you'll be disappointment/overwhelmed/frustrated.\n\n- You need to know how to use the developer API site (Google \"smartthings api\"). This will help to fine-tune devices.\n- Being able to write custom SmartApps opens many doors in the way of adding functionality which isn't offered out-of-the box. They are written in Groovy using the web-based IDE on the developer API site.\n- In regards to actually 'automating' home actions...you have to be able to create rules and routines which make logical sense - sometimes \"if-this-then-that\" just doesn't cut it.\n\nZ-Wave and ZigBee, likely the two most popular protocols supported by SmartThings, both operate using a mesh networking topology. What this means is that if your hub is point A, and you want to use a device at point B, you may need to install (this includes buying) one or more devices between point A and point B in order for the connection to be stable. I see many negative reviews about light switches or other devices not reporting an accurate state - Well, you probably need to throw a repeater somewhere between the switch and your hub.\n\nDaisy-chaining devices like this gets pricey, but is absolutely necessary in order to build up a stable mesh network. The cheapest device/repeaters usually cost around $30. Hardwired devices like light switches, dimmers, and wall outlets are closer to $40 or $50.\n\nIf you lack the coin, honestly, adjust your priorities and put your money to better use.\nIf you lack the technical expertise, save yourself many frustrations and contact a home automation provider. They offer professional installation services, using equipment they have been professionally trained to configure, and will happily do so for many, many of your pretty pennies.\n\nEdit: Works great with Amazon Echo for added voice control."}

The mobile app's interfaces for both iOS and Android are abysmal. The are extremely difficult to navigate, and they data they show is almost always wrong. I have two z-wave smoke detectors and iPhones as proximity sensors. One of the sensors ALWAYS, 100% of the time, says it is away. I can delete it & re-add it and it will say \"Home\" for a few minutes, then give me an alert saying it has left, even thought I'm sitting right there with it in my hand right next to the HUB & connected to the wifi. The I will occalionally get false notifications that a smoke alarm is going off - pretty anxiety inducing when you aren't at home. After I get the alert, quite often the app will never update that the alert has cleared - going to the dashboard will say \"smoke detected\" for one of the alarms. After some undetermined amount of time it will finally change to \"clear\".\n\nI know this is more a review of the mobile apps, but the fact of the matter is that you really cannot interface with this HUB without them unless you want to go through their web interface, which is basically just a scripting interface. I would strongly recommend going with a different home automation solution and avoiding the Samsung piece of trash."}

I love that I can connect any Z-wave device, and they have support for common Phillips and GE colored LED bubls and light strips - but they don't have any fun programming like syncing up a room full of lights and going through a slow color-changing effect. Or Scene setups like if I want to sit down and watch a movie and want most lights off but a couple at 10% so I could see enough to walk to the bathroom. You'd think they'd have work out these very common expectations, but no, you need to go to open source programmers...usually some clever random guy on the web, who might not have the same hardware or wants/needs as you...so you waste time downloading and trying out apps that don't fit your simple needs. It's good hardware and can do everything you expect it to, I just really wish Samsung put more time into having a better built in software suite; even as geeky as I am, I'm just not in the mood to spend hours and hours trying out half-baked 3rd party apps to make this meet my simple expectations."}

Once I realized I **needed** to use a Smartphone/Tablet app, the rest was a breeze. The software isn't as simple as I'd expect, but that's more a review of the app than a review of the hub (but I think this is import to review here nonetheless, so see below). This hub has some indicator LEDs to explain whether it's connected or not, and if it's installing a firmware update. That's about the extent of the hub, very simple and easy to setup/configure. One last thing to note, it requires you to use the Ethernet port to connect it to your network, there is no built in wireless option. There are devices you can find that can bridge an Ethernet port to a wireless network though, should you absolutely need a wireless option.\n\nThis hub **requires** you to use a Smartphone/Tablet app to setup external devices and to do anything more than look at blinky lights. I find that a bit odd since really the apps aren't incredibly complex, but are mostly just displaying what the hub and the devices are doing. A desktop option, even a browser-based would seem to be just as simple.\n\nOnce inside the app, it isn't always intuitive to figure how to carry out things as simple as setting up a door sensor to alert you when the door is opened. You have to click through about 94 screens before you finally get to the point to set this alert, and if you decide to change it, another 94 screen taps are required. It just seems like a poorly designed UI for common/simple tasks. Does that make it more robust? Yeah, probably. But documentation would go a long way to help with that then. Something even more useful would be a desktop version so I didn't have to clickity tap for hours and hours to try to figure out what you might think I want to do with my sensors.\n\nOverall I gave this hub 5 stars, really because the hub is insanely simple and works exactly like I'd hoped it would. If this were also a review and rating for the app, this would definitely be a 1-2 star review. In the end, you don't have to use the SmartThings app to use this device, and because of that, this device should be reviewed on its own merit. Feel free to browse on over to OpenHab.org if you feel the SmartThings software to be lacking."}

Sadly, my recent experiences with support for this and and the Zen Thermostat leave me dismayed. The short version of the story is that since day one I have had problems between the SmartThings and Zen. Temperature changes happen randomly and without any cause that I can see in the logs. Sometimes they don't happen at all even when they are scheduled or sometimes a manual change of a few degrees at once leaves you with only a partial temp change. All of this leaves me with a severe lack of confidence that the SmartThings hub and my Zen Thermostat are working properly which causes both comfort issues and has a financial impact when your AC runs for three days as a very low temperature when you're out of town.\n\nI just \"dealt\" with these quirks for the longest time until very recently after having woken up in a sweat one too many times after the temperature in my house got up to 80+ degrees due to issues between these two devices. I started by contacting Zen support, who, of the two support departments has been much more responsive than the SmartThings people. After a few weeks, they finally referred me to SmartThings support saying it was a SmartThings issue. SmartThings support is very slow and when they did respond, the explanations or advice were often not clear or made assumptions about things that were not obvious. After 2-3 weeks with them, I finally opened a chat session with support and after quite some time, they said this was a Zen problem. So, I emailed Zen. Guess what they said on my first email back to them? You guessed it! It's a SmartThings problem! So, here I am stuck between two support departments who are pointing fingers at each other and I still don't have a solution. To Zen's credit, they did suggest something that needed to happen on the ST side and they sent a followup email this morning with the ST support group CC'd asking if we'd made any progress. Two full business days since my last communication with ST and they are still silent.\n\nSO, I'm done. I'm going to just go buy another smart thermostat and ditch both the Zen and SmartThings. Fortunately, I didn't invest much in SmartThings like I originally intended and really the only thing I was using it for was my Zen. Regrettably, I did end up buying two Foscam video cameras on the rumors in the SmartThings forums that they would eventually be supported. To this day, nothing. While disappointing, that one is on me as I rolled the dice and lost.\n\nIn short, if you are VERY tech savvy with code and such, have a lot of time and LIKE to tinker, then SmartThings might be a great choice for you. If like me you just want a product that just works, with an intuitive interface and from a company who will be helpful when it doesn't, then this product isn't a good fit. My past experience with companies that are the \"middle-ware\" between multiple other vendors (like SmartThings) has taught me that success is predicated on the ability to support the products with which they integrate. Customers don't care and don't have time to navigate two support groups to cobble together a solution. This means going the extra mile, suggesting out of the box solutions and not simply saying at the first convenient opportunity, \"Oh, that's the other guy's problem.\" Sadly, SmartThings didn't do this for me, so buy at your own risk."}

We only use it with Z-wave products (three kwikset locks, motion detectors and a water alarm. Also like that we can use our Samsung smart phones as fobs, so that when we both go out and forget to lock up, the hub does it for us once we are out of wi-fi range. It took us FOREVER to settle on this hub, as every one we looked at had such varied reviews.\n\nUpdate: Most disappointing. After our initial success, the hub became erratic. Locks would unlock on their own. The hub would fail to recognise things already installed. Reaction times are often very slow. Locks show 'locked' or 'unlocked' in error. Pressing 'lock' sometimes shows activity and then success, but looking at the lock nothing had happened. At one point the whole system stopped working. This is unacceptable for a security system device. I'm not sure how much of the problem is the device and how much is the app; but since they are inextricably linked it really does not matter. If either fails the other is useless. Using the phones as fobs was useless as the hub often reported that one or both of us were present when we were not, or vice-versa. Our previous hub was a Honeywell Tuxedo Touch. It never failed to work properly the three years we were in that house. I reset the hub and now have most of the devices re-paired onto it. Time will tell if my next update removes another star or adds one.\n\nUpdate 2: It's official, I hate this thing. Devices work sometimes, don't work, sometimes pair, don't pair. Devices start and stop working as the spirits decide. The worst thing is Smartthings report that it locked doors that remain unlocked. I've gone so far as deleting all my settings and starting over, twice... if anything it got worse. My GE light switches, which once worked nearly instantly, now will turn off but not on, or vice versa, and sometimes after a long delay will switch. We just had a firmware upgrade push and it helped nothing. I never had any trouble with my old Honeywell Tuxedo Touch, using many of the same sorts of sensors, but it would not send messages to my phone, like this does (except they can't be trusted).\n\nUpdate 3: Hmmm...going up from one to two stars. Perhaps firmware pushes from Samsung have had some effect. It is still not perfect, still lies to us about a few things, but for the most part it has started working quite a bit better. We still do not rely on it for home security...just not reliable enough, but it works okay for home automation. We're thoroughly disappointed that the TCP Connected bulbs, remote and interface box, which we bought because they were compatible, have now been dropped by SmartThings. They still work on their own, but no longer with SmartThings. We've added more devices, mostly GE switches and modules, and they all are working. Perhaps Samsung will eventually get this right...time will tell. The only 'good' thing about this disaster is that we've learned a lot, and we see that most of the other hubs have mixed reviews too. This stuff should work better, much better, out of the box. We're adding an Echo to the system and will report on how that goes.\n\nUpdate 4: The ST hub seems to have settled in and is now working properly most of the time. I must stress that we've done nothing since we downgraded our rating to 1-star and pronounced hatred. So, it must be the firmware pushes that SmartThings has been sending. We added an Echo and an Echo Dot (also reviewed) and they work better than expected to voice control the ST hub. We don't know who to blame, Samsung or Amazon, but the ST hub and the Echos are only PARTIALLY COMPATIBLE; not all the devices registered on the ST hub are discoverable on the Echos. For example, we cannot voice-control our Kwikset locks. On the strength that Samsung may be getting this right, we bought a second hub for our cottage. We'll use it to alert us to any alarm there (full-blown Honeywell automation, perimeter, smoke, motion system), using a contact switch, and to control the Honeywell thermostat.\n\nUpdate 5: We have two of these hubs, one in our home and one in our cottage, together with a plethora of devices on each. It has been a love-hate relationship. That said, Samsung continues to push firmware updates into the hubs, the reliability is now very good and the companion software (app and web site) reasonable. We have not had to do a total reset in ages, and added devices now pair easily. The kwikset locks, which were at one time not working reliably at all, now work 99% of the time. So, we are adding a star to give this hub a 4-star rating, which is really saying something, as at one point we hated the thing. We've only limited experience with competing hubs, but based on continuous study, this seems to be one of the front runners."}

If you're using this for home security, you are extremely un-secure.\n\nThe thing booted right up, updated for 10 minutes or so, the app loaded and followed the router, setup was a breeze with my garage door tilt sensor using a time of day notifications rule. It was super easy and effective.\n\nNext I went looking for the rule. Not so easy. Then an extra back button press on the home screen apparently logged out my account off the phone and reset all of my programming and device linking.\n\nThe hub would not link to the tilt sensor again, and then it just fell offline according to the app, even though the hub showed a proper green link. After an hours worth of reboots, I contacted support. The next day, after it had come online all by itself 12 hours later, support told me the Could was having trouble and that's what I was seeing.

I had not read much good about either, but a lot of bad about ST, so I went with Wink. After setting up Wink, I was quickly disappointed with the lack of anything more than basic functionality. I did some more searching on the SmartThings community site and found a few threads from a month or so ago that were talking about significantly improved SmartThings reliability, so it seemed that all of the negatives I had read earlier had been fixed. One day after I had my Wink hub up and running, I requested a return and ordered a SmartThings hub.\n\nNow, 3 days after setting up my ST hub, I have been able to automate nearly every switch that I have, using time-based triggers, triggers like plugging cell phones in, performing different actions when different people get home at different times of day, controlling one switch with another, using one dimmer to set the dimming level of another dimmer, etc. The app and web interface have TONS of functionality, and the community forum has an answer for nearly every question that is not \"officially\" supported. It took me a little bit to get used to the app layout, but after playing around for a couple days I'm pretty comfortable with it. The SmartThings IDE web interface is good, and offers a lot of \"power user\" type of functionality. Between Amazon Echo integration, IFTTT channel, custom user-created SmartApps, and Logitech Harmony integration, this hub has an answer for nearly everything. Very happy with the purchase."}

I'm glad I waited to buy this device, because I hear it used to be slow, buggy and unreliable. My experience so far has been mostly great. No missed events. No false alarms. Motion sensors work very well. Water sensors on the multisensor work well. Amazon Ech support works well. The only two issues I've had is getting the system to detect new devices. I found it helps if you place the device very close to the hub. In the case, where I can't move the device, like a wall outlet, I sometimes use a long extension cord to move the hub. Not ideal, but you only have to do this once. Another solution is that most devices have a button you press, or a sequence like press the button on the device, while plugging it in and wait until the light changes color. That seems to work, although it still sometimes takes a minute or so to find devices. My other issue was not understanding that only powered devices are repeaters and a ZigBee repeater won't help with Z-Wave devices. Once I understood this and bought 2 repeaters to extend the range, my accuracy went to 100%. I only have 16 devices on my network, so I hope my good luck continues as I buy more devices."}

Not a whole lot of documentation comes with the device or is available online. When I initially set it up I had 3 green lights show up but the app would not connect and kept saying the hub was offline. Repeated attempts at rebooting it didn't help either.

Adding devices - As I mentioned the house came with most of the z wave switches and i was a bit worried about being able to add devices that had no identification marks (brand etc.). The documentation that comes with the device/app is also a bit lacking.

Adding these then on to smarthings was easy by just using the \"connect a thing\" feature. Once I got the hang of it I was able to reroute all the devices to the new network in no time\n3.

After wasting about a day trying to get it working, I still was no where.\nIt's now 3 months later and it still isn't working.\nThey don't offer anything that works with windows but you can go online and work with it a little. Also, apparently they were going through some transition and I ended up with two different accounts in two places which is confusing to me and more confusing to them.\nThe only app Smartthings provides is one that tells you if the lock is locked and allows you to lock or unlock it. In other words it's strictly a toy.\nWhy not get the app working to handle the capabilities this lock offers???\nThis schlage lock is very nice but the idea is I need the ability to enter codes remotely for my renters.\nI believe it was Wink hub so I may end up replacing smartthings with something that will work.\nRecently I connected it to my Total Comfort thermostat but the app really doesn't come close to the free online app offered by Honeywell.

Sadly, my own recent experience makes it impossible to give this product anything but 1 star. The only positive thing I can say is that installation and setup were very simple; my hub was up and running in 5-10 minutes, and my 2 GE Z-Wave Smart Switches were added shortly thereafter. (There was a bit of work involved, chatting with Support, because these devices had been part of a different Z-Wave network and had not been properly disconnected/removed from that network; but that process was to be expected, and fairly painless.)\n\nBeyond that, I have nothing good to say. Relative to other people with installations of scores or hundreds of Z-Wave devices, I only had 2 devices. Even without attempting automation, the results were inconsistent. I would \"turn on\" one of the lights via my iPhone app, then go to that room only to find that the light *wasn't* on... same thing trying to turn off a light that was on - the app would say it was off, but it was really still on. If the SmartThings hub can't correctly keep track of whether a device is on or off, what chance does it have to get any automation to work reliably?!\n\nFor automation, I tried installing the \"Smart Lights\" SmartApp that Samsung recommends. At about 5pm, I set it up to turn both lights on at 7pm, and to turn them off at 10pm - not a very challenging scenario. No dependencies on Home versus Away mode, or anything like that. I then went about my evening and forgot about things for a while. Only when it got to about 8:15pm, and I noticed that neither light had been turned on, did I really start to wonder if all of the negative reviews were true. Earlier today, I deleted the Smart Lights app and installed instead the \"Vacation Lighting Director\" app, since its intent matched pretty exactly what I wanted (randomly turning lights on and off in the evening, to simulate people in the house when everyone is really away). I had more success with this app; it randomly cycled power to the light in the room I was in a few times in the first 2 hours I had the scenario running. But I found once again that the iPhone app couldn't reliably show the actual state of the lights; it showed one light as \"off\" when it was really on, and vice versa for the other light. I suspect this is a problem of the iPhone app, rather than the Vacation Lighting Director smartapp - but in either case, the end result is a Z-Wave controller where I can't reliably count on the reported state of any of the controlled devices. That's a very, very bad thing for one of the supposed leaders in home automation..."}

After adding an Echo, Envisalink, Harmony Hub & Rachio I truly have a smart home!", "Text": "I bought the Smartthings Hub last November with a few light switches to automate. I already had an Amazon Echo and quickly integrated it with the hub and switches. I loved being able to control the lights by voice. (Simple things like turn on the light above the kitchen sink via the Echo - handy when my hands are dirty).\n\nWithin a few months I added and integrated so much more. A Harmony Hub to control my TV/entertainment center (including a Fire TV and HTPC), an Envisalink (which through some programming connected my existing wired alarm to Smartthings), door locks, garage openers, connectivity and routines via IFTTT, a Rachio sprinkler/garden controller and more.\n\nWhen we want to watch TV I tell the echo to \"Turn on TV Time\" and my Family Room lights turn on, my first floor lights turn off and the TV turns on. When the last person goes to sleep he/she tells the echo to \"Turn on Sleepytime\" which turns on a hall light, then 30 seconds later turns off all lights, turns on the alarm system (via my Smartthings integration with Envisalink), locks the front door, and turns off the entertainment system (via Smartthings integration with Harmony). (\"Sleepytime\" would turn on by default at 12:30am if no one manually sets it). When anyone in the family comes home, the presence of their phone is detected which turns off the alarm system and unlocks the front door. And there is just so much more that I have Smartthings programmed to do.\n\nThe Envisalink and the HTPC integration requires code to be run on a computer. But almost everything else is done through Smartthings apps. Some tasks are simple, others more complicated. I also use IFTTT for a few tasks (like telling Siri to open or close my garage doors).\n\nUp until a few weeks ago I would have given the Smartthings Hub 5 stars. But I experienced two glitches recently. The first glitch was when my Family Room lights came on for no reason. The second glitch was an outage when nothing worked for about 15 minutes. Overall, I would have thought these to be minor annoyances as they are the only glitches I've had over a seven month span. But, when I looked into this more, I found that my issues are related to the Smartthings cloud (many Smartthings tasks run from the cloud using the Smartthings back end database that has had some issues and outages lately). Some other users have also experienced problems.\n\nEdit (6/9/16): I am downgrading my rating from 4 to 2 stars. Oh, how I want things to work smoothly again. I have had a number of issues over the past two weeks. Mainly there are the delays. Previously, commands executed within a few seconds. Now, while most commands execute quickly, some take 10-20 seconds. And there are times where commands execute after a significant delay. I've had a few delays in the range of 15 minutes to just over an hour. On 3 occasions I came home expecting my door to be unlocked and a light on (from a presence sensor), but that was not be the case. The command to unlock the door and turn on the light DID execute, but each time it was after I was in the house - with a delay as long as 20 minutes after entering. I do have many devices and from what I've read it appears that the more devices you have the more likely there will be issues like these. Another issue is that my My Amazon Echo stopped recognizing the 'Sleepytime' switch. If I remove/add the switch it works again, but the fix is only temporary. I don't know if this is an issue with Smartthings or the Echo.\n\nI have also removed my HTPC and replaced it with a FireTV. My initial thoughts are that I like the FireTV more - especially with it's easy integration into home automation (via the Harmony Hub).\n\nEdit (11/10/17): Upgrading this back to 4 stars. While there still are some delay issues - these are relatively minimal considering how much I use Smartthings every day. There is about 1 glitch or major delay per month."}

Frankly, I don't know the difference between my first generation unit and my second generation unit! They just work and are so easy to set up.\n\nMy purpose in getting them was mostly to have a system of some sort that would alert me when doors are opened. As a bonus, they also work with my Z wave door locks. Both units were used to monitor unoccupied homes that were going through remodeling efforts. The Smart Things hub is a very quick and inexpensive way to set up a perimeter around the house. I used the AEON recessed sensors in each door because they are SO unobtrusive. In addition, I used the units, in conjunction with Z wave light switches, to control exterior lights. I also had one interior light set up to come on at dusk.\n\nOnce I figured out how easy it is to configure things on this unit, I was very impressed. The instructions that come with the accessories are not always very complete, but the accessories are the same ones that are used with other z wave systems so it's a wash. Generally, you start with the Smart Things app on your phone, tell it to look for a new item, then press the button on the device you're adding to get it to connect.\n\nOne hard learned lesson was that once the Smart Things hub and the Z wave device connect, a screen will pop up in your Smart Things app, asking which other app you wish to control the item you just connected. You'd better do your homework ahead of time, because it is difficult to figure out how to control your \"thing\" you just added unless you pick an app as you initially install it.\n\nEventually, I figured out how to remove the device from Smart Things, then add it again so I could use the correct app. The technology works, but it has a little bit of a learning curve. Likewise, the Smart Things web site is not terribly supportive. You're better off using Google to ask your specific question than if you try to search the Smart Things support section.\n\nAmong the big pros for Smart Things:\n\n1. It uses Z wave - which is getting pretty universal. I believe it also uses Zigbee.\n2. It is inexpensive for a hub that can do so many things.\n3. There are NO monthly fees, even for advanced functions.\n4. Connecting new \"things\" to the hub is pretty painless\n5. Alerts can be emailed or texted very quickly\n\nI have a third Z wave hub that is much more powerful and not that much more expensive. It's just a bit too powerful for most folks to set up, but it's the unit I use at my home. It allows much more complex scenarios that you can set up yourself without an app. For most folks, I suggest starting with the Smart Things, then decide if you want something with more features.\n\nIn short - I don't hesitate to endorse the Smart Things hub as a good starting place for beginners who wish to quickly and inexpensively set up a home automation system."}

I spent hours reading reviews and trying to decide if this was the right hub for me. I installed it a week ago and I love it. Some reviews talked about failures and glitches. I have not had any.\n\nAlexa is the perfect compliment to the system. It's nice to be able to control kitchen lights by voice when your hands are full or wet. It's also pretty handy to have Alexa adjust the temperature if you're busy in the kitchen. Combining this with Alexa has renewed my home automation bug.\n\nIt installed surprisingly easy. I was replacing an existing Nexia home automation system. In less than 2 hours I had unenrolled all of my devices (2 thermostats, 1 door lock, 8 dimmers/switches) from the Nexia bridge and enrolled them on the SmartThings hub. I had most of the automation programmed within that first two hours. Once everything was enrolled I spent several hours playing around and getting to know the app while watching TV. Over that course of time I learned to fine tune my events a bit more. Admittedly the user interface is not as friendly as Nexia, but the trade off is more capabilities and more integrated products. I particularly like that it uses our phones to know when we are home or away. I am able to trigger events based upon the coming and going of individual phones. The ultimate bonus is getting more functionality without the monthly subscription. I didn't give much thought to the $10 Nexia Subscription, but free is free!!\n\nFor those who are replacing a Nexia system, my tip is to pull the instructions and read how to unenroll your existing devices. This must be done physically using the Nexia bridge (hub). I had to carry my bridge around to each device and do a series of button pushing. Removing devices on the website does not unenroll them. THEY MUST BE UNENROLLED BEFORE YOU CAN ENROLL THEM ON A NEW DEVICE LIKE SMARTTHINGS.\n\nTrane Thrmostats:\nI can confirm that the Trane TZEMT500BB32 and Trane XL624 thermostats do work with the SmartThings hub. I have full functionality, including temperature control, fan control, and mode control from the app. I can manually change both thermostats from the app and I can program a temperature change at bedtime, morning and when we are away. That's plenty enough for me, but less options than Nexia provided. I am still looking for a way to program two thermostats at two different temperatures more effectively. I can only program one temperature at each mode change. I can choose to send the temperature to one or both thermostats, but I can not send a different temperature to each. Overall, I'm happy with how SmartThings controls the Thermostats.\n\nCameras:\nNexia camera's do not work with SmartThings. I chose t replace my cameras with D-Link cloud cameras using their free app with no monthly subscription. Smarthings gives you a list of compatible D-link cameras. You can integrate those cameras into your SmartThings app, but that will incur a monthly subscription at some point in the future. It's currently free as a beta program."}

They do get a star for the hassle free warranty replacements. But they lose points for not having anyway to backup and restore. You must go through a 10 hour process to force delete items, unscrew them from the walls, hold them next to the hub, screw them back in, delete and recreate every simple automation you've made before.\n\nThey lose a star for marketing built in Bluetooth support, but customers are not able to access it.\n\nI should add this platform should never ever be used as a real alarm system. I discovered, as many others before me, that all you will get is false positives, and no way for you to fix anything without support email. In fact it didn't work at all when a neighbor did break into my house, the system had reset to disarmed for no reason. If you use a mobile device to automatically lock and unlock your doors, beware the geofence radius is huge. They do not use bluetooth or wifi assist to make it at least as small as wifi range. Instead, my geofence covers the next 27 houses, and the highway. Smart things says customers shouldn't use their phones, and should use the zigbee keychains. But as many other customers have found, that's even more unreliable. Smart things will disarm and unlock your doors for no reason, when the cloud says your dongle has arrived or departed when it hasn't or they just reset something on the cloud side. Apartment dwellers you have been warned.\n\nThey lose a star for not adapting their iOS app to iPad (which would take less than a few hours for them in Xcode by the way). They don't even have some form of web interface for a computer. The main concern here, is that you must register as a developer to even accomplish basic tasks like viewing the status of your devices. Did the device install local or cloud? What's my zigbee channel?\n\nThey get the second star for having some scripting access and being tinker friendly. The system is really locked down. It is not hacker friendly. You can't access the zwave or zigbee logs directly. You can't modify the radio channels, or add huge missing features like ota firmware updates to wireless devices, or even simple things like zwave device association.\n\nFrom what I have seen, Samsung bought smartthings to only integrate with the Samsung major home appliances. In fact new Samsung tv's will come out with \"smartthings\" integration, as long as you don't consider zwave, zigbee home automation to be part of it anymore. The future of this platform is uncertain."}

I can still access it through the camera's own software/app but that kinda was the whole reason I purchased that specific camera so that was a bummer.\n\nLately my biggest complaint is that the hub will just randomly perform our \"i'm back\" routine in the middle of the night. This, of course, involves turning on lights, disarming the security, and opening the garage door. So at 3 am I'm waking up to all the lights on in the house, and an open garage. The GoControl garage door opener has not been working properly for the last 3-4 months (see review on that) so even though I tell it to close itself from the upstairs master, I have NO idea if is actually close unless I go downstairs and check on it in person.\n\nThe hub ran great when I first purchased it. However, over time, and with more and more updates, it has started acting differently and sometimes won't recognize that my wife or I are home. We will sit in the driveway and wait for it to open the house up (until we lose patience and do it ourselves), it has somehow lost connection with 2 of the 3 motion sensors (2 different brands) and just lists them as \"unavailable\" despite them having over 50% battery left. A hard reset will reconnect them, but only for a day or so max.\nEvery time Samsung releases updates for the hug I expect this stuff to go away, but it never does.\n\nAll in all, I'd still recommend this hub, but not to someone who isn't comfortable with technology and troubleshooting.\ndropping it to 3 stars as it is becoming more and more unreliable as time goes by.\nIf someone from Samsung is reading this, I'd love your advice on how to fix the random, middle of the night routines, despite it having performed the \"i'm back\" routine for me at 9pm when i actually did get home. It did it to me 3 times last night between 1 and 5 am. :(\n\n5/9/2016\nFirst attempt at any kind of home automation. Ordered this and a GE 12722 Z-wave switch. Received both overnight from Amazon despite choosing 2 day shipping (thanks Amazon!).\n\nSetting up the hub was super simple, and I was happy to see it was all able to be done with the smartphone app, as my computer was having some minor issues. Setup itself took about 10 minutes, during which the app just did its thing and no input was required from me.\n\nAfter that I set up the wall switch (which took longer than setting up the hub itself). Once both were set up, everything paired well and there were no issues.\nHoping to add a few more goodies over time, but starting small. Next are TCP Connect lights, a dimmer switch, some thermostats, and a garage door opener. Will try to keep this updated as I go."}

{"Author": "Tom Steele", "Date": "on May 4, 2016", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Not readywork", "Text": "Matthew from Samsung has commented below. I thought that I would address a couple of those things here. First, I am aware that Smartthings and MyQue are not listed as compatible. They do work fairly well together though if you can navigate through copy-ninja's smart app and install it properly. Right now, after spending and hour or two at \"work\" with my co-worker trying to get things up and running, we were able to get Alexa, via Smartthings, to open my garage door. She won't close it back, but she will open it reliably. Which is not ideal, but a step in the right direction.\n\nI was NOT aware that smartthings and Hue didn't play well together. It is in your APP - so that is very confusing. I guess that I assumed Hue was sort of a standard in smart home functionality. Again, Wink works with BOTH of these things, very well. In fact, if it weren't for the unsupported ability to use Alexa and Smartthings together to use voice commands, I would find it very hard to see why I need the smartthings hub at all. The Wink hub is cheaper (even free I am told if you buy the right light kit) and hooks into a LOT of stuff natively.\n\nI will update soon when I get more functionality from the samsung smartthings hub. I believe Samsung will make this great eventually. But right now I've got customer service telling me that everything I'm trying to do is unsupported even though some of the things are in the app itself. That's a bad sign Matthew. When you have your app telling me to link up to the Hue lights but you are saying that I shouldn't expect it to work because it isn't supported - well, that's not good. And you mentioned that I should check the compatibility list as if that exonerates Samsung from not working with these things. Yeah, perhaps legally and financially. But from the perspective of a review of whether it is a good product, nope. It doesn't change at all that I - the customer - want it to work with these very popular products and it doesn't. Which is my point, I feel that smartthings is perhaps best left to those who want to use ONLY Samsung sensors with it, and Wink is better if you want to interact with other companies like Philips Hue, Chamberlain MyQ garage door openers, and others.\n\n---------Originally posted 5/4/16------------\n\nI really want this to work. I'm very frustrated that I cannot get it to work and I'm one of those people that reads other reviews and thinks, \"Ha, I wonder what they are doing wrong that they can't get it to work, I bet it will work fine for me.\" Except, it isn't.\n\nTo compound things, I have the Wink hub and it largely does work.\n\nThe reason I even bought this hub is that a co-worker has 75 connected devices, 4 Echo's, 2 Dot's and a very automated home. I am much more technologically oriented than most people I know, and even he and I have different areas of expertise where I outrank him in some areas and he outranks me in others. It is the ideal arrangement. Instead of the usual parasitic friendship where one person milks the other for help, we are able to help each other in different areas.\n\nHe convinced me to get the SmartThings hub because I already had one Amazon Echo and the Chamberlin MYQ garage door opener (much better than garageio at much lower cost IMHO) and several smart outlets and door locks and thermostat, etc... In his words, \"Alexa is much better than Siri, and SmartThings lets you use Alexa aka Amazon Echo).\n\nSo I ordered the hub and hooked it up. Things went smoothly. However, my app has remained largely unpopulated (except it knows that I have an iPhone - that is the only device it has registered yet.) in part because Samsung wants me to press the button on my Philips Hue Hub and it is upstairs in the Theater Equipment Room connected to the router and not wanting to exercise and go up and down stairs is the whole reason for getting smart home stuff, right? But today I decided to use my friend's expertise to get my garage door opener working with Alexa.\n\nApparently this requires a workaround because the various companies have decided that we are too stupid or they will be too liable if they let you open doors and/or locks with Alexa because someone might stand outside your house and yell at the top of their lungs to unlock the front door or the garage door and then have access to your home. A valid concern I suppose, but one that I should - as the user - be able to decide. Not them.\n\nSo apparently someone has written custom code in the smart things community to operate the MYQ garage door opener via Alexa. I want that. It is one of the PRIMARY reasons I have invested in smart home tech.\n\nI couldn't get that to work, in spite of carefully following my co-worker's instructions.\n\nNext I decided to take a step back towards simplicity and just have the app search for connected items in my home. I suspect that I have 20-25 things at this point. It didn't find one thing. It just sits and spins and says it is looking for things and it could take some time...\n\nSo, I decided to take another step backwards and just get the Hue lights up and running. I went to install the Hue hub and followed the instructions in the app. It discovers the Hue Hub which is hard wired into my router via a smart switch (something you will need once you have more than four things going to your router) and it works great with the Wink Hub and the Phillips App. SmartThings discovered the hub and then told me to press the button on the Philips Hue hub (this is required for ANYTHING you do with the Philips Hue Hub) and as soon as I pressed the button on the hub, the app started flickering rapidly and then crashed. I restarted the app and it told me that it had sent an error message to home (Samsung) and so I tried again. It is a VERY repeatable crash. I sent an error report to Samsung and am waiting for instructions on what to do next.\n\nSo right now, I have a $99 hub that news when my iPhone gets home and leaves my house. And an app that crashes a lot and a github account with a garage door opening smart app within the smart app that seems to go nowhere and Alexa doesn't know where it is and it doesn't work.\n\nHopefully I have provided enough details that will let you decide that I am clearly doing something different than you would be doing and it will work great for you and you can go ahead and order it anyway. ;-). I looked very seriously into smart home devices a couple of years ago when Casa Verde was about the only thing out there and I came to the conclusion that it wasn't quite ready for prime time.\n\nI'm still not sure if it is ready for prime time. Sure, if you want turn some pretty lights on and off, there are some neat gadgets out there. But I'm not convinced you can throw away your ADT subscription yet. Perhaps the most frustrating thing is the lack of information about what is going wrong and lack of plans to try and figure it out and fix it. Right now I just feel helpless and have to hope against hope that customer service will write back and say, \"Oh yeah, here's what's wrong and here's how you fix it.\" But more likely they will write back and tell me to reboot the hubs or something like that, which I have already done..."}

Now that I've set up the things that I have, though, I think we'd both be disappointed if we lost these capabilities.\n\nI used to use X10 switches for lighting throughout the house. I had a motion/photo sensor aimed out a back window. When it got dark, the sensor would send a signal that would turn on the foyer and front porch lights, so the dog wasn't in the dark and so we could see to open the door and not arrive to a dark porch. But depending on weather or who knows what else, X10 wasn't always strong enough to work throughout the house, and this resulted in hassle.\n\nThe Samsung SmartThings system has worked very well. The mobile application is easy to use. Because SmartThings works with multiple protocols, there is a good variety of controls and sensors to work with, and with more of each, you can do a wider variety of creative programs. Here's what we have done so far:\n* Turn on under-cabinet LEDs in kitchen when motion is sensed in that room.\n* Turn on front porch/foyer/Christmas lights half an hour before sunset (the system can look up when sunset will be that day at your lat/lon)\n* Send text message if water detected in laundry room\n* Send text message when spouses' cell phone arrives home\n* Turn lights on/off randomly during evening hours when we're on vacation\n* Turn off heat/air conditioning (via Ecobee3 thermostat) when French door to deck is open"}

I'm also disappointed that despite what they say, you are really tied to the cloud in order for this thing to work. Been having a helluva time trying to arm and disarm the security features recently, and ST this past week confirmed in an email to their users that they were having issues. I can't afford for my security system to be at the whim of \"their cloud.\" I just need the box to work, and work independently.\n\nAlso if you plan to use any device that has calibration features (like Aeon's Multisensor 6 to measure temp and humidity), you won't be able to calibrate it with ST. There's just no interface for the adjustment parameters.\n\nNot that Vera is perfect, but it solves most of the issues out of the box.

Also repairing the devices from the wink to the SmartThings Hub was no problem. All devices work perfectly. Also I am able to set specific tasks to perform whenever a device gives up a specific status (such as my own cellphone, when leaving the house, make sure the lock is set) and a bunch of other tasks. In addition, it is open source and there is a community that is growing and building custom tasks/apps that solve specific problems (wink doesn't have that). For example, Nest Thermostat support is not officially supported but through the community, you are easily able to add it. Great product, easy to use, lots of features, easy to configure, it had a RJ45 port and it has a compartment for backup with AA batteries which even comes included!"}

I'm literally just using it to handle 7 or so light switches. Waste of time and money. Changing my review to one star. More trouble than it's worth. Have had enough.\n---------\nI'm going to start this review off by saying my bar is low. All I am looking to automate is 4 GE z-wave light switches and then I'd like to add my Sonos and Nest systems if possible. I had a Revolv hub that worked perfectly but that has service is being discontinued as of May 2016.\n\nFirst, I tried the Wink hub. It was cheaper and had slightly better reviews. No dice on this one. It didn't seem to have a way to reset my GE switches that had already been assigned to the Revolv hub. Really simple stuff but after a couple of hours of fiddling, I gave up.\n\nNext I ordered this one. Setup took about twenty minutes and then I spent an hour or so attempting to connect my switches. I needed to reset them which required a search of the original manuals and some internet searches as well. This was an unreliable process but I eventually got it to work. From there it was pretty seamless.\n\nOn the whole, this thing seems to work for me for the little I've given it to do. Quite a positive given the sorry state of home automation gear but I'll take it!\n\nPositives\n- seems to work with light switches\n- user friendly and easy to use app based interface\n- straightforward process to setup routines. No coding required.\n- Samsung seems to be making a decent effort to support this product via an investment of resources\n\nNegatives\n- setup took longer than it needs to. An hour and a half for what should take 10 minutes\n- the hub has to remain manually connected to a router ie no wifi limiting range\n- no Nest support yet! This is an obvious one"}

I've also been using the system with the following \"compatible\" devices:\n\n* TCP Connected Smart LED Light Bulb Starter Kit - Gateway plus 2 wireless A19 Soft White (2700K) LED Light Bulbs\n* GE Link Wireless PAR38 Smart Connected LED Light Bulb, Bright White (3000K), 90-Watt Equivalent, 1-Pack\n* Aeon Labs ZW080-A17 Z-Wave Gen 5 siren for indoors - US freq.\n* Kwikset 910 Signature Series Traditional Electronic Deadbolt with Z-Wave Wireless Remote Home Automation Compatibility, Satin Nickel\n* Securifi Key Fob AL-KFB01 - Programmable buttons to Arm/Disarm your Home Security System\n* SONOS PLAY:1 Compact Smart Speaker for Streaming Music (Black).\n\nI was really excited about having this smart home setup after reading about the different systems out there, and the positive reviews here on Amazon for SmartThings. And when it HAS worked, it can be great. But in the time I've had this setup, there have just been so many problems and malfunctions that it has definitely been much more of a headache than a pleasure. Sometimes the problems have (possibly) been related to another party, for example my TCP light bulbs have often been uncontrollable for short periods of time and that could be a problem at TCP. But most of the other issues I've had have been posted and discussed on SmartThings' community forum, so I know that many other people have experienced the same broken connections and malfunctions I have, and the company often takes weeks and weeks to find a solution (if ever). Customer support has been slow and flakey - one time I contacted the support staff and I eventually got a canned response that didn't even come close to answering my very clearly worded question, so I gave up on them and figured out the answer myself through much more trial and error. And you can never call someone at SmartThings for help - you can only email them. I didn't catch that before buying their products, and I think it's a major con. So now I've gotten used to searching for the problems I'm having on their community forum - that's how I figured out that when my motion sensors stop registering motion (which in turn prevents them from detecting an intruder or turning on lights on the room), I have to pry each of them open with a screwdriver without breaking them, struggle to remove the tightly-held battery inside, and re-insert the battery while holding down the reset button. I have had to do this many times now, and the backs of them are all scratched up where I have to pry them open. I'm surprised I haven't cracked them - the plastic seems very flimsy.\n\nI think the main problem here is smart home marketing that has gotten way ahead of the actual capabilities of the technologies at hand. And that goes for other companies selling these types of products as well. The videos on SmartThings website that demonstrate all of the capabilities of the setup are misleading: things rarely work consistently enough to \"automate your life.\" And I've read the same complaints about other platforms, like WeMo and Apple HomeKit.\n\nAs I am writing this, I cannot connect to my TCP light bulbs nor the GE link flood light bulbs on my garage (finally had to go out in the garage and just shut them off), I cannot lock the deadbolt on my door so I had to do it manually, and my SmartThings app. has said there is an \"Intruder detected\" for two whole weeks now after we had a false alarm. I have tried all of the tricks I've read about on the forums to clear this message, and nothing has worked, so I've given up.\n\nThe whole thing has been especially irritating to my husband who is not tech-savvy at all, and he thinks I'm crazy for all of the money I've spent buying the hub and all of the products to connect with it. Our siren went off (again) a few weeks ago even though the app. was registering us both as being \"home,\" and he just about popped a blood vessel! Being the techy one in the house, I feel like I'm always apologizing for things not working as they should and always saying \"okay, I have to figure out why that's happening.\" We were out to dinner one night when our phones notified us that an intruder had been detected and the siren had been activated. I just turned it off and we continued eating, and I still don't know whether someone actually entered the house or not. It malfunctions so often, that it's basically pointless to use it as a security system because you can never trust that it is accurate.\n\nSo needless to say, I am really regretting that I ever starting buying all of these \"smart\" devices, and now that I can't return them, they will probably end up in a box in the garage (unless I can try to sell some of the stuff on eBay or something). HUGE waste of time and money, and a significant stressor to be always troubleshooting the next problem that's come up. I really wanted to like it and give SmartThings some time to improve (which they are always promising on their website and forums), but I just hate it at this point and I'm ready to be done with it. I'm thinking I'll wait about ten years, and then see where this technology is at."}

The ability to work with multiple communication formats (zigbee, zwave, wifi-hue, etc) is great. The integration with the Echo/Alexa is awesome. I would give it 5 stars except for a couple issues. The app is fair, it is not as intuitive as some and I find that it does not report the current status of devices accurately. Some devices that are locked appear unlocked, lights that are off appear on or vice-versa.\nMy biggest concern is that after growing the system gradually one device at a time up to almost 30 devices, I wanted to reconfigure/rename devices. It seemed the best option was to do a factory restore and start over. (I didn't integrate Alexa and the Hue bulbs the \"right\" way so things were a little messy) The only way to \"factory restore\" is to delete devices and what they call the \"Location\". I ran into a permissions error and contacted support via live chat. It only took 30 minutes or so to get an agent, but he was not able to help and needed to pass the issue to engineering. That was over a week ago and they have not addressed the issue.

Honestly this product is 3 years in with a v2 hub and it looks and acts like a prototype. Samsung better fix this soon or their reputation is going down the tubes. A lot of people have invested a large amount in their smart systems and this system although it has a lot of possibilities is absolutely awful. The people in charge of the UX for this app should be fired immediately, the GUI designers should go next."}

That requires a reset of my hub. Also, ive had an issue where the motion sensor will detect movement during the night but the siren won't trigger. I've woke up and checked my phone to see a missed alert. Scary thought. My wife's lamp doesn't turn off automatically at night like it should. It normally turns on at sunset, but after a week of perfection, it will stop turning off at 11pm. Lastly, the biggest issue i've had (because I can just arm and disarm the alarm myself) is with the door contact sensors. After about a week of resetting them, they no longer detect opening and closing. So my alarm system is basically functioning on my sole motion detector. I can reset the sensors, and they'll work right for about a week, then one day i'll notice that it says the sensor is open yet the door is closed. I'm sure i'm not the only one with these same problems. While I chose the smartthings system to be my choice for all things automated in my home. I regret the day I did. I've had nothing but poor performance, sleepless nights wondering if my system would work correctly throughout the night, and numerous days popping batteries out and in to reset sensors. Hope this helps someone else, because after last nights sensor reset, i've officially quitting smarttings and moving on."}

I had high hopes for the Samsung SmartThings Hub. However, so far been a disappointment. The device paired with GE zwave wall dimmers easily. Using the apple iOS SmartThings app, I can manually adjust the lighting fast and efficiently.\n\nWhere the device completely fails is in automation. The Hub is supposed to automatically turn on lights when I get close to home and turn them off when I leave the area. Despite all the appropriate settings on my phone being in place and speaking with Samsung support I still can't get the product to work appropriately. Even automation setting (such as the lights turning on or off at a set time everyday) continually fails to activate. For example, while on a recent vacation my downstairs and bedroom lights were to turn on at a certain time and go off - to help give the appearance someone was actually home. Checking my in-home security cameras (not linked to the SmartThings hub) I could confirm that the lights were not turning on. If Samsung can't get lights to automatically trigger with their system -- who in their right mind would trust them with the security systems that are linked to the SmartThings product? What is most telling is that even that Samsung representative said they had a bugs to work out. Buyer beware.\n\nUpdate: I have contacted Samsung support for a third time. They are only available over a chat function or email, which is very frustrating. Don't bother with email, as a rep will take forever to respond to your inquiry. The reps I have \"spoken with\" suggested I connect my system to another app called Life360 -- the provided instructions for integrating the two apps did not work (it looks like they are out of date). I'm waiting to hear back from them on corrected instructions. The second fix that was provided for automation involving the lights turning on at certain hours of the day was for Samsung to push an update to the hub. Again, this failed to fix the problem. I removed one star. Will update again in a week.\n\nUpdate Nov 2016\nI still have consistent issues with the hub's automation working. Every time I contact Samsung support I'm given a different answer why it's not working OR they blame it on an update that is to be made in the next couple of days. Support is polite but frankly they just don't seem to have real answers or fixes. I still regret this purchase."}

I followed instructions, downloaded the app, activated the hub and tried to pair with a device. The hub is sitting 3 feet from the device, and I have confirmed that the hub has an IP and can access the internet.\n\nThe light on the hub blinks green, indicating it is trying to pair with a device. It never pairs, it just blinks. I reboot, I reset (inset red button) no change. It is now Saturday morning, and I thought to contact support. No phone support, email or chat only and Chat is only available during the same hours that I am working (9-5 PST), so that kinda makes chat support useless. So I moved on to the forums, and learned that Samsung is basically ignoring the consumers. I signed up for a forum login so that I could post my experience, and surprise, the activation email never comes. That surely put a stop to the negative posts that were coming from dissatisfied buyers.\n\nBefore investing in the Samsung Smart Things, be sure to read the forum posts at [...]. If you see only good posts, then Samsung has cleared out the forums of bad news. I expect this soon, following the \"no new logins\" policy they have implemented.\n\nIn short, if you like being frustrated and ignored, then by all means purchase a Samsung product. ( I got pretty much the same result on the Samsung Smart TV I own )\n\nMy advice, save yourself the return postage, learn from my mistake. This unit is going back on Monday.\n\nA little more detail for the techies...\n\nThe hub has no open ports, so it is secure to the extent that only Samsung can get to it. Upon boot, it communicates with AWS at 52.21.172.80 port 443 [...].\n\n10.1.1.244.39970 > 52.21.172.80.443: Flags [.], cksum 0xc7ce (correct), seq 1572915405, ack 1185738456, win 443, length 0\n\n80.172.21.52.in-addr.arpa name = ec2-52-21-172-80.compute-1.amazonaws.com.\n\nStraight to an ec-2 instance, these guys are not even using a load balancer and multi-AZ deployment. Really amateur.\n\nAll communications are encrypted, so just what Samsung is getting back is not known. They may have a map of your internal network and access to your open file shares, this is not hard to do.\n\nBad Bad Bad.. Samsung needs to fire their CTO."}

SmartThings was about 15-30% functional for me while it lasted.\n\nMy home automation consists of a couple Echo's, Hue, locks, motion, open/close sensors, and outlets. It's only taken three months since setting up the system (and changing nothing since initial setup before today) for SmartThings to go haywire on it's own. Some of the hassles I've had to deal with include:\n\n-Inability to switch modes from armed to disarmed. Despite having ran the \"I'm home\" action, and it triggering the lights and door locks, it would not disarm the system and upon detecting a door open or motion, triggered the alarms and alerts which I was unable to turn off. I had to unplug the system and spend several days just resetting things and uninstalling/reinstalling the app. Switching phones had no effect.\n\n-Lights simply not responding, or some responding intermittently, and giving incorrect status in the app.\n\n-Door locks not responding and not updating to correct status, and taking minutes (sometimes up to a half hour) to respond to a single button press.\n\n-Motion sensors not working at all, or very selectively sometimes, despite working perfectly earlier in the day.\n\n-Multi purpose sensors constantly detecting knocks when there are none.\n\n-Never figured out how to get my existing cameras to work through the app. They just want you to buy one of their cameras with a monthly fee. I don't think so...\n\nNow SmartThings is dead. The only thing that's changed in my setup, is the addition of an Echo Dot today. I have no idea why it would affect anything, but SmartThings simply doesn't work anymore. At all. Even after unplugging the Dot. There are no issues with batteries in the sensors, I've reset, unplugged, reconnected, reinstalled everything multiple times. It just doesn't work anymore. My lights all still respond through the Hue app, but SmartThings does nothing. The motion sensors report no motion, no devices change status, I have no control over my locks.\n\nMaybe in 5-7 years someone will release a 100% functional and reliable smart home hub, but I've been messing around with this stuff for a while and it's just nowhere near ready for release."}

Then added Iris Smart Motion sensors (sold at a large box store) to trigger lights in our master bath area and on our front porch. Be advised, not all devices will be recognized out of the box by SmartThings. The community forum instructs you how to load specific device handlers which were developed by a great bunch of DIYers. The SmartThings app lets you set various conditions for the lights to include how long for the light to remain on after motion, etc. I love the fact that you can use Z-wave and Zigbee devices.\n\nYou can go simple or dive in. I'm trying to dive in so I bought the Amazon Echo. It (she) now controls the lights. When you add a user developed app (Alexa Helper) to SmartThings you'll discover ways to group lights and create routines. I added a number of contact sensors for exterior doors, windows, and an internal cabinet or two. Another SmartApp is SmartTiles which lets you create a web-based dashboard to control the devices & see the status of your sensors outside of the SmartThings App. I use an old Android phone as a controller in the family room.

The smartapps marketplace is a total mess which is hard to navigate and find the right application to make certain functions work.\n\nWe already have devices like Nest Thermostat, Nest Protect, Ring and Rachio at home - however these are all unsupported. A few devices like Nest you can make work through some 3rd party code in the IDE but there is no native integration. Some might work with very limited functionalities through an IFTTT channel.\n\nThe support is very unresponsive and could not solve any issues I came across in a reasonable time (3 working days).\n\nHowever, I was impressed by flexibility of the IDE and some user generated applications like the RuleMachine and some other integrations. Unfortunately, it seems that this flexibility comes with a high instability of the system.\n\nRecommendations for SmartThings/Samsung: 1) Fix your cloud system, right now your product is unusable. 2) Hire some good engineers and UX designers and fix your app, its UI is outdated and the stability is ridiculous. The functions are very setup driven and not use case driven 3) Partner with more major IoT/Smarthome manufacturers."}

ST seemed to fit the bill. First off none of the sensors that Comcast provided work with ST, even though they use a \"compatible\" protocol. I chalk that up to Comcast being d$%ks (no surprise there) to ensure people would not do what I am doing. Anyway, that issue is not Samsung's fault so I don't blame them for that. What I do blame them for is their horrible app, which by their own admission does not work correctly for home security (an issue that has lingered for more than a year as far as I can tell). If their Smart Home Monitor app worked it would display a nice arm home, arm away and disarm on the main dashboard of the ST app. The system is easy to add sensors, etc and seems at first glance to be great. Then, you know, you arm the system. Then you try to disarm the system, well that is where this product falls apart. You CAN'T disarm the alarm, so guess what you have to chat with tech support to turn it off!!! Think I am making this up go to status.smartings.com and see for yourself.\n\nOk, so after hours dealing with their tech support and revising their forums, other users said to use a 3rd party app call Smart Alarm. This app can be installed within the Samsung app (yes confusing) and actually is much better than the Samsung SHM app. Problem is Samsung, to be d's decided only their own apps can be on the dashboard so if you use a 3rd party app you are relegated to unnecessarily indirect ways of using them. So, after setting the SA app, everything seemed OK. At this point I would have just complained about how bad the SHM app is and gave this thing 3 stars but no it gets worse.\n\nYou see everything in SmartThings is not controlled on your hub, it is controlled in the cloud. Normally, this would be fine, I got a fast connection to internet, and I am used to Apple/Google \"it just works\" level of service. Nope, Samsung apparently cheaped out in the cloud, so this system is constantly going down or acting in funny ways. What prompted me to write this scathing review was that I armed the system, went to lunch and when I got home I could not disarm the system!! Yes, their servers are down, got a email from them telling me. That is great but when their servers are down I cannot disarm the system!! So I have to go into my house pull the siren and bury it under pillows (it is sealed with a internal battery and no off switch).\n\nSo here I am, I spent north of $600 on this crap and don't know what to do. I don't see another system that can do what this system does. I really wish Apple was further along with HomeKit or I would have never bought this stuff. I always stuck with Apple products because I always felt that the Samsung stuff was inferior, this experience has solidified my belief. I will NEVER buy a Samsung product again."}

Went right back to SmartThings!", "Text": "I have tried quite a few hubs out there, and every time I come back to ST. Here's my experience of the good and the bad... However, the good heavily outweighs the bad, just as I recommend SmartThings over other hubs like vera or wink.\n\nI purchased my ST after initially purchased a VeraEdge controller and was disappointed in the slow interface, lack of zigbee support, and unreliable ui vera had. I ordered the SmartThings and with not really much of an idea how powerful it was... Initially I was impressed with the easy setup and compatibility, and since (with a little help from an amazing online community creating custom device types that the company supports) If it didn't natively work with ST, I could locate a custom device type quickly and get it installed. It's compatible with the 2nd gen Iris sensors which you can catch on sale for a good deal. Since purchasing, the integration and compatibility has become better and better!\n\nThe interface does have its drawbacks, as all hubs do i've found, and one of then is the UI. The device is designed to be home AUTOMATION not home control with a remote/mobile phone. Because it aids in true automation (where little interaction is required from the user) there's only an interface for android and iphone's designed to give you quick info and help you install devices. There's no ipad app and no a web ui (minus the IDE, for installing custom device types and apps). This makes it a little difficult for guest that come over. There are some 3rd party dashboards that I've integrated and have been fairly happy with such, but wish there was a native web ui. Also, the hub is pretty much rendered useless if your internet connection fails... This is an extreme rarity or myself with a backup internet connection, but could be problematic if you have internet that gets spotty. Lastly, like all the other hubs, a couple of the smartapps native to SmartThings are a little spotty, I occasionally. have issues with arrivals and departures (but not sure if that's an issue with Apple Location Services or the app itself)\n\nBecause of these problems, I decided to try the new VERAPLUS I've been seeing all over the internet... BIG MISTAKE! The only issue that wouldn't necessarily arise with Vera over ST is the internet connectivity but that was a minor improvement. Vera does not natively support near the number of devices nor have I found a simple way to \"add custom device types\" so to speak. The Zigbee integration is horribly unstable, rendering the device useless if it has issues configuring a zigbee device (which is frequent) The Web UI is a NIGHTMARE slow and unreliable and support is not prompt at all.\n\nI had an issues with my ST hub where the power wasn't working. I contacted support, and with a couple 3 emails back and forth and with some troubleshooting, I had a new hub express delivered to me no charge to replace it. They including a return label and told me to pack the old one in the box, slapped the label on and call UPS. The support request took about 6 hours to respond, and sent the replacement within 48 hours of the initial request. I contacted VERA support and it took them 8 days to respond to my support request, and after 2 weeks of trying to get a response by email, I gave up. They blamed they're tarty reply on a bug in they're filtering software (the reason why i was contacting them was because my garage door kept opening and closing in the night because of vera).\n\nOverall, in my opinion ST is an increasingly reliable, cost friendly/affordable, easy to install and configure, all in one Home Automation hub that I HIGHLY recommend to anyone wanting home automation. Each update brings better and better improvements, and an increasing number of happy home user's continue to help their online community grow stronger and stronger with new, innovative ways to incorporate home automation in your life. And that makes my life much simpler!"}

I then added 2 more sensors, another hour to pair. Next I ran into range issues with the 2 sensors so I purchased a switch so I would have a repeater, spent hours trying to get them connected and it never did. I then tried another switch, nope, won't connect. Finally I got the 3rd switch to pair, I installed it. Now the sensors that need the switch (repeater) as a \"parent\" in order to talk to the hub won't reconfigure. This system is a bust at this point.

I had selected it due to its compatibility with a number of devices that I already own: Ecobee3, wemo switches, netatmo weatherstation, sonos speaker. I thought that having a hub would make life simpler. It turns out this thing is junk. It has done nothing but frustrate me in the three weeks I have had it. Today I printed the return label and it is going back to Amazon. For those of you looking to buy one, I have listed out the specific issues I have had. My only advice: buyer beware!\n\n1. It is not actually compatible with Ecobee3. The website still says its compatible. As I was first setting up the device, Ecobee3 does not come up as a device I could connect to. When I google I find that there indeed isn't an app to connect it and I would have to \"donate\" to some random person on the internet to get code to connect it?! These didn't seem reasonable, so I emailed customer service. He told me to just select a different ecobee thermostat and that it would find it. I guess he was right, because it did connect, but it only stayed connected a couple days before it gave me an error that my credentials were incorrect - even though they hadn't changed. That is when I gave up on thermostat functionality.\n2. Then there was the lights. For the first week, there was a issue with the time. I had lights going on at all hours even though I only had a rule to turn them on at sunset, which at the time was ~5:45 here in CT. I had to delete all my rules and reinstall them before it would function as I wanted.\n3. Then my wemo switches lost connection. They worked fine for about a week and then they appeared offline. I could still go into the Wemo app to turn the lights on and off, so they are certainly \"online\". But I couldn't turn them on or off with the SmartThings app and they were not turning on and off with my scheduled routines. Again, I emailed customer support. After going back and forth twice with him and still not able to connect them I gave up. It just wasn't worth it!\n4. I had it connected to my sonos speakers. As part of my routines, it was supposed to read me the weather for the next day at bed time. This worked for the first week or so, but hasn't been working the last few days. I also mentioned this to customer support and his only suggestion was that they had to be on the same network to work. Well of course they are on the same network! When I mentioned this in my second email to him, he just ignored it.\n5. Then there was a few days in a row when I couldn't even open the app. It kept giving me an error message that there was an internet connection issue even though I still had complete functionality on other apps and other people in the house could open the app on their phone."}

On their website it states that they offer live chat support, but it turns out that due to the overwhelming demand for their support, they have disabled live chat support as well. So the only way to reach them is via email which typically takes them 2 days to get back to you and thats only if you are persistent with following up with them. On top of that, the actual support you receive will make you want to pull your hair out. I couldn't connect my cameras to my wifi signal so they gave me some bogus instructions on how to do it and after going back and forth for about a week, I gave up on Samsung's support and called D Link camera's support and they helped me figure it out on the spot.

It's been one heck of a journey.\n\nQuick comparison, it's much easier to use than Vera, more powerful and flexible than Wink. Overall the possibilities with this hub is endless.\n\nThe best way to describe the experience with SmartThings is AWESOME! Awe as in the power of what it can do but at the same time it needs a lot of handholding. Think of it as building blocks to build your dream home and futuring experience. You can do a bunch of simple things like remotely locking your door, programming your thermostat, checking for open door/windows, water leaks etc. That's the basic stuff. However if you really want to excel at this you' can have an AWESOME experience but you'll need some hand holding and help to get there. Unfortunately while SmartThings is just the platform you can find a VERY active helpful community to help you get what you want from this.\n\nSo after tinkering with this for over two years a few of us decided to get together an create a bunch of Apps that allow you to extract the most out of this SmartThings hub. All you need a bunch of Z-Wave devices like Schlage Connect Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt with Built-In Alarm, Satin Nickel, BE469 CAM 619, Garage Door Controller like GoControl/Linear GD00Z-4 Z-Wave Garage Door Opener Remote Controller, Small, Black Monoprice Z-Wave motion sensors for about 21 bucks, Ecolink Z-Wave Door/Window Sensor (DWZWAVE2-ECO) and maybe things like a Z-Wave Water Sensor or even WiFi Cameras like Foscam FI9821P Plug & Play Megapixel 1.0 Megapixel 1280 x 720 Wireless/Wired Pan/Tilt IP Camera with IR-Cut (Black) or the All New Fabulous Battery Operated Blink Camera (Blink Smart Home HD Monitor & Alert System, 100% Wire-Free - 1 Camera). Once you have these basics here are a few things you can do:\n1. When you and the family leave the house, the garage door closes, the doors lock up, the lights turn off, the thermostats change to eco settings and you get a confirmation that all doors/windows are closed and locked! It also arms the security system and turns on the camera to detect for motion.\n2. When a family member comes home, it disarms the security system, opens your garage door and unlocks your front door.\n3. If your family comes into town or you have a friend coming over, you can remotely create a lock code for them to use. When use it, the door unlocks, security system disarms, the audio system greets them by name, the camera takes a picture and send it to you to confirm they're arrived home safely.\n4. If there's a water leak in the house, it sets off the alarm, send you a message and turns off the mains to the house (yes it can do that!!) so there's no flodding\n5. If it's a cloudy day it can turn on the lights automatically inside the house, when the sun comes out it turns them off, in the evening it turns it on automatically and shuts everything down when you goto bed\n\nThese are some of the apps we have written to make the most out of this platform and hub. Overall it's a VERY powerful and flexible platform but if you aren't a programmer start with the community for help or visit the RBoy Apps website at www-rboyapps-com to see what you can get done to make your House Your Butler!\n\nEnjoy!!!\n\nPS - I've given it 4 stars, as much as we love this platform, is because you will need some help to make the most out of it, but truly once you're figure it out, Google NEST will look like a historical artifact!"}

Having said that, there were a lot of issues when I first purchased the Gen 2 hub (I preordered it from the ST website and received it shortly after release). The devices I bought with the hub paired fine and they functioned properly but I'd get random notifications that the hub was offline then back online a couple minutes later.\n\nST pushed out an update to the hub a couple months ago that has made the experience *vastly* better. The hub is no longer going offline randomly and everything seems to be working as it should.\n\nThe best part is easily the integration with the Amazon Echo. Being able to control my lights and devices with just my voice is not only cool but convenient as well. No more having to take out my phone and go into the app to manually change something that isn't set on a schedule. It also integrates well with the Harmony Hub, so I can turn my TV and other media devices on/off with just my voice.\n\nAs far as I can tell, everything still processes in the cloud, so I'm hoping that they open up the local processing to developers soon. I've got cellular backup on my primary internet, so I'm not too worried about the cloud integration now.\n\nOverall, things were initially a bit rough but after the major update a month or so ago things have been fantastic. It's not perfect, and anyone whose leery of the cloud should look elsewhere, but overall it's been a very good center for my home automation needs."}

Maybe that's why I can't any app instruction.\n- The menu is terribly designed, it made me to read through the whole menu to find the download link for the apps\n- To activate the hub you need a code, but it took me 5+ attempts to get through (I emailed support and took them 2 days to email me just a case # (no solutions)\n\n- There are absolutely no instructions on how to use the app ( the menu that came with the box only shows you how to setup the hardware)\n- This hub only works specific brand and MODEL I guess. Make sure you buy the most expensive brand (specific Wemo) and check out their compatible list .. haha\n\nExtra info::\nWait for gen 3 or something, gen 2 is for lab rats!\n\nSwitches:\nSurprisingly, the cheapest brand ==> Ankuoo NEO works the best for me and their app load the fastest and response really quick but the draw back is, it doesn't work with Amazon Echo. Wemo is the worst and the most expensive, you can pour coffee or turn on and off 10 times physically while waiting (20s for single switch) for the app to load and scan for switches. TP-Link has reasonable price and the app has good response time (way better than Wemo) and it's compatible with Echo w/o hub.. Woohoo..! Not so fast, TP-link only makes \"smart plug\", they don't make switches. You can only buy TP for plug in devices, no ceiling lights or any appliance uses \"wall switch\"\n\n2016/03/19\nJust received my Wemo light switch which is on SmarThings' compatible list. Still no luck getting it to conncet to any of my smart plug/switches. I am returning it. Good luck!"}

Rarely I will run into a problem where the hub simply doesn't respond to commands. This was particularly bad for 3 days. It was simply an inconvenience but it could have been worse had I owned the garage door opener, thermostat or door locks. I believe this is a server issue on Samsungs end and nothing I could do alleviated the problem. It only does this now during the occasional 10 minute maintenance update.

I\u2019ve had the pleasure of having my smart-home completely down from them making changes remotely. You\u2019ll become a master at repairing your Z-network, putting your devices in exclusion mode, putting your hub in exclusion mode, completely re-adding and configuring every device in your house to troubleshoot something Samsung broke. I\u2019ve had my system working 100% for weeks at a time, until Samsung touches it, then its broke and needs days of work to repair it, if it ever works again. I\u2019m currently stuck with all my thermostats down and Samsung can\u2019t do a thing to fix it because they don\u2019t know what they broke with the last update. You current customers know what I\u2019m talking about, the emails every month \u201cGood news we found something wrong with your smarthub, it only affects a few people (aka everyone) so we\u2019re going to apply a fix and reboot your unit this Wednesday\u201d.\nSo you want to put your faith in this unit for home security, flood protection, locking your doors, controlling temperature. You\u2019ll enjoy when your flood sensor says \u201ceverything is dry, battery 100%\u201d. And later you realize after water\u2019s on the floor, the batteries have been dead for weeks but Samsung still shows it as 100% functional. It\u2019s really become a joke in my house. Garage door up all the time, no problem come and enter my house because this unit will never trigger the alarm. Don\u2019t forget your keys because your automated door locks won\u2019t work when you need them to. I\u2019ve spent $1000\u2019s of dollars on devices that for all intense and purpose, I might as well throw in the garbage because Samsung smarthub makes them useless. I have cameras that will go offline in the smarthub, but will work perfectly with any other software tool, then magically work after a few days.\nThe support staff are nice, I know all them now very well, even what days and shifts they work. Unfortunately they all do the same thing over and over again without success, reboot, add, remove, zwave repair, etc. Nothing ever gets fixed until the next month\u2019s forced updates from Samsung (after they realized whatever mistakes they made with the previous update).\nThis was a great concept that has failed miserably in execution. I\u2019ll try any other vendor at this point.\n\n***Update 6/12/2016***\nI'm raising up to 4 stars from 1. Samsung has made alot of updates, almost monthly and my system is functioning about 100% of the time. I purchased some zwave repeaters and they solved alot of my issues. I have the smarthub in the basement, and it was acting sporadic with updating my devices. Once I installed the repeaters in the basement, 1st floor, and 2nd floor of my house, my sporadic issues went away. I've added more LED lights, fire alarms, motion detectors, and everything is working great to be honest, no complaints. I'll happily raise to 5-stars if this level maintains for a few more months.

My biggest complaint right now is the fact that it goes offline for absolutely no reason at all in the middle of the night. I've had the device around 2 weeks and it's gone completely offline twice. A full reboot is necessary. This requires using a pin to push the reset button on the back for several seconds. Those of you who don't have one yet are probably thinking \"that's not THAT big of a deal!\". Well, yes, yes it is. If you are using your hub to control your lights as an alarm clock? It's a problem. If your hub controls your front door lock? It's a problem. If it controls all your lights in general? It's a problem! Shutting off the light switch to these smart bulbs can cause them to lose connectivity and need to be readded to the hub. That's a real hassle. Especially when you have 10 or so fixtures all relying on this technology. I have mine connected to my Amazon Echo and have Alexa turn things on and off. The Echo hasn't lost connectivity a single time. But if the hub is offline, Alexa cannot command any of the connected devices on it's own.\nMy next complaint is the app. Good Lord. I'm an IT professional and this app stresses me out. This is Beta level at best. For a consumer level device, the app should be simple, straightforward, and JUST WORK. Samsung's expectations that anyone who would use/want this technology has ANY familiarity with IFTTT and the like, is just unrealistic. Frankly, when I'm done working for the day, the last thing I want to do is go home and DO MORE WORK! The fact that I've opened 3 support tickets in less than 2 weeks for a CONSUMER DEVICE is obnoxious.\nOn that note. I do have to say their customer service is EXCELLENT. Otherwise, this would be 1 star.\nI'm giving this device until the end of the return policy, but if there's no improvement after that, I'm going to have to go with a different device.

The open source apps and ability to add custom 'things' to your network along with no monthly fees is what made the sale. I also already had a foscam wireless camera and this hub had a community made app that allowed them to work together instead of me having to buy a new camera. Neat.\n\nAnyway~ I opened it up, followed the directions to a T, and everything worked instantly. Well, it took about 5 minutes to download a software update but when that was done, it worked instantly. From the gps phone locator that turns things on when I arrive or leave home, the messages and status about your 'things', the easy to follow app to set your 'routines'... simple. If you can read and follow a recipe, there is no reason you can't make this work. I figured out my old fridge is an energy hog, more so than the lights I always forget to turn off at night.\n\nMy only complaint is that I have an older iphone 4, and if I don't leave the app running sometimes it doesn't automatically know when I return 'home' and I have to click the routine manually. I think this is a problem with my phone and not the software though, and they do make little transponders that are supposed to be more accurate than the phone geolocator.\n\nRight now I just have the camera and some on/off switches for lights, and since it all works I will be adding in more soon. This is a great way to monitor the status of your home or business from your phone, and automatically turn on/off lights and security when you come and go.\n\nI don't think I would substitute this for a monthly-fee hard-wired security system that sounds an alarm and calls the cops or fire dept just yet, mainly because if your phone rings and you left it in the car or didn't notice it vibrate, and didn't check and notice it was going off until lunch time... it could be ineffective. I know I know, there are apps and services that let it do all that, but the main weakness in the system is actually your phone and your ability to instantly view notifications.\n\nI can see once they get this more... idiot proof... that insurance companies and fire departments would WANT people to include these in homes. Knowing when fire alarms and carbon monoxide detectors are going off can save lives, but because 90% of the time they are just false alarms that will be the part they need to work through next from their end.\n\nBasic home security, safety, energy monitoring, hvac control, and turning lights on/off when you come and go, and camera triggered photos and lights/alarms. I have mine set up as a wakeup alarm by turning on my lights when the sun comes up in the morning. Neat.\n\nLooking forward to seeing how these progress, and the open source nature of Samsung SmartThings makes it fun."}

Despite this the \"Goodbye\" routine has not executed for 5 hrs despite it having a trigger to execute when \"Everyone leaves\" and the definition of \"everyone\" is mine and my wife's phones. On some days it executes, on others it does not. Nothing is changing in the setup and the connectivity of the ST hub, it just seems to have a mind of its own. Door sensor status sometimes is updated correctly and sometimes not. I bought a panic button to mount on my wife's night stand so she has some way of triggering a siren at night when I am away in the unlikely event of an intrusion. When I test the button sometimes it triggers an even and sometimes it does not. And that is with the button less than 10 ft from the hub and the router that the hub is connected to. In other words the system is completely unsuitable to manage a DYI security setup in your home. I cannot trust it to automatically trigger a siren because I can't trust it to trigger when it has to, and equally importantly I cannot trust it to NOT trigger when it should not. The ONLY thing the system is good for at this time is \"for fun\" applications, such as sending out an \"alarm\" when my wife's phone returns within the geofencing range, speaking \"hello gorgeous\" through the Sonos when the front door opens, turn lights on/off when we are away, or control the garden fountain. For anything else where frequent failure is not an option look elsewhere. So far I have about $200 invested in the setup and am still debating whether to write it off as a total loss or hope for the best over time. Based on my experience so far I sure am not buying any more z-wave devices. These things are still fairly pricey, and if they don't work properly what is the point?"}

I live in a smart house which was built with a Nexia Z-wave system installed on locks and some light switches. The Nexia hub required a monthly service fee for access. I bought the SmartThings hub because I wanted to avoid monthly fees for my home automation, but it has given me so much more functionality than I had with my Nexia system. Setting it up was mostly effortless. The hub discovered most of my switches, locks, and thermostats with no problem. It discovered the one sensor that it initially couldn't find when I varied the timing of when I pushed the discover button on the sensor in the discovery process. The hub was compatible with all the devices in my home, and it has easily discovered new devices I have purchased since I learned about the increased functionality of the hub. I especially appreciate that SmartThings has it's own IFTTT channel for very specific automation menus, as well as compatibility with Amazon's Echo device. Teaming the SmartThings hub with Echo makes the whole home voice actuated. Very cool! The hub is also compatible with my Harmony Ultimate remote hub, so I can even control my audio/video system with voice commands using the Echo to direct the SmartThings hub to direct the Harmony remote. The cool thing is that everything is accessible from the single SmartThings app on my phone. I do not have to constantly switch between apps like I used to. No more switching between the Philips Hue Light app, Harmony, and Nexia the way I used to.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that the SmartThings hub has truly integrated all the smart devices in my home as none other I know of could. One reason is that Samsung has a very enthusiastic SmartThings development team who is developing new uses and expanding compatible devices each month. I learn about the new features through a newsletter they send monthly. My only disappointment is that the hub is only compatible with one Samsung model of security cam. I have two Samsung cams that are not compatible and hope that the development team will write compatibility for my models into the software soon. In summary, I think this hub is the best on the market, requires no monthly service fee, and is getting better each month."}

I will try to summarize as best as possible. I think the product does work very well, but it's not quite perfect. If the hub were just a little more reliable I would say 5 stars for sure.\n\nI'm using the hub for home security/monitoring.\nHave about 10 devices on the hub: Door/Window sensors, motion sensors, alarm, water leak sensor\n\nSetup: I found the hub very easy to setup and configure, this was something I was very pleased with. Reading different reviews it sounded like people were having major issues with the hub and the smartphone application to configure/run it. I didn't have any of these experiences. I thought everything was very easy to get up and running for my purpose, and adding new sensors was painless. 5 stars for that\n\nFeatures: I think out of the box the hub does have most of the standard features/programs built in that someone would need. Obviously if you wanted to get more in depth with your automation some custom scripting will be necessary. Overall the smart phone application allowed me to easily configure everything that I wanted from the system so far.\n\nOperation: Overall I think it runs very well. I had one update pushed from Samsung that required a reboot, that was all. Otherwise I haven't had to try and reset/reboot the hub at all. I have sensors all over different levels of my house, attached garage, and an out building. The outbuilding is probably 100' from the hub or more and no issues seeing my sensors.\n\nReliability: This is the one spot where ST just isn't quite there yet. Randomly things just don't quite work, like my daily routines. I've reached out to Samsung on those, and they responded promptly but don't have the problems fixed yet. I've had a few devices give me false positives, and my alarm got stuck on at one point briefly. These are more issues with the devices themselves, and not so much the hub. I think if they can get the features within the hub to run just a little more consistently this will be the perfect solution.\n\nOverall: Very happy with this setup. I use it for home security/monitoring and it works very well. For the cost to setup, and the fact I have no monthly monitoring fees makes this a great value to me. I will continue to add a few more sensors over time, and hopefully it continues to be a success."}

No. What's happened is that the back end servers are overwhelmed with traffic causing scheduled events to not happen about as often as they happen.\n\nThis is all the result of a boneheaded (or worse, malicious) decision to make all scheduling require use of a centralized server. That's right, every time ANY SmartThings user *all over the world* has a desire to schedule an event as simple as turning on a light, this requires communicating with a centralized server for it to work. Now, why would they do something so stupid? Was it so they could charge subscription fees down the road once a bunch of people were \"hooked\"? Was it to datamine people's habits for profit?

The V2 offers promise but only time will tell if they can remain a player in this popular techy space. My basic characterization of the V2 is that is an immature product but they did get some things right.\nLikes: My main reason for moving from a stable Vera3 platform was the Smartthings integration with Amazon Echo. It works really well and for the most part I'm happy I made the switch. Once I learned to disassociate my devices from the Vera3 hub during migration I found the migration to be a piece of cake for standard switches, plugs etc.. Price is reasonable compared with competitive products and Samsung's names suggests innovation and integration into more of their suite of products.\nDislikes: Immature & not reliable. My Vera 3 was bulletproof in comparison. I got so frustrated with having to reboot the ST V2 hub to address the \"Hub is offline\" problems that I re-commissioned the Vera3 to control the power to the V2 so I could remotely reboot it. The battery backup is useless to me because of this reliability problem. The apps environment is oriented towards programmers and so far there isn't a very solid base of solutions. Most of the basic functionality like thermostat controls and door lock access management requires searching for other people's custom scripts and learning the Software Development Environment in order to access the apps. Lack of PC (Windows for me) control interface is bothersome. If not for the Amazon Echo I'd have to reach for my phone to control everything which is annoying given that I have a laptop in front of me most of the time.\n\nSummary: The main reason for me to stay on the Smartthings platform is for the Amazon Echo integration. Time will tell whether or not I stay with this platform. If Samsung can improve the Smartthings reliability and applications/solutions platform before Vera Control has a robust integration with Echo then I'll probably leave things the way they are but Vera's platform and solutions suite is much more mature."}

Now it\u2019s time to get out continuous beta mode and actually build something that actually enables the consumer to solve their problems. The primary problems with Smartthings can be summed up pretty easily. In summary: (1) The phone interface needs a lot of user experience work. (2) The website controller interface is not easy to navigate and doesn\u2019t add a lot of additional features. (3) Buying a new device to solve a problem is not straightforward (#1 question on Amazon: Does this work with SmartThings?) (4) There is no way to update device firmware via SmartThings that I can find. That\u2019s a security issue. (5) Changing simple device parameters to allow you to customize basic things (like increase/decrease a dimmer rate, turn off or on a load sensing feature on a plug-in) require programming skills. (6) There needs to be far better if/then functionality. (Example: if sensor B is tripped, then X, Y and Z.) IFTTT is not the way to do this elegantly, it simply should not be that hard to integrate this kind of functionality directly into the Samsung interface.\n\nIn short, the system is kind of stuck between two worlds: it is marketed as a consumer product but requires hacking/programming skills to make it indispensable or in some cases, useful. One thing Samsung seems to have missed: I live in a house with a wife and a child. I wanted the system. I set it up. I like it and know its quirks and shortcomings. My wife, on the other hand, wants to throw it in the trash. Why? Because she does not want to learn how to operate a light switch on SmartThings, she wants the darn light to turn on and off (you know, like it always did before SmartThings).\n\nThere are two other worlds that SmartThings is stuck in as well. On one hand, it\u2019s this great multi-protocol, multi-platform, bring your own device kind of solution that would be awesome if they actually leaned into that with consumer-centric,intuitive interfaces. On the other hand, it is kind of a Samsung Zigbee solution marketed with this pathetically small collection of Samsung devices that happens to sort of support a ton of Z-Wave and compatible 3rd party Zigbee devices. Samsung needs to decide \u2013 do they want to give the user a consumer-centric closed system that simply works out of the box, or an open system that is relatively easy to troubleshoot and customize, because right now it is sort of neither for the average consumer.

I've been losing internet a couple times a week for several weeks and sometimes 2-3 times in a day. EVERY one of my devices comes back online without human intervention EXCEPT the Smartthings hub. Every time I have an internet problem I have to physically reset the Smartthings hub before it starts working again. There's no way of resetting it remotely. It requires a button to be pushed at the hub. So once it's down you have to make a trip to wherever your hub is to do the reset before it starts working again. Everything else on my network runs flawlessly. Wehn the internet has a hiccup everything else just comes up without any problems. I suggest doing a google search on \"Smartthings V2 unreliability\" and see whet pops up. Many other users are having reliability issues."}

We had been using the VeraLite for about a year before purchasing the Samsung Smartthings. The VeraLite seemed a little slow, and there was always a delay if you would send commands through the app. Our house has about 25 Leviton switches and dimmers and three Leviton VRCS4-M0Z Vizia RF + 4-Button Remote Scene Controller. These scene controllers are key to the entire operation. My wife is never going to use a phone to turn lights off, and as I said, we have a lot of lights in the system. With theses controllers, she can hit one button and every light that she needs to cook dinner is suddenly lit. The VeraLite worked very well with these controllers; it was just a little slow through the app.\n\nThe Samsung Smartthings controller cannot operate or, more importantly, program these or ANY scene controller. The only way to turn on multiple lights at one time is to go through the app. There are no scene controllers on the market that will work with ST. I contacted support, and they told me to check out the Smartthings community. They were basically telling me that they didn't know and didn't care. I had already looked at the community postings (obviously), and I had even installed an app that was supposed to work with these scene controllers. The app did work some, but the button pushes would have to send a message back to the controller, and then the controller would send messages to all of the lights. This would take about 1 minute. With the Vera, the button push sends the message straight from the scene controller to all of the lights, so the scene changes happen instantaneously.\n\nMaybe my unhappiness with this lack of scene controller functionality seems nit picky, but this is a core function of many automation systems. You should not buy this thinking that the home brewed app available on the Smartthings Community forum is going to work the way you want. It absolutely will not work the way you are thinking!!!\n\nAll that aside, the main reason we were shopping around was that the VeraLite seemed a little slow. After you use the Smartthings for a month, the VeraLite will feel like a supercomputer. The problem is that so many of the commands just fail. Sometimes you can't tell if it is just taking so long because it is thinking or because it just gave up. The last straw was our outdoor lights. With the Vera and Smartthings, they were set to come on every night at sunset. In about 25 attempts, the Smartthings only turned the lights on about 20 times. This is a very simple operation, that never failed even once with the Vera.\n\nSo ultimately, we returned the Smartthings and we replaced it with a VeraEdge. It works just like the VeraLite but is noticeably faster. I wasted so much time un-pairing and re-pairing, then un-pairing and re-pairing all of my lights and controllers (literally 3 full days). I made a terrible mistake! Please don't make the same mistake."}

I've read a lot of complaints here about set up but I experienced no issues and it went quickly. The app does suck though, it's not hard to use but it's not good, can't explain it, just not smooth.... The system works perfectly for me until smart things updates the hub. I found this out because I checked it in the app and it said it was not working. I looked on a forum online and they said the hub was just updated and many others were having the same issue. When updates come from smart things the hub needs to be reset and restarted at the hub, it doesn't restart automatically apparently. Im not sure why they would design it like this. For someone like me who uses this remotely it makes it basically useless. On the forum some gurus where saying this could be solved by having another brands hub control the smart things hub. Then use the other brands hub to restart the smart things hub. Are you kidding me? Really? This is just not acceptable. Btw I made the 4 hour trip cause I needed to go anyway. I reset the hub and it worked perfectly again for a month, the next update killed it again. So like I said I really want to love it but I just cant. As updates keep coming it will continue to stop working. If it were where I live I might have no issues but since I can't drive 4 hours each way to turn it on its an expensive paperweight.

Ever since I got this system, there's always something to fix. It is not only me, the whole SmartThings community gets these \"outages\" as well. Staff recognizes there is some problem and then they try to fix it and sometimes it may last for days or even weeks. Last thing that made me decide to throw this away was that I reached out to support for help on my schedules not working, and I ended up getting three different e-mails, at three different times that said the SAME thing. It was so clear that it was a template because on one of the e-mails, the support guy didn't even bother to change the name to whom it was addressed.\n\nIf you want automation from time to time, and have enough time to tinker with in a weekly or so basis, go for this. If you are thinking of getting a Plug and Play and Forget device, move along.\n\n*** UPDATE 03/23/2016 ***\nOkay, so now I have decided to lower my rating to 1 star. This is just something that I can neither justify nor recommend to anyone. After the last problems 2 months ago, things eventually got \"fixed\", and I say \"fixed\" because it started to behave stable-ish, but at the cost of much of the platform's power. For example, the Smart Home Monitor, which is Samsung's idea of monetizing SmartThings by partnering with security systems like Scout, has never worked perfectly. I had about two months of my lights and rest of my setup giving me little to no trouble, but there was nothing complex running.\n\nThis was until a week ago. SmartThings has had an outage of its platform, degrading the performance of it and rendering you unable to control devices through the app. As of the moment of this writing, the SmartThings platform has been having problems for over 12 days, without a fix in sight. People in the community forum are outraged by this, and some have even sent e-mails to Samsung's CEO, which eventually led to SmartThing's CEO to show his face on the forum to communicate with the users.\nIt is unacceptable for a company that promotes this item as a security monitoring device, which actually earns money by monthly subscriptions with security companies, to have an outage of more than a day. Before you even think of purchasing this hub, think if you would like your security company to go deaf to your house for 12 days.\n\nThis is just a toy. A very expensive one, for that matter, because by itself it does nothing. You need to start buying other stuff, which will quickly start to add up to the thousands of dollars. STAY AWAY FROM THIS."}

The issue was not closed until mid-January, with no real resolution, just a workaround. Turns out the hub cannot figure out time zone differences if the mobile app is used in a different time zone, even when you program the location into the hub. I would wait between 3-4 days up to over 10 days to get a response from their technical support team. A couple of days ago, I checked in with the mobile app and found that none of lights were turning on at the programmed time. I went into the online app and, after routing around, found that the devices were hung waiting for an event trigger that was three days in the past. I ended up reprogramming all the switches to clear the issue. And to add insult to injury, I got a smoke detected alarm last weekend. I immediately sent my neighbor over to check the house....no smoke. All day long, I kept getting reminders about the event with no obvious way the clear the condition. Once again, I logged into my account online and found no events related to the alarm in any of the event logs and the status of the device was \"clear.\" So, I got a false alarm...grateful I didn't call the fire department and get socked with a false alarm fee.\n\nI am pretty much out of patience with the unreliability of this product and the now continual issues.

One tip: for devices you really do need to work correctly, such as smoke alarms and perhaps security cameras, keep those separate from SmartThings. Use SmartThings as your sometimes functioning door/window/motion alerts, but use something more reliable for your smoke detectors and security cameras."}
{"Author": "ab33b3", "Date": "on January 21, 2016", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Does not work reliably or consistently", "Text": "I was very excited about the potential of the smarthub, but have been disappointed with it's poor reliability. I wanted a relatively simple switch to turn lights and electrical switches on and off at certain times or when the sun rises and sets. While I have been mostly able to set these things up, they don't *stay* set up. I would find that I would have to delete and re-add devices on a weekly basis to get them to keep doing what they were set up to do. I have gotten really tired of waking up in the morning to find lights that were supposed to turn themselves off were, in fact, still on. At the same time, the set up is complicated and time-consuming enough that resetting everything on a bi-weekly basis is a pain in the butt.\n\nWhile many people seem happy with the ability to extend the way the hub works with custom code from the online community, that is a level beyond where I wanted to go to get things to work. I found the 'macro' language to be kludgey and inefficient. For example to turn a light on at Sunset, and then turn it off the same night at 11:30, the user has to set up two 'rules'\n\nThe device does enough of what it is supposed to do that I did not return it before the 30 days was up, but I do not think it is ready for prime time. At this point, I would absolutely NOT count on the hub to do anything more important than fiddling with lights. Based on the lack of reliability and consistancy I have experienced, I think anyone expecting it to alert you to a leaking hot water heater or broken pipe might be very disappointed."}

Entirely thanks to smartthings. They have had bugs like every other available hub but the versatility and potential of this hub far exceeds its price point. At the time of this writing, there is occasional unreliability so I wont rely on it for security just yet, but for monitoring/automating my house (thermostat, lights, detectors/sensors, power, etc) it does that great. I've linked it with IFTTT, and amazon Echo. The community development is really the best part. Smarttiles.click is one really cool advantage. Rule Machine is another. When you compare it to other systems out there, you can do more with smartthings at the best price point. If you want cheaper/easier, look at wink. If you want more expensive/harder theres lots of options. But despite its drawbacks, the winner of the homeautomation hubs is currently Smartthings."}

{"Author": "Sammy", "Date": "on January 18, 2016", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Only a Hobby Item at This Stage", "Text": "First, This review is not version specific. I have the SmartThings Hub v1and 20 devices connected to it. I purchased it shortly before SmartThings v2 was quietly released. At this point in time, both of these hubs are strictly for the hobbyist and should not be relied on for any real security. That being said, I love the idea of the SmartThings and Z-Wave technology.\n\nThe Hub: Now on version 2, neither one of these hubs is beyond beta. In other words, they rushed these things out and neither of them is complete. Most people on V1 as I am have invested hours in setting devices up just to find out they released a V2. However, there is no way to migrate to V2. In fact, moving from v1 to v2 requires much more work than the original setup because you have to remove every SmartApp and every device from the old hub before they will join the new one. The only comparison I can make to this is, let\u2019s say you accidently delete a document like the one I am typing here. Instead of having to retype it again, you would have to un-type it first. Meaning you would first have to type the document backwards, letter by letter and then type it forward again. It is the most ridiculous migration of anything I have ever seen and I have been in the IT world for a very long time. Other small issues are; it often requires a power reset to make it do something simple like add or delete a device or change a value.\n\nThe App: Nothing can be done on the SmartThings platform without either an iOS or Android app. Note, as of today these are only mobile phone apps. There is no iPad, Tablet, Web, Windows or Mac apps. If you don\u2019t have a smart phone you cannot use this product. While there is a web GUI for some backend programming features, all of the functionality including adding and deleting devices, creating system events, controlling devices and monitoring security are all done through the phone app. The completely unintuitive app has gone through several major updates, all of which are confusing and sometimes confounding. There seems to be no logic to most of the functions. Even though SmartThings is owned by Samsung, it seems like they have a 17-year-old kid programming the app and writing code as he figures out something was missing. I picture this kids room with clothes piled up high on the floor and candy wrappers under the covers. I say this because there is no sense of order or reason in this application.\n\nYou eventually figure things out after a lot of tapping through various screens. But to give you an example, if you don\u2019t link a SmartApp function to a device when you join it for the first time, there is absolutely no documentation or help on how to do it after the fact. It can be done, but not until you go through a half dozen unnecessary screen to find it. So what\u2019s a SmartApp? It is what is needed to do any automation or monitoring for the devices you install. Without them, you simply have a very expensive way to remotely control your lights and monitor the temperature in your house.\n\nDevices: It seems a few companies have really jumped into this technology in a big way. Schlagle, Kwickset, GE, Aeotec, Samsung, Next, Honeywell, are just a few that have incorporated z-wave technology into their devices. None of them are cheap. A regular non-zwave wall switch at Home Depot is about $4.00. A GE z-wave switch will set you back at least $40.00. Motion sensors, sirens, are 50.00 or more. The high end Schlagle locks are going for $300.00. The problem is compatibility and drivers. Just like devices you plug into your PC, every one of these devices needs a driver that the SmartThings hub can understand. SmartThings will list a device as compatible even if there is minimal support for the item. For instance, I purchased an Aeotec Multi sensor 6, the newest sensor out there for motion, temperature humidity, light levels etc. Sure enough, it joined the network in the usual 4 tries. But it didn\u2019t support all of the functions. Nether SmartThings or Aeotech have a driver that supports all the functions, yet both claim compatibility with each other. Also it was grossly inaccurate. But that\u2019s another review. The solution was finding a thread on some obscure forum pointing to a driver written by a very smart person that can be installed though the web GUI. Imagine buying a $50.00 computer mouse that only goes up and down and you had to find a driver written by a third party to make it go in every direction.\n\nSupport: Nonexistent! Both SmartThings and the manufactures of most of the devices have no phone support. You have to email them and they may get back to you in a few days with a canned response that may offer no help, but a promise of a fix in \u201cthe future\u201d.\n\nThe Community: Exceptional! SmartThings has an all volunteer community of very intelligent and helpful people both on SmartThings forum and some others on the internet. Right now this is the sole source of real support for SmartThings and pretty much anything z-wave.\n\nOverall Impression: I love the concept, but all the players have a long way to go. As a hobby I have invested a lot of time and money in SmartThings but it cannot be relied upon for real home security because of 4 things. It relies on an internet connect, electric power, your phone and luck. If you lose any of them, you have also lost all your security. The luck comes in because sometimes SmartThings just isn\u2019t so smart. It doesn\u2019t always do what you want it to do. But I still have hope that Samsung will at some point take this seriously and dedicate a team of real programmers to this technology. I think my investment in the devices is a good one. At only $100.00, the SmartThings hub is not very expensive when you figure in the investment of time and money you put into the devices. If they get their act together, great. If not, I will eventually switch to a different hub that is released by another company that is serious about making this system work. In the meantime, I am amusing myself and frustrating my wife with automating my lights and devices. What\u2019s more fun than that?\n\n2/18/2016 - Update\n\nI still use Smartthings every day for automation and routines and continue to add devices. It seems there are periods of time for hours or days where system performance degrades significantly. Automation of timed actions fail partiality or entirely. You can set 3 lights to come on at sunset. Perhaps 1, 2 or all 3 will fail to come on. If you have an automation that fails for more than a few days, you have to delete it and re add it in the app. I am convinced their servers are overloaded and as more people join the platform and add more devices, their servers get bogged down exponentially.\n\nI think ST has two options. Stop selling any more hubs until they can accommodate the load they already have, or make significant and expeditious growth to their infrastructure. If they don\u2019t do something quick, they are going to continue to get horrific reviews and force users to abandoned ST for the next player to come along who is ready for the challenge. They sorely need a migration tool for upgrades that has been promised for many months. They keep telling people it is coming, but there is no ETA, Their support still stinks! If they can't fix these things, I am ready to jump ship the minute I hear of a viable alternative. Logitech, Microsoft, Apple, anyone, you listening?"}

{"Author": "Alex", "Date": "on January 16, 2016", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Fine to use but a pain to setup", "Text": "I honestly expected a lot more from a major brand like Samsung and was really disappointed by the very awkward interface options for this device. The biggest problem I have with the SmartThings Hub is not being able access it from a computer. The only way to control the SmartThings Hub is to use a smartphone compatible with their app. This phone app is fine but I'm baffled why Samsung would force everyone to configure their Hub this way. I genuinely like the app (now that everything is working) but using a phone touchscreen keyboard to enter in all of the codes and to configure everything for first-time use added a ton of frustration for seemingly no apparent reason.\n\nI was able to connect all of my devices to the hub, but again, it would have been much easier had I not been forced to do this on a phone. The app seems like it's fairly capable, and I eventually got it configured and could group devices into rooms or toggle things like light switches all from one screen, but since there was no instructions and you can only see what will fit on a small phone screen, getting to this point was quite a chore and really took all the fun out of this process.\n\nPerhaps there is hope that some of this can be addressed with software updates - it's a real shame the way the GUI is ruining the experience because the hardware is actually quite good. The hub is pretty much compatible with all major connection technologies, including ZigBee D-Wave, and WiFi, and despite there being some lag on occasion, it's always eventually responded to commands or updated with the correct information."}

Initial impressions are very positive, though the iPhone app could use some design help - not very intuitive. This is developing technology and I look forward to delving more into the SmartThings community and their SmartApps. I will update this review as I bring more switches, outlets and detectors online. At this early stage, though, and having done a lot of research, I believe this is the best automation integration system available - just don't expect it to be perfect."}

We are all paitently awaiting for the new features to come in. Essentially you are getting everything the version one hub has so there is no reason to consider it (likely can't get it anyway).\n\nAre you looking for something that is simple, turn key, easy to understand - then you've likely come to the wrong place. However, the other home automation systems out there are even worse so I would still recommend smartthings.\n\nI've been doing these home installations for 9 months now and every installation is unique. Each customers needs are quick to implement but require extensive knowledge. Yes, the community forums are the best place to get started with advanced features and functions. Be warned, you better be willing to invest 100+ hours ...\n\nThis is true from the previous review:\nHere's an example: SmartThings sells Kwikset locks through their marketplace. They also list it as a supported device. What they don't say is that you won't be able to use ALL of the features the lock is capable of, primarily PIN code management, which is a basic feature on pretty much every other competitor. You can only view the status of the lock and lock/unlock the device. Luckily the community comes to the rescue here and a custom application is available to \"unlock\" these features.\n\nI would also agree the app has gotten more complicated to understand especially if you used it in a previous version."}

What would the common internet user do?\n\nI think you really need to ask yourself, Do you really need this in your home? Even if its Version 2... I think it's too early to really be what you hope it would be. Ask the V1 Hub users how they feel now that V2 has arrived? I have an Amazon Echo and I think it does everything I need it to do and with software updates it continually does more. I have the Philips Hue System, and it works along with the Echo. I also have D-link system that has motion detector, cameras, and everything I need, and it worked from the start... WITH TELEPHONE SUPPORT!\n\nMy advice.. Don't be a 2nd Adopter to this system. Give it more time. You hear all these \"Rants & Raves\" from CES2016 about what's coming. I think, wait till CES 2017 and then consider what new things this device can be useful for. If people are getting so lazy that they can't get up and turn off a light, and then waste time \"fingering\" through an app on their cellphones... well, I guess you are the person that needs this device!\n\nCase Closed!"}

I guess it's just a learning curve figuring out how this thing thinks. I think we have. We like it now!\n\nHowever, I will say this - don't expect any support from Smartthings. If you post a bad review here, in a couple of days they will leave a nice comment saying sorry. But that doesn't really count as support now does it? If Smartthings is to be affiliated with Samsung, they will need to step up their customer service by 100 fold.\n\nUPDATE: I have updated my rating to a three-star rating. I will probably keep learning how this thing works and keep upgrading my rating. First up, the problem we had with our light switch not working -- here's a hint. If you swap out a 3 way switch, (like in our kitchen we have two switches on either side of the room that both turn on the light) you can't use the switch that isn't zwave or you throw the thing out of sync. Got it figured out!\n\nSecond, it seems as though to get the hub to see the Linear garage door opener, we had to sit it next to the hub and push the button that's on the Linear. It worked! Tricky, took a couple of times pushing that button before the hub finally saw it, but it finally did. At this point, I'm really hoping that it's just a matter of learning all the quirks of this system. FINGERS CROSSED!\n_____________________________________________________\n\nIf you look at all my reviews, I rarely, if ever, leave a 1-star review. And granted, I am new to Smartthings. I understand there is a learning curve. It's not like you need to be a rocket scientist to get this hub and the various devices to up and running. It's pretty straight forward as to how you set it up. That's the point. I feel like even a rocket scientist would be pulling their hair out at this point! After reading the rave reviews of how well this works, my hubby and I dove right in. Felt totally confident that it would be a great product....it's a Samsung after all.\n\nHere's what we've seen so far in the first three days: Day one we installed a light switch in the kitchen. It paired right up with the hub. Yay! \"Alexa, turn on the kitchen light.\" And she did! Woo hoo! So we set up a routine \"Good morning\" and tell it to turn the lights on at 6:00 a.m. And we tell it to turn off the lights when everyone is gone. Tried to get the Linear garage door hooked up, never could pair it up. We are sending it back for a new unit to see if that one will work.\n\nDay two: Kitchen light was on. Yay! Went to work, came home, light was still on. What the heck?! \"Alexa, turn off the lights.\" And she did. Tried to use the app (just to see if it would work) to turn it back on again, nothing happened. Lights only came on when I clicked the wall switch.\n\nDay three: Woke up to a dark house. The only things working were the ones on timers that aren't connected to Smartthings. WTH?!\n\nCustomer support is basically non-existent. I emailed them since they don't have a phone number. And their \"chat now\" is NEVER available. Ever. Got one vague email back and nothing since. That is so not like Samsung!\n\nI promise that if we get all this straightened out, things up and running correctly, I will revise and update this rating. But for now, it's staying."}

The device seemed to do its part to login and register itself, but shortly after I started using the app I got an error \"You are not authorized to perform the requested operation.\" OK, minor setup back, let me go scan the forums and see what I can find to remedy the situation.\n\nUpdated a week later:\nI finally got a response from the support team, took about 24 hours. The problem was on their backend and there was nothing I was going to be able to do about it. They resolved it fairly quickly and I was on my way. Once this was cleared up, everything else was fine. I am optimistic now about seeing what I can do with this.\n\nEvery indication pointed to having to get in touch with support. So I tried the Online Chat with support, that appears to still be on their website, but is never actually manned. There is no phone number to call for support, even for first time users just unboxing their device. That leaves one option, sending a request in via e-mail/website form. I did that and got an auto-response that my e-mail was received.\n\nFlash to the next day and no further response. I have had some communication with others that when they finally got in touch with support they were able to get this problem resolved (it appears to be something on the back-end and is not resolvable on the consumer side), however it took upwards of a week to get a response back from Support. I just can't see having this new device sitting here for a week waiting to hear back from support. I spent almost $400 on the hub and all the devices I need for my project, and can't do a single thing. Very frustrating."}

I did my investigations and found SmartThings to be the best bet for that task. I came to Amazon and read these reviews on the device. Obviously, it worried me. There are what seem to be two camps. You either love the hub or hate it. Given the mixed reviews on Amazon I decided not to purchase from Amazon and instead buy locally at BB with the warranty so I could/can just return it easily if something happens. I have to say this device just works. In about 2 minutes I had my door lock added as a device and was locking and unlocking it. After some forum searching I quickly discovered that there's a team of people who have spent a lot of time making custom apps for the hub located here http://smartthings.ramitbhalla.com/ . So I spent another 10$ in donation money and now I can do some ridiculous things with my door lock. I have since in about the span of 2 weeks added a smoke alarm and a thermostat which both easily added themselves to the hub and are both now managed. It honestly might have taken 1-2 hours to get everything added and customized using the open API of smartthings and the apps above. I love this device and am so glad I didn't buy into the FUD that some people are spreading about it on this listing. If your new to HA this device will do just fine for you!"}

The motion sensor itself is tiny, battery operated, and reliable.\n\nDirect Ethernet connection is more reliable and avoids a power hungry WiFi radio. Battery backup and local smarts allow basic functions to work without power or Internet (like any decent home security system). It's an open platform that supports plug-in applications. It includes visual instructions, recommendations, a store, and let's you organize your SmartThings by Devices, Rooms, or Applications.

Unfortunately, execution and support is TERRIBLE. For example, my lights constantly disconnect from the SmartThings hub, requiring me to reauthorize my lights every day or every other day. The app constantly tells me that there is some sort of unexpected error with no indication of what the error might be. Attempts to contact Samsung Support has come to naught. Samsung does not provide you with a telephone number to call. All support must be done through emails (but there is nobody to respond to your support emails) and the live support (which apparently doesn't work either).\n\nAll in all, a terrible device for my purposes.

{"Author": "Skyhawk", "Date": "on January 3, 2016", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Works Flawlessly with iPhone. I Have Many Things Connected. A FEW Software Shortcomings Prevents Total Perfection.", "Text": "Works Flawlessly with iPhone. I Have Many Things Connected. A FEW Software Shortcomings Prevents Total Perfection.\n\nSo glad that I switched to iPhone. The iPhone app is 4.83 stars\n\nWhen shopping for a Z-Wave / Zigbee Hub the popularity of that hub is an important consideration. It does appear that the SmartThings Hub is now number one. I think the much loved Revolv Hub WAS #1 until it was purchased by The Evil Empire (aka, Google), and dismantled.\n\nSmartThings has an active user forum where you can get help and suggestions from other users like you. I have read some criticisms of SmartThings support. I had occasion to write them about an issue and I received a reply in about 24 hours. On another occasion, it took about 3 days to get an answer. I'm disappointed in the timeline, but I did receive good and helpful answers. I suspect, (but do not know) that the support is coming from free Korea.\n\nPrimarily, I am using the SmartThings hub to control Aeon Labs DSC24-ZWUS Smart Switchs, (5-stars also). One merely has to press the button on the switch several times rapidly in order to pair it with the SmartThings hub.\n\nA few observations are:\n\n1) Take the batteries that come with the SmartThings hub and throw them away. Replace them with lithium batteries. Lithium batteries last about four times longer, and I have never seen them leak.\n\n2) When I first installed the app, I found that I had to enter my user name and password repeatedly. This annoying problem was addressed by support and the problem has almost gone away.\n\n3) If controlling things during a power failure is important. Consider plugging this unit into a Sine Wave output, Uninterruptible Power Supply.\n\n4) Regarding the range of Z-Wave / Zigbee devices. Each Z-Wave / Zigbee device acts as a repeater. So start using devices that are closer to the SmartThings hub and move outwards. The nearby devices will repeat the signal to the ones further away. If you have no nearby devices, Z-Wave / Zigbee signal repeaters are available.\n\n5) Thermostats: When shopping for thermostats I strongly prefer ones that have an LED indicator light. My house has 11 thermostats, (large house with zones). With an LED indicator light you can tell at a 20'-50' distance whether the thermostat is calling for heat or air conditioning. Red = Heat, Green = A.C. Very nice when lying in bed, or other situations when you don't want to get up and look at your thermostat.\n\nRegarding the SmartThings program (app).\n\nIT WORKS! Performs very solidly. When at home, it utilizes my Wi-Fi network. Response times are virtually instantaneous when I tap on a switch using the iPhone app. The device operates with about a 1/4 second delay. This is about as good as it can get. From 1000 miles away, using the SmartThings network. The delay is a couple of seconds.\n\nThings that could be better in the SmartThings program (app), (Warning, I spent many years designing, and approving software interfaces.)\n\n1) All of your devices can be found under a category they call, \"Things\". This list is alphabetized. There should be an option to reorder this list.\n\n2) There is a category called, \"SmartApps\". Under this category I can only find an item called, \"Smart Lighting\". Why they use the word \"Lighting\" I do not understand. Most of the things I am controlling are not lights at all. I might call this category simply, \"Programming\". Under \"Smart Lighting\" you will find any programming you have done, for example, turn off switch 3 at 9:30 PM. This list cannot be reordered. It should be.\n\n3) ALL lists should have the ability to be reordered.\n\n4) In order to help organize things they have a heading called, \"Rooms\". Perhaps that's the way most people will use this. In my case under, \"Rooms\" I have things like. First-floor cameras, Second-floor cameras, Christmas lights. As you can see, I'm not using the rooms, as rooms simply a way to categorize different things.\n\n5) I find no way to copy my programming in one SmartThings Hub and transfer it to another one. I would like to have the ability to make a backup of my programming should my hub ever fail.\n\nMany people will use SmartThings to increase the security of their home. Many experts now recommend AGAINST continuous outdoor lighting. It turns out, that in many cases outdoor lighting is simply illuminating the criminals work area. It also turns out that many criminals are afraid of the dark! You are probably better off to have outdoor security lights on motion sensors. That way, when a bad guy is walking nearby, the lights snap on and startles them. Burglars don't like changing environments. Moreover, remember this. Most burglaries happen during the daytime.\n\nSmartThings is still relatively new. I suspect that the few glitches that they have will be ironed out over time. SmartThings appears to be making a solid commitment to home automation, this is probably a product you can grow with.\n\nAnd finally, many of us have learned to avoid any product with the name, \"Smart\" or the name, \"Green\" in the product name or description. SmartThings is an exception to this usually good rule."}

Most of the rules you write will be stored and run on Samsung's servers. They may say that some apps are run locally, most are not.\n2 - Server problems are a common event. Sometimes it is a bad cluster or they are upgrading the servers. Sometimes, it's just because...\n3 - You must visit the community forum if you want to get anywhere. That is where you can find out about all the problems and solutions. It is also where you can see that this is very open source and Samsung is looking for the community to mature the product.\n4 - You must treat this like a hobby. Ever thought about getting a Raspberry Pi? This product is for you. If want nothing more complicated than buying a smart TV and connecting it to the internet, this product is not for you.\n5 - This product is not suitable for anything critical like safety, security, or health. If you have serious needs and want something more turn key. Look elsewhere.\n6 -There is no phone support. Email or forum help only.\n\nOn the other hand:\n7 - You can have fun with this as a hobby if that's what you're looking for. Many of the negatives listed above are positives when treated as a hobby.\n8 - This is about as good a product you can buy at this price point. Face it, home automation has been around for decades. Getting hardware with internet connectivity and a phone app for $99 is pretty good. Just know what you are getting.\n\nIf I didn't hate to give up on things, I would have trashed my hub by now.

After several hours spent researching which hub to purchase (Smartthings, Homeseer, Vera Edge, etc), I decided on this device for my parents home for many reasons:\n1. Multiprotocol support (Zwave, Zigbee, Wifi, and Bluetooth). This thing can control pretty much anything (given the device is supported either by ST or the ST Community).\n2. The Community. Even before buying, I was searching the forums and quickly found out that other ST users are willing to help with any issue. Also there is usually a user developed custom device type or smart app to help integrate any device that is not \"officially\" supported by ST. (for instance, my MyQ garage door openers are now controlled by ST thanks to a community member creating a custom Smart App and Device Type.\n3. Samsung recently bought SmartThings. I love Samsung and I expect great things to come from this acquisition.\n4. The app is user friendly (once configured) so my non-tech savvy parents can utilize the home automation system for monitoring and controlling their house.\n\nThere are some things that are keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating:\n1. Must be connected via ethernet. Basically have to have this next to your router/switch (or buy a longer ethernet cord).\n2. You are pretty much SOL if the internet goes out.\n3.

I love this product and still do. But my experience with Ver 2 of the Hub has been pathetic compared to Ver 1. The routines will stop working regularly, app experience is sub-optimal compared to my experience with Ver 1 and I would have to reboot the hub to get the routines working again. Has happened 3-4 times in the last 3+ months of using Hub Ver 2. The support has been more than awesome and pro-active. They have reached out to me based on my complaints on Twitter. Their CEO responds to questions and complaints on Twitter. So I can claim that I am a satisfied customer as far as their support is concerned. But the annoyance with the routines from not working properly and the need to reboot/reset is a pain. Not sure if I got a bad piece but this is annoying. In my opinion, a good smart hub product should be boring. Once it is set up you shouldn't be worrying about it. However, my experience with Smartthings Ver 2 is sub optimal. In short, bet on Smartthings but stick to Hub Ver 1, if possible."}

The online forums have basically given up, the device is not reliable. Hopefully now that Samsung has bought the company, their engineering expertise will solve these problems.

{"Author": "SincLabs", "Date": "on December 23, 2015", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "UPDATED! - Garbage - This is not ready for prime time...", "Text": "I just had to update this review: This product not only doesn't work reliably, but it is also dangerous. I was very concerned originally with the way Samsung implemented their battery backup solution (rechargeable AA batteries). I still had my SmartThings hub plugged in, although I rarely use it anymore as I have and moved most of my smart home gear away from it. Last night at 2AM I heard this zapping/crackling sound. I just happened to have the SmartThings hub in my master bedroom where I had been testing it. Not the normal spot (closet). I got out of bed and immediately noticed the sound was coming from the SmartThings hub. I picked the hub up and turned it over only to find the rechargeable batteries leaking badly. This is supposed to be a product you setup and forget. This was not good. I removed the batteries and re-installed the battery cover. I left the hub plugged in as I was still testing it. About a half hour later I again heard the zapping/crackling sounds. I went back to the hub and unplugged it as it smelled and apparently had started smoking. I mean seriously folks... unplug this thing and throw it out. OLD REVIEW: Okay so let me just say that I was a big fan of the SmartThings platform. A huge fan prior to Samsung acquiring SmartThings. Sense Samsung has taken over the company I have had numerous issues that all started when I upgraded to the V2 hub from the V1 hub. The upgrade itself was actually more painful than it should have been. Sense this new hub has been online it has gone offline numerous times, mainly when I have been away. So with the hub offline and me away it is basically worthless. The entire reason I got this hub was to keep an eye on things when I am out. So its pointless at this point. I have to reboot it regularly. Now it rarely turns on the lights when it is supposed to. Presence sensing is also awful. Sense the device works off presence detection, again its got issues. I am really bummed about it and I am sad that I spent money on this. I was concerned once Samsung took over and my concerns have been validated. This is not ready for prime time."}
{"Author": "Brian J Lambert", "Date": "on December 23, 2015", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "The best home automation hub for the price, but still a work-in-progress", "Text": "The best hub on the market for its price range, but is still a work in progress. Great for automating simple home controls. This hub is a modest improvement over the 1st generation hub, but it makes it (relatively) simple to connect compatible devices and control them and get alerts.\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN V1 & V2:\nThe design for V2 is slightly more boxy, but they are very similar in appearance. The new design allows it to hold 4 AA batteries for backup when power goes out (great for a security alarm, but most things that it connects to requires power, so this isn't a huge deal). The new hub is slightly faster, but more importantly, allows for [some] offline processing of events. The new hub also allows it to connect to some networked cameras, but I do not have any that are compatible, so I'll have to take their word on it.\n\nSETUP:\nSetup was simple enough with the free app on the App Store (works with iPhone and Android only, though. no iPad app or Windows app). Connect power & a wired network connection (no wifi). I plugged it in, it updated for about 5-10 minutes, and I could immediately start adding devices. When you add a device it brings some options to make them \"smart\", such as lighting controls to turn on lights when motion is detected or a door is opened.\n\nAPP & USE:\nThe SmartThings app is way over-complicated. It's been refined in the last year, but it needs another makeover to help simplify some things. I primarily use the Smart Lighting app to control lights. It works locally with supported devices, so it responds fast and will still turn on lights with motion even if the internet goes down. The SmartThings servers sometimes act up, but this hub helps keeps things running through minor hiccups. It also can push notifications when there is unexpected activity when away from home. The app breaks these different functions up to add clarity, but things get complicated really fast.\n\nDEVICES:\nI highly recommend investing in a few door contact sensors and a few motion sensors. In addition, add some compatible light bulbs or switches.\nBefore purchasing any devices, make sure they are listed on the SmartThings website as certified. You can also browse recommended devices from the app. There are a lot of great devices out there, and most (but not all) Z-wave and Zigbee devices will work, but just make sure. I use several zigbee lightbulbs (Osram, etc.), Z-wave motion and contact sensors, and a few Z-wave outlets in addition to a LIFX multi-color light bulb.\n\nSmartThings just added a 3rd party monitoring service that can call the police if there are intrusions detected by the hub. It's $20/month and could be handy if you use SmartThings as an alarm system. The service isn't necessary, but does help if you travel a lot and can't contact the police yourself. It doesn't cover fire alarms, but maybe they can add that in the future.\n\nPROS: Works with many devices. Performs some basic functions offline. Continual updates to add devices & features. Great online community resources.\n\nCONS: Complicated App. Expect some outages. Still overly-reliant on the cloud. Only works on iPhone (not iPad) and Android.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: I recommend this hub if you want to start automating your home and aren't afraid to tinker with devices and routines. It's pretty amazing when it works! You can have lights come on when you come home, walk into a room, or open a door. You'll get alerts when there's home activity when you're away and keep an eye on things at home."}

After that, you have to figure out everything else on your own. The Menu is not intuitive. I've spent A LOT OF TIME trying to figure out where I need to go to get something done and then when I think I've got it, I'm still wrong. I have a Master's in Computer Science - it shouldn't be this hard to understand. Minimally, they should provide a template that shows you how to maneuver through the menu.\n\nYes, there is Support - sort of. If you go to their support page, they make you believe that there is Chat Support available - I've tried many times to have a \"CHAT\", but not a single time was I able to connect - always get a \"no one available\" message and now they are closed for the holidays. So you have to send them an email - response takes 2-???? days - I've had response in 2 days, but I have had some in for over 7 days and still no response. Not what I call good support.\n\nI've tried using my phone (Samsung Galaxy S4) and my wife's phone (Samsung Galaxy S3) as presence devices. All I can say, is that using your phone as a presence device is totally unreliable. It seems worse with my wife's phone than mine, but still not good. I get notified that I or my wife have arrived home when we're more than three miles away. You don't want to be turning on your lights, opening your garage, and unlocking your doors when your shopping at the grocery store or still at work. We have done everything that has been recommended by Support, but nothing really helps. I've checked our phone's gps and it sees us where we are, so I don't know how it could be reporting us home. Last week, we were 1200 miles away and it reported us as arriving home. I have not tried to use the Samsung Presence device yet to see if that works any better.\n\nOn the positive side, lighting using switches, remotes, and scenes work well. This was the primary purpose for us, so we are not too unhappy with this. We will be getting additional devices for motion and temperature sensing and I will provide updates as we go."}

After two days of removing the switches, resetting the hub, adding the switches back, leaving the breaker switch off all night (as per a recommendation in their support forums), I can no longer add the switches back easily or at all and when they do reconnect they will not respond to any app commands.\n\nMy next step was to use the built in \"Support Chat\" feature in the app. As soon as I tapped on the chat link I got a message saying the chat is not available and I should email support. Why the heck in that in your app if it is not usable? So I went online to the chat feature that imposes itself on you whenever you go to the forums. I open it up and I am able to enter my question.

Unfortunately, I'm away from home for another month and will be unable to do that reset so I am assuming all my \"things\" are stuck in the state they were in at the time of the problem. My outdoor lights are on 24x7, I have no ability to monitor the security and conditions of my building, nor do I have the ability to operate door locks remotely for visitors.

I wanted something that would provide a basic alarm system and do some home automation. I think I got it about half right.\n\nI'm new to home automation, but I've been playing with this for about two months now. I've got four door sensors, a motion detector, a switch, and an alarm.\n\nIf you want an alarm system that you can depend on, this isn't it. Today is a case in point. I forgot to disarm off the alarm when I came home. I didn't get a blaring alarm, I got total silence. It was a few minutes before this clicked. I checked, and the alarm was still \"armed.\"\n\nThe hub has done this several times since I've had it. It just seems to lose touch with sensors, but it isn't aware that it has done so. My entry door was still showing that it was \"closed\" while I held it wide open. I checked and found that another one of my four doors was also just lost. (I can tell that our primary door was connected earlier today, but the other door may have been down for quite some time.)\n\nWhen the hub has lost its way before, I've taken out the batteries and unplugged it, and it has reconnected with the sensors. That didn't work today. No, its not that they are too far from the hub (or it shouldn't be). One of the lost doors is about 10 feet away. So, I can google this and hunt around ... that isn't how I'd like to spend my time.\n\nIn addition to losing contact with sensors, the hub has just plain lost its way. We got a 4:00 am text last week telling us the hub was offline -- our Internet connection wasn't.\n\nIf the light that we have hooked up to our motion sensor doesn't click on, we just walk over and flip the switch. (That does work most of the time and is nice.) If your alarm doesn't come on when someone breaks into your house while you're asleep in your room, that's another story. That, unfortunately, is the SmartThings story.\n\nI'd like to say that I have a better recommendation, but I don't. All I have right now is this system that I really wish I could recommend, but I can't. My advice is to keep looking. Let me know what you find."}

First devices would stop sending statuses (I am trying to monitor power usage), the door sensors would register as never being closed, and then last but not least the dumbthing would go offline even though the internet is up.\n\nThe last straw was with the presence features. You can only add ONE iphone. I went to add my wifes tonight and the app kept saying this phone was already added.

Was told there may be issues with customers with Verizon FIOS with the router/hub. I was able to get into my firewall and open the ports. After not getting it to work the company sent me a new hub to ensure it I didn't get a bad hub. I got a package with a few smartthings 2 sensors, 1 motion sensor and an outlet. I was able to get the hub up and running and even got the outlets and sensors working - the motion sensor was broken in the package (the piece to connect to the battery had fallen off (not a good soldering job). I found out that these are not Z-wave devices, but Zee-bee or something different. So I guess its kind of working but not for what I need it for.

Here is why:\n\nThe hub itself has had issues which require a physical reset. There was not way to access the hub remotely so I had to physically disconnect the power to reset it. This would be impossible if you are trusting this system to work while you are away traveling.\n\nThe motion sensor did not trigger all the time so there was a good chance someone could go by it and it wouldn't trip the security alert. I got rid of that sensor.\n\nThe lights have worked pretty well from what I know. The major problem is that the way the system meshes together, if one of the light switches goes down, other devices stop working too. Even if those devices should be able to see the hub directly without using the other device as a repeater. This wouldn't be as bad if the app actually showed the correct status. It seems that with the app, it sends the command to turn a light on, changes the displayed status to \"on\", but never verifies if the switch actually turned on. The app can't be relied on to tell you the actual status of your devices. I'm still having this problem to this day.\n\nThese issues do seem to pretty common after reading through the forums. For the price it probably isn't bad. It does work decent for doing some basic things if you can accept they may not always work as expected.\n\nI needed to move my hub to a different room, which is actually much closer to my existing devices.

Smartthings found the smoke detector right away and I had no problems pairing with it. The door sensor I purchased also paired seamlessly. I had some problems getting 2 GE link bulbs to work, but after browsing the forums, it turned out to be a WIFI interference from my router. After I shut off the 2.4 GHz signal and turned off remaining WIFI devices in the room, the light bulbs paired immediately. I have now moved the hub away from the router and so far so good. It was pretty simple to program my hub to turn the lights on at sunset, turn them off at a set time when I'm away. It arms itself when I leave, and disarms when I arrive home via my smart phone. I now get a door open signal when the cat sitter arrives when I am on vacation so that I can use my foscam to view them playing with the cats. I plan on hooking up my automated irrigation system with a remote outlet so that I can not only program the watering schedule, but activate it remotely on demand.

Kudos to the SmartThings team for all of the firmware updates and capacity upgrades. They are obviously improving the system dramatically. Things just work now and I don't have to even think about it. I've got my fingers crossed that these improvements will last.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nAfter a few months of successful testing with the v1 hub, I decided to go all-in with Smartthings over the past few months. I've now invested over $1800 in devices and migrated everything to the v2 hub. Everything seemed to begin going downhill once I switched to the 2nd gen. hub.\n\nSmartthings has always had its quirks, but over the past few weeks it has gotten so bad that it has become a complete nuisance. The biggest issue by far is that routines are failing constantly. We woke up this morning to a cold house (the thermostat failed to trigger), a dark house (all the lights failed to trigger), and a blaring alarm when opening the door (the alarm failed to disarm). When we arrived home, I hit the \"I'm Home\" routine and again the alarms sounded upon entering for reasons unknown and the house was dark.\n\nAt this point I'm ready to find our 20 year-old Honeywell programable thermostat, go back to timers with dials on the lights, and fire up the ancient ADT alarm system again. Things were much easier and worked much better the good old-fashioned way. I've actually managed to dumb-down our house with Smartthings.\n\nSmartthings would be great if things worked as they're supposed to work, but I'm finding myself spending hours in the forums each day and reprogramming routines trying to troubleshoot all the issues. It's cause for great celebration if a day without problems. It's just not worth it anymore. Time to pull the plug on Smartthings and hope some other miracle hub comes along to take advantage of all the Zigbee and Z-wave devices we've accumulated."}

Getting my Android phone to configure the SmartThings hub was also very easy. I then added the switches and the only glitch was I forgot to tap the first switch paddle to let the hub find it. Once I did that it was up and running. You do have to remember to export devices to Amazon Echo. I guess that's a security feature to let you restrict Echo's access to some devices. Now adding a Z-Wave switch to control the front door lights and a Z-Wave light bulb to allow remote control over at least one light in the living room.\n\nAs I wasn't coming from the 1st generation hub I did not experience the deregistration problems that others have."}

It was ridiculously easy to set up, especially compared to the Nexia bridge. Download the app (I have an iPhone), follow the instructions, done. I liked it so much that I ordered another samsung device -- the door sensor. It attaches to the door and if someone opens it while you are away. Again, super easy to set up and configure.

The support is great and any issue I have had, mostly with small set up issues, are addressed quickly by a great staff at Smart Things. They warn you that it may take a bit to get to your question, but within minutes or a couple hours I will get a response and my question is answered. They have always even followed up to make sure I am still not having issues. Love That!!!!\n\nThe Smart Things Hub works great with the Amazon Echo too. Many products that I couldn't control with the Echo before, I can control with ease now. Either through voice prompts with Echo or through the Smart Things app, your products snap to attention by turning off, on, up,down, locked, or unlocked etc. all very quickly.

If you don't believe me, PC Magazine gave this product an Editor's Choice. I truly can not relate to some of the negative user reviews here because my experience has HONESTLY been nothing but positive. The few snags I have had were quickly resolved.

To be fair, it does work most of the time, but it has also let me down a few times. Now, because of that, I don't fully trust the system and I'm constantly checking up on it. That's not really an ideal situation. The biggest issue with this product, is that it's 100% cloud based, so if the could goes down, you lose a lot of the hub's functionality. Now, most manual routines and actions will work if the cloud goes down, but any automatic ones won't work. I've had my thermostat stay at the daytime temp all night, lights not come on in the morning, outside lights stay on all night. Again, these aren't every day or even every week occurrences, but they have lowered my confidence in the system, especially now that's it's heating season and that I have all of my Christmas lights controlled by SmartThings.\n\nWhen the system is working (which again is most of the time) it is fantastic. Being able to set up routines that turn on lights, lock doors, and raise the thermostat all with one trigger is nice. One of the best routines I have, is that when I come home after sunset and unlock my door, the lights in my house come on and my thermostat raises to the desires temp. That's pretty convenient.\n\nSo again, if you are a patient person who loves to tinker, this product is right for you. If you want a system that is hands off and worry-free... well, I don't think SmartThings is quite there yet."}

My porch light comes on automatically every night and shuts off in the morning, and i can control my thermostat from anywhere.

There's also the fact that you are able to further integrate your devices with IFTTT, though i have to say that i have not yet played around with it.

As with every home automation hub out on the market now the biggest issue is device compatibility. If you are just starting I definitely recommend this hub since it supports a very large list of devices.

Case in point, my SC hub supports Lutron Pico remotes and this one doesn't. I currently have my SC hub connected only those devices I an using my pico remotes for, once I have time to figure out if combining my ST hub and my SC hub will work for me I think I will be all set. Otherwise I will have to decide on if I want to keep things as they are or replace my pico remotes with z-wave remotes and totally remove my SC hub from my setup."}

{"Author": "Mmm", "Date": "on November 7, 2015", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Averages out to four stars...", "Text": "Three stars if you have very little technical prowess. The system is very easy to get hooked up on your network and identify Smart bulbs, etc. at a very basic level. I've accumulated several Wemo items, and the Hue system through the years. As I've upgraded my network, and dealing with increasingly complex passwords, I stopped using the Wemo integration devices and just used the bulbs as normal bulbs. Same thing with the Hue system. When I got the Smartthings hub for my birthday, I decided to get things going again. Smartthings immediately found all of the Wemo devices, even though the interface systems of the Wemo were no longer part of the network. Nice! The Hue did require me to configure the bridge and then add it into the Smartthings system.\n\nBut this is where the love affair ended. While it is easy to turn the bulbs on/off and adjust the brightness, doing the simple tasks like building schedules isn't the most intuitive process. I can't just go somewhere and build a schedule. You have to build that schedule, and then apply it to a mode for the hub. You then have to mark your mode within the hub when you've left for vacation, or whatever.\n\nFive stars if you're technical and willing to accept the learning curve. The hub is super powerful if you're willing to learn and dig into the system. Github brings in all kinds of \"Apps\" which are lacking out of the box. As I mentioned above, the Vacation Lights solved this problem. You still need to make yourself away, however this can be accomplished by utilizing the geofence, and linking that to your phone. Once outside of a radius, change mode to <whatever>. I'd like to see something of once xx miles outside of the geofence, set mode to vacation, or something like that. It's probably out there, but I'm very early in the learning curve.\n\nIn summary, I would say, if you're willing to get both hands dirty and spend a fair amount of time, this is a great system. If not, look to the functions within the more consumer driven products. At that level, the Wemo and Hue offer great interfaces, but must be programmed individually, unless you buy into one system."}

I was excited about some of the advertised features with this v2 hub. But after having it for a day, I'm not excited anymore. if you already own v1 and plan on upgrading to this one, then get ready to sink a ton of time into moving all of your devices over. SmartThings has no easy way to move existing configuration to the new hub. I had to exclude and re-add all 45 of my devices. Im actually still working on getting a handful of devices over that don't want to corporate. The worst part is that some features that were supported on the v1 hub do not work on the new v2 hub. Namely, my garage door controller. I used to have the ability to see when my garage was open or closed with a sensor and have it work in conjunction with a z-wave switch that allowed me to open or close the door, always seeing the current state of the door. Not possible (at this point) with the v2 hub. Really not happy about this. So no I'm at a point where I am seriously considering putting my old v1 hub back in service and spending another 12 hours moving my devices back to it and returning the v2. When I think about it, the only thing I gain with the v2 hub is battery backup, local processing for network failures, and video support that will cost $5 a month after 2015. In addition, I haven't really seen a big difference in latency from the local processing on the v2.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you are new to home automation, IFTTT, and like tinkering then SmartThings is great. If you already own a v1 SmartThings hub and are thinking about upgrading, then I would hold off."}

{"Author": "Dan D", "Date": "on November 5, 2015", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Version 1 Better, Too Many Bugs", "Text": "I researched before buying my first home automation hub. Through all the cost-benefit analysis, I went with the first-generation, publically available product. I quickly got the v1 hub to work, and was able to integrate my Hue kit along with many third-party sensors. I wired my garage with a Z-Wave controller in a test of DIY affordability. There was an occasional issue and the v1 application on iOS took some time to understand the GUI. Overall, the SmartThings Support team was always available and the quality was perfect.\nI recommended the product to colleagues who were using Wink. They often complained of processing lag time, of which I had none with SmartThings. I was excited about the next generation. I was also able to integrate more products of different kinds with the help of the developer forum (still fantastic!).\nThen v2 came out.\nWhile my application\u2019s dashboard was still functional, I was able to work around some gaps to add users (I can still do that because my dashboard is intact from V1). I can also still use my garage door functionality. My colleague who started with V2 cannot do either of those things.\nV2 was a clear step backward. The concept of MVP (e.g. Agile development) should be incremental improvements and steps forward. V2 hardly meets \u201cminimally viable\u201d and it should hardly be considered a sellable \u201cproduct.\u201d There are no discernable, practical improvements from V1.\nThen the bugs started and continued.\nSince migrating to V2, I\u2019ve had consistent downtime when I previously had none. I\u2019ve had all my ZigBee-based devices lose their connection to the hub (taking out the battery and reinserting after two minutes solved). I\u2019ve had multiple GE Link Bulbs lose their connections multiple times, and it has gotten worse since the end of October. Nothing has changed on my end.\nI\u2019ve argued with tech-support about some logic gaps (e.g. the initial removal of \u2018light power allowance\u2019 that ultimately was added back). I\u2019ve also had to argue about \u201clight turn on\u201d not sending the \u201csetlevel\u201d command. That was ultimately corrected with a program update, but not until after multiple weeks of correspondence and repeated instances of \u201cIT\u2019S NOT WORKING!\u201d\nI\u2019ve now had delays in processing that were never there. I\u2014luckily\u2014have more app functionality because my dashboard remains useful and intact. Had I lost my dashboard or the ability to add family members to the account, I would\u2019ve returned v2 over a month ago.\nHere is what SmartThings needs to do:\n\u2022 Take ownership. Recognize that selling the product as it is described, at best, constitutes deception. Offer discounts to current users who have placed their faith in all that was advertised.\n\u2022 Communicate. Many of us who are in the developer community or on this board are prepared to tinker. We understand \u201cstuff happens\u201d and coding takes time; however, at this point we need constant updates.\n\u2022 Invest in support. I used to get a quick email reply from SmartThings Support, now there are multiple day-long delays. Given all the issues, SmartThings needs to prioritize this for its legions of unsatisfied customers.\n\u2022 Reconsider the Dashboard. Bring that back. The functionality that was there in v1, while not perfect is more of a minimally viable product than the current iteration.\n\u2022 Delay future product releases until more testing can be done. There\u2019s a difference between MVP and a pile of garbage.\nI hope to stay with SmartThings; however, it is becoming less likely given the issues, lack of communication, and overall slow resolution.\n\nBased on the above I'm at 2 stars."}

Don't buy this if you aren't willing to tinker and if you are going to depend fully on it's features. Multiple user support broke at launch 2 months ago, and still hasn't been fixed, while other useless features, like some weird weatherbug integration took priority. At one point, a change on their end resulted in all of my time-based automations no longer working. I needed to go into each one and re-save them to make that work. This happened system wide for all users, yet I only found a resolution from a their community forums and a third party website. Support is a joke. Chat support is often disabled if their request volume is too high, there's no phone number to call, and they may or may not reply to your emails. SmartThings staff on the community problems don't say much other then tell you \"soon\" or \"stay on topic\" or \"we're working on it\" when issues like multiple user support come up. This company is suffering some serious growing pains.\n\nOn the other hand, it's the only hub I know of that combines ZigBee and Z-Wave, with a handy app, amazon echo support, local execution of many commands with a 'cloud' based back-end, built-in battery backup along with maintaining some basic functionality when the internet is down - all in a $99 package. It has so much going for it, but the support or lack thereof and the broken/breaking features are likely a dealbreaker for some."}

I'm going to move to a different product, preferably one that is entirely local and not reliant on a web based server for its automation.

I would have given a full 5 star rating if it wasn't for the seemingly invisible technical support on the Smart Things website. Although there are a lot of subjects covered onine there appears to be no recourse for issues that are not. For example I added my Samsung S6 edge as a presence device and it continually yields a refrush error and even if you remove the device or re-add it the refresh error nag screen persists with no method of stopping it short of uninstalling the software entirely and reconfiguring your devices from scratch.

The biggest thing I can say about the product is I feel it is still in a beta stage at this time, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing but should be taken as an indicator to others that the software side of this product is in a constant state of changing/morphing. Hopefully changing for the better and not going towards a \"dead end\" growth. (Along the lines of, how much \"health improvement\" has there been in the fast food industry?). I have not tested the hub to its limits yet but what I can say is that any SmartApps that were working may not work with a SmartThings after an update.\n\nOn the brighter side of things, Cree Connected lightbulbs work amazingly well with the V2 hub. I also use the Aeotec Smart Strip with it. I leave the house, it turns off EVERYTHING. When I come home, it turns on the lights to allows me to walk into a cheerful lit room and my computer has started up. In the process, I learned that I can turn on my computer with a power switch (Aeotec Smart Strip) using boot bios after \"power failure\". It's saved me time and ergonomics from having to reach down to knee/shin length to turn on my computer, redundant walking to turn on lights and allows me to wake up to a room that gradually brightens allowing my eyes to adjust comfortably.\n\nThe next step would be to find motion/occupancy sensors for my closets to trigger lights when entering. Another goal I have in mind is getting the Amazon Echo and integrating it with this. I definitely feel I am starting to develop a relationship with my house, speaking as a single, nerdy male. She comforts me when I'm home, turns on the lights for me and makes sure the lights are off when I leave and texts me that the lights are off.\n\nIn short, great product. FYI to others, it is a double-edged sword like most things in life, so take it with a grain of salt and a cracked pepper. It's definitely a useful tool for convenience, comfort and health. Though, I cannot speak for security or safety and its reliability. I would recommend this product to others and thinking about purchasing another one as a gift."}

But since the company was bought by Samsung, it is not surprising that they integrated the Samsung camera instead. What is surprising it is they basically threw their old customers under the bus with this new V2 hub. There is no plan to work on or improve the V1 hub whatsoever. The Samsung camera is not compatible with V1, and I suspect anything they welcome into the family won't be either. They want you fork over another $100 to buy a new hub. And believe what everyone has said. This is not an easy turn-key system. It is designed for developers who want to write their own codes and integrate different things into the system. No way am I upgrading to V2 and spending any more money on this."}

I cannot get support and there are no forum admin's to assist either. I am back to considering this a steaming pile again for both the ongoing KickStart attitude of this garbage company and the apparent lack of investment in support by Samsung. If I could return this unit today, I would. But, it is obviously too long.. I strongly recommend staying completely away from home automation or considering these units anywhere near ready for primetime security monitoring.\n\n1/8/16 - After having the Smart Home Monitor scripts deleted by support, I took the advice from a helpful person in the ST communities and went with a 3rd party security script ONLY. I have had zero issues since. In fact, my siren actually works with the script flawlessly now. I am receiving both app and sms updates for the family as intended. The system is...working?

{"Author": "Grenik", "Date": "on October 19, 2015", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Good idea, but execution still needs work, particularly the app", "Text": "EDIT: I received a lot of technical support from SmartThings and the system is working better now than it was in the past. The app is more stable and I received help getting more of my devices to operate locally instead of back to ST's servers. The technical support was particularly good from my perspective. Never once did I get an email that said something like \"sorry you have a problem, here is a link to a stock solution or FAQ\". It was individualized to my issues. It was definitely 5-star service and support.\n\nIn light of the excellent service, I wish I could rate the system higher. The app, while more stable now, is still poor and interferes with the experience instead of enhancing it. There is no landscape mode for tablets. There is no summary screen where I can set up the devices that I use the most for quick access. On the surface, the app seems logical and well laid out, but that is only if you do not actually have to use it much. If everything is automated and you use the app once to set up your automation, then it is fine. Everything in a room and all that. But if you want to turn on a couple lights in different rooms and dim them (like I wanted to do for Halloween), then it is drill into each room, each light, set the dim level, back out screen-by-screen, then into another room, into each light, etc.\n\nCompared to the easy and intuitive apps like Phillips Hue, the SmartThings experience is very lacking. I did increase the overall rating because of the excellent support and the improved app stability and would be more willing to recommend it to others. Hopefully development will continue and I am looking forward to a 5-star product!\n\nEND EDIT\n\nI was able to migrate from the original SmartThings hub to the new SmartThings hub, so I guess that is some level of success. The process was very painful and in hindsight, I wish that I would have just stayed on the original hub. In fact, in hindsight, I would not install the system at all. However, with the number of devices I now have, I am not willing to toss the whole system in the trash, but I am getting close.\n\nI had hoped that Samsung ownership would bring some stability along with thoughtful designs from the user standpoint. I have their 12.2 Note tablet and a Galaxy S5 phone. I enjoy their products. However, I do not see any of their \u201ctouch\u201d in this system.\n\nI had read the migration instructions prior to purchasing the new hub and knew that the process involved deleting and removing my old setup and starting over with the new hub. I knew that going into this and planned a full day for migration. I have approximately 50 items connected to my system. Having to go through this process was disappointing, but I knew that up front, so I am not taking off any rating due to having to go through this process.\n\nI experienced two issues which I considered significant and are the reasons for the low rating. First, the app crashes all the time. I could only delete three devices from my system without the app crashing. I tried the app on my Samsung tablet and on my Samsung phone. Both behaved the same way. The previous app seemed to work OK, but this one is terrible. It does not seem to crash as mush in normal use, but every three devices the app would freeze, go black, or pop up a message that there was an error. It also crashed several times as I was adding devices to the new hub. My Galaxy S5 phone is new and almost completely stock. I set it up two days prior to working on the SmartThings system. I had to wait 30-45 seconds after killing the app to re-launch it and do three more items. After doing that a couple times, I had to reboot the device. This added a significant amount of time to the transition process. I wonder how they could release an app that works performs that poorly on Samsung devices?\n\nSecondly, there appears to be no thought put into the migration process to make it easier for the user. I wonder if anyone actually migrated a house full of items before releasing the new app and hub. A couple examples:\n\nEach and every device has to be removed from the old hub. However, to remove the item, it cannot have any Smart Apps associated with it. It would have made the process much easier if I could have put the app in \u201cmigrate mode\u201d and it would have removed the Smart App and the device at the same time. Both needed to be removed, why the multiple steps? Even better would be the ability to remove all the smart apps associated with devices at one time. Some devices need special steps to remove, so I understand not being able to bulk remove the devices. But the Smart App is just the code that is in the SmartThings system. All that could have been deleted at one time.\n\nEvery device has to be added to the new hub once the old hub is removed. When you discover new devices there are likely to be multiple devices that need to be set up. From the \u201cMarketplace\u201d tab, you see the items that need to be set up. You select one, set it up, make a Smart App if needed, and hit done. The program returns you to the Dashboard. Why not back to the Marketplace and the list of items that need to be set up? How about an option to go to the next item to be set up? Again, it would be easy to put a toggle into the app to indicate if you are migrating if the developers did not want to have this be the normal way the app performs.\n\nAll of this may seem minor, but after going through the process, I felt that the developers did not about users that already had a system. It was like they went out of their way to make it more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nThe crashing app and the lack of thought and care for people migrating left me very frustrated. The system has been running now for a full day and I have not noticed any performance improvements. Lights do not turn on faster when tripping the motion sensor for example."}

As a result I'll probably update this review in a few months.\n\nAnd we are new to SmartThings so people who have owned the v1 Hub will probably not find any of this important, whereas newbies to SmartThings may (hopefully will) find this more valuable than the reviews of people who have migrated from v1 to v2 Hubs. I also should point out that I've used Wemos for a couple of years so automating lights and such is not completely a new experience for me.\n\nSetup of the Hub\nThe Quick Start guide is well done and easy to follow. There's a bit that talks about how setting this thing up is...\"Easy peasy\" and I have to agree. I suggest getting the app onto your iPhone, Android, or Windows phone (do people actually have those? sorry, just a joke). Then plug in the hub and follow the instructions on your phone. It took quite a bit of time to go thru the setup (maybe I was just being anxious). I thought it was having issues so I went to the SmartThings website, looked in Support and found out what the different lights blinking in the front meant. Perhaps they should have added those to the Quick Start Guide, but it wasn't a big deal for me to look it up. I think it downloaded an update and after that..boom! I was done and everything was working.\n\nThe setup continues by you selecting your location which it needs for \"geofencing\" which enables your phone to let your home know that you are...well at home. You can also take a picture of your home and also give it a name. Basically it's a super simple setup.\n\nAdding Things\nYep, it's the new buzzword...Internet of Things. So the next step was adding \"things\". I did this ultra slowly by first installing a light switch GE12722 Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control On/Off Switch (I'm a decent handyman so this was easy for me but you may want an electrician if this is out of your comfort zone). Once installed and flipping the breakers back on I tested the light switch using the manual on/off and then attempted to add it using the SmartThings app on my phone. It was both simple and seamless as it connected and I was able to turn it on and off remotely.\n\nMore adds\nI continued to add more devices around the house and worked thru setting up the home. The app uses rooms (even has you take pictures if you like) and then add devices to those rooms. Overall the process was very easy to follow and my variety of light switches, outlets, door/window sensors and even a motion sensor all connected. The motion sensor was the only one where I had to do two attempts but on the second it too connected fine. And I did not use any of the SmartThings branded devices, instead using GE and Ecolink brands.\n\nUsing SmartApps\nSmartApps are how you automate the devices you have added to the hub. Personally I think it's a very odd choice of words, they say you use apps to control the devices but to me that's more like \"rules\" or \"instructions\". SmartApps just doesn't sound right, SmartRules does, but I don't know, maybe it's because I've used Wemos in the past. I should say at this point that the SmartThings stuff is WAY!!! better than using Wemo. I had 4 Wemo switches in use over the past couple of years and only 1 of them still works. And that one got tossed right into trash as soon as I connected up a few of my devices and started to really use SmartThings.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nSo SmartApps you in essence download and then set up to use with your devices. I've only downloaded one so far (don't worry I said I'd update this review as I got into things more). The one I've got is Smart Lighting which is made by SmartThings. Oh, did I forget to mention that one of the main reasons I went with SmartThings is it's incredibly active and strong community? Yes, SmartApps can be (and most are) made by users of SmartThings Hubs. I trolled around their community site for months (community.smartthings.com) and found oodles of good info and suggest you do as well. But back to the Apps, the lighting one from the company is okay, a few things seem odd to me, but again I'm coming from setting up rules on the Wemo.\n\nBut overall it was pretty easy to setup my son's lights to go on at sunset and turn off at his bedtime. I did different rules for our master bedroom lights and did one for turning off our kitchen lights when the motion sensor no longer showed motion in that room. Still playing with it and adjusting things. Deleting rules is easy and redoing them a different way is painless. I also set up a door/window sensor connected to our garage door to let us know if we forgot to close it. My next thing is to download a SmartApp that will send us a text letting us know it's open. Again, a strong user community with plenty of cool SmartApps makes this Hub extremely useful.\n\nAnd although I do give the Hub 5 stars, it's not perfect and some of the UI is not very good. As mentioned some of the jargon is not very intuitive. The App itself also didn't work once to add a new automation (again I've been playing with those a lot and have added, deleted, re-added, re-deleted, etc.) so I wasn't too upset it gave me the hated spinning wheel. But I merely shut the app off on my phone and re-lauched it and everything was fine.\n\nAnd the Smart Lighting app which is from SmartThings does have some very odd UI quirks as well as some things you think should be in there (rules and such) that you can't do. But again, the community is there with replacement Apps or even code snippets that allow you to create your own SmartApps to do whatever you want. And this was a major reason I went with their ecosystem rather than Wink or waiting for Apple to get HomeKit correct and I'm a Mac guy and even worked at Apple way back in the 1990's (wow I sound old). I also like how much more open SmartThings is and the breadth of devices that they support.\n\nAfter a few months I'll update this and I'm sure will have a few more things to pick at, but hopefully also more admiration to the ease of use and the usefulness of the platform."}

Unfortunately, multiple users are not allowed which, as a business, we find less than desirable.\n\nAlso unfortunate is the lack of power over your own device. It seems you cannot do anything without a support technician's help. I could not put another person on to the smart hub and could not even change the email address linked to it myself, because a technician has to do it for you, so I eventually turned to Samsung SmartThings customer service.\n\nNo phone customer service is available at ALL, which is ridiculous for those of us who want something fixed in a timely manner and wish to not have it drag out over a period of days. Instead they have live chat, which would be as good were it ever actually working. This left me with only an email option.\nThe support for email takes days to get through, as Samsung seems to only reply when you are asleep, and is never online during normal waking hours, and is also probably VERY overworked, considering it is everyone's only option.\n\nAll in all, this product would be great were it not impossible to do anything without a customer service person, or if the customer service was at least reachable in a timely fashion."}

Unfortunately, this is not a turn key solution. You won't be able to make use of that potential in the state that this device has been released, you need to be willing to go into the Community forums and find what you are looking for.\n\nHere's an example: SmartThings sells Kwikset locks through their marketplace. They also list it as a supported device. What they don't say is that you won't be able to use ALL of the features the lock is capable of, primarily PIN code management, which is a basic feature on pretty much every other competitor. You can only view the status of the lock and lock/unlock the device. Luckily the community comes to the rescue here and a custom application is available to \"unlock\" these features.\n\nNext there's the issue of device support. I was actually surprised that not all US based Z-Wave devices were supported. I thought that was a requirement to get certified, but it looks like I was wrong. One of my temperature sensors was not supported out of box, but again, thanks to the Community, I was able to find the custom device code to get things working.\n\nFinally, there's the app. It's pretty obvious this was released under the gun. The user experience is confusing at best. I'm sure it will get better, but there hasn't been a lot of movement in the past month since release. It comes off as more of a gen 1 product, not a gen 2. There are even features that were available in gen 1 that are not yet available, such as multiple user support. Want to give someone else access to control your devices? You've also got to either sign them in manually or give them your account password...\n\nA lot of this can easily be fixed through updates. Hopefully, Samsung is working to stabilize the platform and build out its gaps. If you have a working setup today, I would hold off on migrating. If you're looking for a home automation solution and are willing to roll up your sleeves and search for solutions to things that should be native, then this is one of the most powerful platforms on the market."}

I've read that the old app was better but I never used it. There seem to be quite a few complaints about the new app. The app opens to a \"dashboard\" with only \"smart home monitor\" (aka a security system) which is useless if you aren't using the hub for that purpose. Why can't you put the rooms or something else right on the dashboard? Once you set up a device, it's a bit of a pain to change the way you set something up. It's just not very user friendly. Luckily, I'm pretty tech savvy so I've (almost) been able to wrap my brain around how the app works. I saw almost because I still run into puzzling aspects of the app.\n\nMy brief experience with customer service was positive. I have no complaints there.\n\nI'm giving it 4 stars (aka \"I like it\") because it is doing what it is advertising it will do. It would get 5 stars if the app that makes it work was more intuitive. They may need to sit down and rewrite the app from the ground up (again). I can see less tech savvy people getting very frustrated."}

{"Author": "Brandon M", "Date": "on October 7, 2015", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Needs some work so much possibilities!", "Text": "Good day my peoples! As many of you know, I am somewhat obsessed with technology and gadgetry ( and have been since I was a lil kid). I am pretty sure that I drive my wife crazy with all the gadgets and gizmos I have but she loves me still #Blessed . I remember watching the Jetsons as a kid or Lost in Space and thinking , \"How cool would it be to actually have the ability to control things in my home remotely and automatically ?\" Well, this has actually been a \"reality\" for many years but up until recently, has not been connected in ways that we all have wanted. Such as the ability to remotely lock you door (from your phone or internet ) , turn on/off your lights if you forgot to , close your garage for you automatically when you leave the neighborhood and endless other things. But NOW we have come into this age of \"the internet of THINGS\" which is essentially many different \"things\" that all communicate together to allow for the above mentioned actions to take place. I did a brief review previously on the Wink Connected Hub so forgive me if some of this is similar. I liked the Wink but it was almost too simple for what I wanted the potential for . So I bit the bullet and jumped on the SmartThings bandwagon for a nice price of $99.\n\nI already had bulbs, siren, motion sensors and door sensors from my wink and was told that they \"should\" all work with the SmartThings hub. I received my hub next day (Via Amazon ) and ripped the box open to check it all out. I knew that since I had an existing Smart Home network (via Wink) that I would need to disassociate all my devices from that hub before they would connect so I went about my way to Exclude all items from my Wink hub (this is somewhat time consuming since , at least for me , I had to actually \"exclude\" each device 1 by 1 from the wink hub) Once I did this , I shut off my Wink hub and then put in my batteries in the SmartThings hub v2 , hooked it up to power and plugged it in to power and Ethernet (there is NO WIFI ) . I downloaded the iOS app and went through the setup process , well attempted to . My first try was a no go, the app just kept sitting there on the Waiting screen while it looked for the hub . I power cycled it and it came right up after that (I was worried because I had read that several people had the same issue and it had ended up being bad units that were sent out) . I did open a ticket with Samsung in the meantime but figured it out in minutes. (Another note is that they have no phone support and the Tech Support is anything but speedy...took a day to get any response and another few days after that for another response so be prepared to read a lot of forums if you are lost on anything) . I was able to enroll all my devices, Schlage Connect Door lock, my GE z-wave Dimmers, All my GE Link Bulbs, My TCPConnected Bulbs, door sensors and motion sensors (Re-branded 2gig z-wave units), and rebranded 2gig Siren (although it showed up as a switch only) fairly simply. Everything seemed to pair quickly and showed up on the app. At this point, I had all my items on the app and was ready to start the Automation part. This is where things get \"sticky\". The possibilities are endless or seemingly with the Samsung Smart things, but the execution is a bit overwhelming and can be confusing. An example would be setting something up to turn on lights automatically when walking into the room. The initial setup of this is pretty simple via something called \"smart app\" (their way of calling an automation rule ) There are ones that are created by Samsung SmartThings team and ones that the \"community\" creates. The thing with these are that every persons situation and setup is different so it is not always a cut and dry setup. Sometimes you will have to create an SmartApp for 1 set of lights to turn on , then create another one to turn off but again its really difficult even here to try and explain it. My biggest issue I kept running into was that my lights would turn off while I was still in the room (even though I had it set to turn off automatically 15 min after motion stopped) What I didn't realize was that the way it is currently setup is that ,this particular \"App\" starts that 15 min timer after motion stops but doesn't start over if it senses motion in between so imagine you sit down on the couch for a few min and lay there for only 2-3 min, at that point the app thinks no one is there ,so it starts the 15 min countdown to turn the lights off so even if you get up and move, it doesn't register that and then ends up turning the lights off. I realized this after a while of tinkering and reading online that this is an issue with the current software and they are working to resolve it. The cool thing though is that these devices actually have the ability to have programs written for them and \"coded\" so if you are good at Coding , these are quite the amazing little tool. They have an open API that lets the user configure all types of settings . The thing is , they don't really directly tell you about this and you have to do a lot of reading and understanding before you can jump into it (I am a techy person and even for me it confused me ) I eventually was able to run a custom \" Smart App\" and get the lights working for me but even then with the only 2 sensors I have for motion, I am limited as to what I can do. This has a ton of potential but is not generally \"consumer friendly\" in that I can't imagine most people picking one up and making \"just work\" which is why things like Wink, ADT Pulse and IRIS exist and do quite well. For the price , this has some really cool features and the future is looking bright, See below for a brief list of Pros and Cons and some pictures of the HUB itself.\n\nPros:\n\n-Fairly reasonably priced at $99\n-Seemingly Endless possibilities of things to control\n-Works with ALOT of different \"Smart Things\" such as z-wave , zigabee and potentially others down the road.\n-The fact that it works with different \"things\" means you don't have to purchase the \"Samsung\" branded \"things\"\n-Version 2 has Battery backup so it will still communicate with your battery powered items in case of power outage\n-Has the ability to work \"offline\" meaning that if you lose internet , it will still function locally (most others like Wink , will not work at all if no internet)\n-Has ethernet connection\n-Has a large community online of willing users and tons of apps and info\n\nCons:\n\n-App is too confusing to navigate ( I really preferred the Wink one to this as of now) Also no support for multiple users which defeats many of the built in options\n-No wifi which means you have to have it plugged in to Ethernet to communicate so if you want to connect new devices , the unit itself needs to be close to that item while doing the initial \"inclusion\" (there are ways around it such as long Ethernet cable or putting it in inclusion mode then disconnecting Ethernet but it is still a pain)\n-To have your house running properly , you will need to spend a considerable amount of money on devices to make it work as you like ...primarily sensors which are average of 40-50$ each and you will need one in every room or hallway and/or every windows. Then you still need to get things like door lock (200+), Thermostat (120+), garage opener (100+) and so on and so forth.\n-Support sucks and is pretty much non existent but they do try the best they can.\n-The whole process can become overwhelming and confusing (even for a seasoned tech person)"}

Comparison to Wink.", "Text": "I used Wink for a few months and grew frustrated with it's lagginess, unreliable execution of commands, and poor range. News of its bankruptcy gave me little hope for the future so I looked for other options. Enter SmartThings which I have used for about 2 weeks. Here is a brief comparison:\n\nHARDWARE\n-SmartThings is much more compact and easy to hide. The Wink hub is really big and stands vertically.\n\nCONNECTIVITY\n-SmartThings requires a hard ethernet connection while Wink is all wifi. For most people, this means Wink is much easier to place anywhere in the house.\n-SmartThings will need to be hardwired in order to pair with devices. Unless you have jacks all over the house, you will need a really long ethernet cable so your hub can travel to each device. Wink just needs an outlet.\n\nAPP\n-SmartThings app is pretty bad. It is not intuitive and can be tough to navigate. It can take multiple taps to execute a simple command. Categorization is not good either. For example, I found out that I can use the \"Rooms\" tab to compartmentalize my locks, outlets, and switches because it doesn't automatically do that for you.\n-Wink app is much easier to navigate and far more intuitive. Fewer taps are required.\n-Wink widgets are more customizable and sleek than the SmartThings.\n\nRELIABILITY\n-Here is where Wink was becoming a problem and it was mainly with the Schlage Century locks. Too often, it would not lock/unlock the door. The widget shortcut would not work reliably.\n-So far, SmartThings commands have been working at about 95% reliability. While not perfect, it is more reliable and executes lock commands faster than the Wink.\n\nRANGE\n-About the same but my SmartThings is able to reach a distant lock than my Wink couldn't.\n\nOVERALL\nI've been slightly happier so far with the SmartThings hub because it is able to perform it's functions more reliably and with less lag. That's the whole point after all. Once you go through the learning curve of using the SmartThings app, it's acceptable. The Wink is far better in terms of ease of use and intuitiveness but I'm concerned about its long-term support given the recent bankruptcy.\n\nUPDATE Jan 2016: I am still content with this SmartThings hub. I have experienced no major problems. It is not 100% reliable as far as executing the scheduled \"routines\" but it's been good enough."}

In my case the hub kept going offline and then attempting to update and then fail, and then coming back online, repeat forever. My hub was plugged into a switch. Rlley suggested plugging directly into the modem which didn't work but then I tried directly into the router and that did work. The hub was able to update itself and then worked properly and is not stable. So it appears this hub really does need to be plugged directly into the router. I can't understand why it doesn't like being plugged into a switch but it doesn't. Having to locate the hub physically close to the router is not always ideal and may result in needing some Z-Wave repeaters. An improvement would have been wifi in the hub so that it could be placed anywhere. That would also aid pairing since you could take the hub to the device to be paired on battery power and see the result on the app.\n\nI had to unpair a couple of devices that had partially paired the first time around when the hub was unstable. I had to exclude them and then re-include them, meaning the device though it was paired but the hub didn't (but the hub didn't say they were unknown devices, so it sort of did know they were paired, but not properly).\n\nI still have several more devices to pair but it's looking good, easier to use and better Z-Wave range than Vera. Certain aspects of the UI do seem odd but you can tell that it's because it's designed for multiple locations and when you have only one location then some of the UI is a bit superfluous. It's also a pity there's only a phone app and no iPad/tablet app. The phone app looks a bit naff when scaled on a tablet.\n\nAs well as pairing with Z-Wave devices I use the MyQ app to pair with my LiftMaster garage door. https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-myq-liftmaster-chamberlain/8939\n\nOne site that may be of use to others is RBoy's apps page. I intend to use the Foscam camera device and camera motion alarm. http://smartthings.ramitbhalla.com\n\nPreviously:\nMine appears to be defective. Most of the time it's offline and inactive, then it tells me it's updating and just occasionally it works, but less than 20% of the time. It's up and down more than a whore's draws! Most of the time it won't pair, but just occasionally, as if to give you hope and not send it back it succeeds in pairing. I'm going to send this one back but I'll try a second to see if I just got a defective unit. I still have hope that this thing might work properly, we'll see when the replacement comes (but they're out of stock at the moment)."}

This \"thing\" is the most frustraiting POS ever made and forced upon man. Seriously. IT-IS-TERRIBLE!!! The hub is fine. It just sets there, takes up a little bit of space and speaks z-wave and zigbee, but only when it feels like it...\n\nThe biggest problem with smartthings is the horrid user interface in the form of a smartphone app. I have the iOS version and it is utter s***.\n\nThe smartthings developers must have taken UI programming in hell by the worlds most evil sadist, perhaps satan himself? Whoever taught these guys how to build a UI needs to be exiled to space or the bottom of the ocean where they cannot harm humanity any further.\n\nSeriously, if you like icons that mean nothing to anyone and drill down menus within drill down menus that lead anywhere but common sense, where your sure to find nothing but madness and rubber rooms, then maybe this is for you. I'd rather screw sheetrock screws into the bottoms of my feet slowly than deal with looking at that app any longer. It is MADDENING!!! I've seen fewer things in my day less intuitive than the \"smart\" things app. Them even using the word \"smart\" with anything involving this junk makes me angry. Break stuff angry. Think office space and the printer, but replace the printer with the hub...\n\nThey could fix this a little bit perhaps by offering software that runs on a computer where things could be layed out in some manner that is quick and easy, but no, that is for their \"IDE\" that allows for writing your own smart apps, which is cool. I actually think that it's a great feature and I've used it to incorporate my alarm system, but day to day useage and managing everything that matters is only available in that horribly frustraiting app that seems to be designed to make you cry.\n\nSince smartthings was acquired by Samsung, I was hoping they would get some talent and oversight that might help the situation, but no, they just release new versions of the same madness and B.S. - ugh.\n\nThis is all coupled with the fact that logging into the IDE isn't even on the main freaking smartthings webpage. No, they hit you with advertising, and then you poke around aimlessly until you find the login is under the \"shop\" menu - you know, in case you want to buy more madness... And logging in? Maybe you will get lucky and your password works, OR you get told your login is wrong and you have to reset your password... And then mayyyybeeee it'll let you login. Maybe. Sure you don't want to buy something first? App is the same thing, log out, try to log back in, no dice, incorrect login... Change password, maybe it'll let me in, probably not for a few more tries.\n\nSometimes the door will unlock when it's supposed to, sometimes it won't, sometimes my wife's phone will show she's left home, sometimes is probably never most of the time. Outdoor lights on during the day, sure, why not... Maybe they won't come on during the night. Hey, why don't we unlock the front door when no one is home and everyone is miles away? Anything goes!\n\nYeah, home automation \"can be like that\" but with smartthings, it is only ever \"like that\". You are guaranteed to suffer, to be frustrated, to be angry, pull your hair out, curse, scream, hover over the hub, cackling madly, holding a claw hammer and speaking in tongues about bad things, very bad things.\n\nI would seriously smash my hub into a thousand pieces and light those pieces on fire if my wife hasn't threatened to have me committed if I do....\n\nMy best advise is to save yourself and buy a brick, like and actual brick used for construction and put it wherever you would have placed your smartthings hub, and if you ever find yourself about to buy into smartthings, take the brick and smash one of your fingers, hard, and consider that pain, and then rethink buying into smartthings...\n\nI am not a Luddite, I am an electronics technician who is versed in several programming languages and works on multimillion dollar systems on a daily basis. I understand the technology. I understand mesh networks and zwave and sometimes needing repeaters, and geofences and \"solar flares\" sometimes disrupting RF etc. But I do not understand how a company who got bought by someone as big as Samsung can get away without a \"house cleaning\" when they release crap like this and have as many problems getting it together.

For the first day, Alexa was control my TV with my voice. It was great! Come next day, I get a lovely message on my phone that the hub was inactive. Sure enough, checked the hub and no light. There was no activity light on the ethernet cable. Read on the support pages and followed their FAQs and my hub was dead. No biggie, request a new one from Amazon. This is why I love shopping at Amazon. Waited two days again and got another Hub. Same thing... Installed and once again, TV was working flawlessly with Alexa in controlling my TV. Next day arrives again, another lovely message on my phone, hub inactive. WTF?! Same behavior!! the Hub seems to be unresponsive! This time, I sent an email out to SmartThings support. Still haven't heard from them. I'm going to wait for one more day. If I dont hear from them, I'm just going to request a refund!\n\n****Update****\nAmazon and Smartthings worked collaboratively in helping me figure out the issues I was having. Turns out, I had a bad power supply. When I received my hub replacement, I replaced everything except for the power supply. So my issues continued even with the new hub. And to be clear the first hub was not the problem. The reason why it would work one day and fail the next was because it was running on batteries. When in battery mode, you only have about 12 hrs before it kills battery. Hence why the next morning my hub seemed to be non responsive. After working with Smartthings support, we identified the issue and they shipped me out a new power supply immediately.\n\nThe hub is working flawlessly, specially when paired with Echo!

Not only did some of them work faster and worked as consistent as I expect out of a home automation system but some devices like my smartstrip and other zwave sensors displayed data like battery remaining and power consumption, I was not missing the wink platform at all now. One thing they advertised with the v2 smartthings hub is they run some apps locally so not every request has to go to the cloud this is very noticeable with the wink platform there would be times lights wouldn't even come on or when they were working there was the noticeable delay duty to other having to go out to the cloud and was very inconsistent.

I had to go back and forth twice for every single device I tried to rename because the screen wouldn't load. Then, once I renamed it and clicked save, it would error out have the time and not save the name. I would have to repeat the process.\n*Dimmer Switches are impossible to use. It has a little circle with a tiny puck on it. When you put your finger on the puck and try to spin it to dim the light, the whole damn screen goes with it. It is ridiculous.\n*I have a Honeywell zwave thermostat and I am unable to control the fan, it is always stuck on auto.\n*Updates from devices are VERY slow. If I turned I light on, I should see an update within a minute on the app. Nope, I never saw it update the true status, I would close the app/open the app, and wait. It still thought my GE switches were in the last state the app left them in. Absolutely useless.\n\nTo top all of that off, you HAVE to use the app for setup and control. Smart Things has a VERY primitive interface on their website to do very basic setup tasks but that is it. No website to truly control it from a PC.\n\nI currently have a Vera 3 which has been reliable over the last 3 years that I have been using it. I was just sick of firmware updates constantly breaking things and no IFTTT support. I wanted something with a cleaner app as well. I REALLY thought Smart Things would be my answer. I think it will be one day, but as of now, Version 2 is a step back from Version 1."}

{"Author": "David D.", "Date": "on September 24, 2015", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great experience so far", "Text": "I delayed buying a V1 hub once I learned about the V2 hub coming out. I have not purchased any other smart hubs so I'm coming at this as a person fresh into the smart home arena. My initial impression is very positive overall. As of now I only have a handful of sensors set up so maybe things will change over time, but for now I am happy with my purchase. Here's my experience.\n\nI get my V2 hub and start the setup through the app. The first time I input my Welcome Code it doesn't accept it so I get a little worried, but on the second try it works. I have already replaced one of my light switches with a GE ZWave switch so I go to add the device to my hub. The switch is about 10 feet away from the hub. The hub is searching for ZWave devices, but cannot see anything even as I push the button on my GE switch which supposedly puts it in pairing mode. I trying moving the hub closer and still no luck. I reset the hub a couple of times and start the pairing process again, but still no luck. I do a little research on the forums, but don't really get any helpful info. I go try to pair one more time and suddenly it works. I don't think I did anything differently than before, but I was happy to finally get it added. Once it was added I felt the setup for the device was pretty straight forward. I then install a second GE switch and am able to get it paired with my hub on the first try. I then install a GE in-wall electrical outlet, but I cannot get it to pair. I move the hub within 10 feet of the outlet, do multiple resets on the hub and it still cannot see the outlet. After about 20 mins I do a little research on the Internet and learn you can do an \"exclude\" function on the outlet which I think is about like a reset. I do this and am instantly able to pair the outlet with my hub. I install another light switch and it works right away. I then am able to pair a garage door opener on the first try. Finally, I install one last GE light switch identical to the others I have installed. I am able to pair this one immediately, however during the configuration process I keep getting an message saying \"an unexpected error has occurred\" and am not able to finish the configuration on the switch. I am able to control the switch, but it will not allow me to rename it or add it to a room group. I do a little research in the SmartThings forums and learn there is a website you can go to and configure your hub and associated devices (ide.smartthings.com). I go to the website and am able to rename the device and add it to a room group. Initially, though, the light switch does show the correct name in the app, but it still says it is \"Not Configured\". Since the device is fully functional I don't worry about it too much, but I guess my OCD just doesn't like having that \"not configured\" device showing up in my Marketplace. A few hours later, though, I decided to try and run the configuration again and it works. So I'm not sure what the problem was, but it did work itself out.\n\nI have set up a few scheduled events to turn a lamp on and off at certain times and to turn my porch light on and off at sunset and sunrise respectively. Those have worked flawlessly so far. I felt the Smart Lighting was pretty intuitive and easy to work with. Also, you can set up scenes where basically with one push of a button it will do multiple events. So for instance when I push \"Good Night\" it turns off all of my interior lights, but leaves the porch light on. I could also have it do things like lock the doors, but I don't have any smart locks yet.\n\nI will say there is a little bit of a learning curve in the app and it does still need some refinement. For example, why do I go to the \"Marketplace\" to add new devices? That sounds like where I should just buy devices (though you can do that as well). I also wish the app would be a little more useful for troubleshooting connection issues. Saying \"an unexpected error occurred\" doesn't really help much. Is any error really expected? How about telling me something more specific like is the issue with the app or the hub or the device?\n\nObviously, at this point things are still pretty basic for me. I am going to add some more light switches, a couple of motion sensors, and a smoke detector. I will see if I can get lights to react properly with the motion sensors and smoke detector.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my purchase. Despite the small amount of frustration with a couple of the devices I think this thing has great potential.\n\n**Update 9/28/2015** - I am now up to 20 devices and everything is still working well. Most of them are light switches, but I also have a smoke detector and a Foscam that I am using as a motion detector (with a third party smart app). The response time of all my devices has been good, usually no more than a second with the exception of the Foscam. Since I am using a third party smart app for that it processes through the cloud. Any function/scene that uses only approved smart apps and approved devices will process locally and will process a lot quicker, which most of my devices and smart apps are.\n\nThe only real problem I have is when the smoke detector goes off SmartThings hub should send me a text message on my phone and turn on all the lights in my house. The hub does send a text message, but it does not turn on the lights. Other than that, though, I have been able to set up all the other functions I want. I have a couple of motion detectors coming later this week and a garage door opener coming next week so we will see how those integrate.\n\n**Update 9/29/2015** - I just added a couple of motion sensors to my hub. They were easy to connect and work as advertised so now I have a basic security system. If motion is detected while the system is armed I get a text message/push notification on my phone and all of the lights in my house turn on. The hub itself has been working great for me. I will still say the SmartThings app needs a little work to make it a better layout and a little more user friendly, but overall I'm still pleased.\n\n**Update 10/11/2015** - I have added a couple of open/close sensors for my front and rear doors and added my LiftMaster garage door opener. Overall, I am still happy with SmartThings, but I am removing one star and going down to 4 stars. My main issue right now is the SmartThings support. I still have not been able to resolve the issue I mentioned above with the smoke detector. Support takes about 3 or 4 days to reply. I understand they may be backed up on support tickets with the initial launch, but then again doesn't that speak something about the state of the product they launched? My initial support e-mail got a reply within a day, but since then it's been about 3 or 4 days between each e-mail. The support rep keeps asking me questions mostly in quickly written e-mails only a few sentences long. They have only made a couple of quick suggestions, none of which worked and one I had already tried anyway. Basically, at this point support is worthless for me. It is only because everything else I have set up works as I want it to that I'm still satisfied overall with my hub. I truly hope they do not end up alienating a lot of customers due to the excessively long support times. They should have hired more people to cover the initial surge of support tickets that often come with product launches. They also need to get to redesigning the app to make it more user friendly and adding useful features like grouping items together in other categories besides Rooms.\n\n-- UPDATE 12/1/2016\nWhile there have been a few ups and downs with this system overall I would say there are a lot more ups. I am still happy with this and I have seen improvements in reliability and functionality since I first bought this as the SmartThings team continues to make improvements. The app was also redesigned so it is better than before, though it might still need a little polishing to make it a little more user friendly. As I have added several devices since my first review they have all pretty much worked flawlessly. I have added a couple of Hue color bulbs and they work great, though there is a lack of color control for routines. You can change colors manually or for the Alarm function (i.e. they can turn red if the security system goes off), but I cannot find any way to change them through a normal routine. Also, SmartThings will integrate with the Echo so if you spend $50 on and Echo Dot you can have some pretty cool voice control of your home! It's not perfect as it is mostly just basic functionality (I can turn my hue bulbs on/off, but cannot change the color through voice), but it is still pretty useful and fun."}

I read all of the complaints regarding the first generation of the hub. With that being said, it's a great tool to automate your home. So far I have 3 light switches with dimmers connected to the hub. The whole setup process took less than 10 minutes. I am a technical person, and I hate to read the manuals. The hub must be plugged in to you router. In my case, I have it plugged into the 8-port TrendNet switch which connects to the Airport Extreme router. You then need to input the 6 digit product code which is on the back of the manual. After that, the hub quickly found my light switches. Overall my satisfaction is 9/10 so far. I'd like the landing page on the application to point to something different other than \"home security\". As I am currently using another company for my house alarm and smoke/water detection, I find this feature of the app not useful at all. What's great about the app is an ability to download 3rd party apps as well, and use them to create \"themes\". For instance, good bye theme could dim the lights as you're falling asleep and turn them off completely. There are a good 20 other apps that can help you automate lighting alone. Overall I'm a happy camper, and this is definitely what I was looking for plus more!"}

This is my first entry into Home Automation and was paired with a number of GE switches, dimmers, outlets, along with two Nest Protects, some Aeon Labs and Monoprice products.\n\nInstallation was very simple and the first z-wave switch went in with no problem and allowed for control from both Android and Windows Phone straight away. I have since expanded to 20 connected devices and have added automated actions based on sunrise, sunset and specifically timed events. Integration with Amazon Alexa is natively supported and is an amazing benefit as I can turn on and off lights by voice, which is surprisingly useful; e.g. run upstairs and ask Alexa to shut off my office lights that I left on downstairs!\n\nThe capabilities and open nature are a huge plus with this hub over other options; for example, Nest Protects are not natively supported and Windows Phone does not have an official Nest app. Through the community, I was able to add code that provided support for both the wired and wireless Nest Protect and I now have status and can create actions based on the smoke/CO2 detection.\n\nOne of my concerns with a HA hub was performance and consistency of commands. Having read about the, now defunct, Wink hub, people mentioned a fairly consistent 3 second delay. with the SmartThings Hub, whether through the application, automation, or through integration with the Aeon Labs Minimote and Amazon Alexa, actions are immediate. A plus of the second gen hub is local processing, which I have nothing to compare to, but I have already benefited from the battery backup as I had some electric work being done and maintained control of wireless sensors and geo fencing (mobile presence) with no power to the house.\n\nAs you can tell, I am a happy camper. If there is one area that I am excited for, it would be the reported updated app version that is expected sometime in the near future. This came directly from SmartThings staff from the community section of their site. The current app works, but there is room for improvement. Ultimately I will not knock the hub for this as it works fine across platforms and did not use the older app, which I have read had better functionality in areas. I imagine the new app was necessary for the new hub and parity with improved functionality is coming soon."}

I had been a SmartThings 1 Hub / System user for quite some time (and had over 60 \"things\"). I was really apprehensive about upgrading because there is currently no tool for migrating to a new hub, or easy upgrade path. At the same time, I wanted to experience the advantages of the new Hub (i.e. battery backup, works even when Internet Connection down, video capabilities, etc.) so I decided to move forward. In preparation for the migration, I logged into https://graph.api.smartthings.com/login/auth and took some screen shots of my device list (to capture any changes I had made to device types) and also made note of (and captured edit screen for) everything listed as \"in use by\" for the more complicated device setups I had done on the the SmartThings 1 Hub (i.e. - my DSC Alarm System integration, configuration for Garage Doors, etc.). After reviewing this article on the migration process (https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/205956110-How-to-migrate-your-SmartThings-setup-to-Hub-v2) I initiated a chat session with SmartThings support to ask for their assistance on getting started with this process. I worked with a technician named Ryan who was incredibly helpful. In fact, he told me that I could schedule a time to get a dedicated resource to help me with the migration (which I promptly did) and he (Ryan) was assigned to assist me. He spent the the better part of 5 hours helping me get all of my \"things\" properly removed, getting my old hub disassociated from my account, and then getting the new hub up and going . He explained the importance of the sequence in which things should be added, and stuck with me on the phone nearly the entire time. Towards the end, once I had the hang of things on the strategy and process for getting everything added back to the new hub, he had to drop off the call to deal with another scheduled meeting. He promised to call me back after that meeting to make sure I had been able to complete the process and to help me with any remaining issues, which he promptly did. He was able to help me get my final issues resolved and when we got off the phone (which was about 6pm his time on Friday night), my entire system was back up and working again on SmartThings Hub 2.0. I still had a lot of alerting rules, etc. to setup, however, everything was properly setup and communicating with the new Hub. The support I received was way above and beyond what I am used to getting from other companies and I would highly recommend this product (in part) for this reason.\n\nIt has now been a few weeks since I completed the installation and I could not be more pleased with the new product. In addition to being noticeably faster, When a motion detector detects motion or another trigger action occurs (i.e. door opens or closes) the programmed responses are immediate (no perceptible delay). I have already had an unplanned power outage and seen the product work as advertised with battery operated devices (such as my door locks) during the outage. I love the way that everything is grouped together by rooms with the new 2.0 version of their mobile app. By upgrading to the 2.0 version of the hub, I have addressed many of my concerns about the limitations of the system if the power or internet goes down, I also have a faster and more reliable system, and I have laid the foundation for integrating video capabilities for improved home security. In summary > upgrade to the SmartThings 2.0 Hub, it's worth the effort."}

(That is huge because with most technical support you have to go through a call tree and then wait on hold before finally reaching someone reading a script with little technical knowledge of the product.) Anyway, one of the issues was resolved by doing a Z-Wave Network Repair and the other turned out to be a hardware problem with the Z-Wave device. I was extremely impressed with the timeliness of the call and the professionalism and knowledge of Riley, the Support Tech. The only reason I'm not changing my review to five stars is because of the lack of migration support. I was still able to complete the migration in an afternoon, so I can live with that.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI was a V1 user and everything others have said about the painful migration to V2 is true. Samsung provides no path/assistance so it's basically starting over - actually it's a little more difficult than starting over because you first have to disassociate all your devices from the old hub before you start associating them with the new hub. That means you have to dig up manuals for all those devices to ensure you know how to accomplish this.\n\nIn addition to those issues, it appears that the new hub has a shorter range than the old one. I have two devices (Aeon Open/Close Sensor & GE Outdoor Smart Switch) that worked fine before, but don't work with the new hub. I was able to associate them with the new hub but they don't respond to commands. I tested the range by bringing them closer to the hub and they all worked fine. Then I moved them back to their original location and they stopped working again.\n\nAnd finally, all this touting the \"local processing\", I just haven't seen any difference in the speed or reliability of the system because of this.\n\nSo it comes down to whether or not you see the battery backup as a big enough advantage for all the disadvantages. I don't."}

Home automation is a fast-moving, ever-changing world. Not everything is roses. I've been very vocal at times when things weren't working like I wanted them to. But I do believe SmartThings is the way to go. They are ahead of the curve and their products are becoming more varied, stable, and robust.\n\nA warning to Hub1 users who might not have heard this - there's no migration process for moving your devices from the hold hub to the new one. They are working on a migration tool, but it doesn't exist yet. If the prospect of uninstalling all your SmartApps, then devices, then resinstalling them one at a time sounds too daunting, hold off for now.\n\nBut I got my hub up and running with minimal effort and had migrated about 70 devices over a weekend. Everything is working as well (or better) than it did before."}

You can do your own research but from my own experience, the SmartThings Hub is a lot easier to setup, so far it's working great so it's more reliable. The respond is faster too when you turn on and off your lights. There is a delay with the wink hub for me when I turn on and off my lights with GE in wall switches."}

They are sending out $100 white bricks and not acknowledging it nor do they have the support capability to handle the demand right now as they have disabled their live chat.\n\nI just had to personally return mine after wasting hours trying to figure out what the heck was wrong with this thing. I don't know if linking is allowed here but just do a google search for \"stuck setting up hub\" with the quotation marks and the forum thread is the first result.

If you want to deal with a company that only offers support via e-mail (with turnaround times greater than 2 days) then you should go for this hub.\n\n2. I purchased the hub and they ended up sending defective units to a number of customers- The MAC addresses on the NICs of these units do not register correctly with smartthings. In the end, what you have is a brick sitting there with a green light and you can't do anything with it.\n\n3. Their support is slammed... if you have an extensive setup, I guarantee that you will run into problems migrating from whatever else platform or even the v1 hub. Forget about hearing back from their support in team in any decent amount of time. I have yet to hear back from them. Smartthings dropped the ball on this v2 hub launch- they do not have enough support staff to handle the overflowing number of issues. Just check out their forums.\n\nEDIT: They did just now offer to replace the hub with expedited shipping and threw in a free sensor for the trouble.\n\nEDIT 2: Changing rating to 4 stars: I was overnighted a new hub and I am glad to report that while my initial experience with the defective hub was disappointing, after receiving the new device (and the free multi sensor that they threw in for the inconvenience), the hub lives up to the expectations. The response times on the devices is much faster than the old hub and setting it up was a breeze. Their support, while slow, did end up taking care of the issue I had earlier... I just wish they had more support staff to deal with the huge influx of new users to this platform and the general v2 launch. In the end, the hub does work well and the integrations and community that Smartthings has is pretty much unmatched (except for maybe OpenHAB)."}

I have a mish-mash of items such as Hue bulbs, Zwave dimmers/switches, Smartthigns water sensors, Sonos, amazon echo/alexa and even an IR blaster to control the TV via a Smartapp that i wrote..... So effectively, i was ALL IN on Smartthings and spent Hours and Days setting up a house with sensors in the attic and every conceivable room in the house.\n\nNow here comes the new HUB. I ordered it because i figured performance might be a little better and it might have some cool new features i could leverage. I get the new hub, plug it in and i figured it would upgrade my old stuff to the new hub.... WRONG.... After a contacting support ( Have to give the support guys kudos... they are very helpful ) I was told that you have to delete every thing you had and start everything from scratch ... you have to remove all your smart apps, locations, Macros,Nest integration, etc...... And of course the device discovery with the new hub isn't working.\n\nAt this point i feel like the product managers at Smartthings are completely disrespectful of my time. When you sat around the table to discuss upgrade i can't believe you thought to yourself... forget the customers , their time and investment in the platform isn't worth protecting...\n\nShame on you for disrespecting your customer's time.\n\nI can't wait to see what Google/Nest does with the REVOLV acquisition , because i will be first in line to switch over.\n\nSorry Smarttings, You just lost your biggest fan and frankly former product advocate and evangelist..."}

If you own a v1 hub you will NOT be able to migrate your devices to the v2 hub without manually removing and excluding (where necessary).\n\nOn top of that this migration process is broken and ST was aware of this before shipping these new hubs. Many users have spent 10 hours or more just getting things moved only to find out that clearing out the old hub fails with errors (meaning you cannot add your new v2 hub to your account) so they (including myself) have to sit and wait however many days it's going to take for ST support to respond to an email to \"clean out our profile.\"\n\nIt's clear all of this was known before shipping but never made clear to purchasers until after receiving their units.\n\n(If you are a v1 hub user) Pass on this one (for now) or you will be in for a ton of headache."}

SmartThings also seems to have more and better maintained apps than Vera does for UI7. For devices/services that aren't officially supported (such as MyQ or Nest), there's an awesome developer community with apps / plugins available to manually install--I found this manual installation process to be pretty easy (though I'm in IT, so maybe I'm biased).

{"Author": "Jason", "Date": "on September 7, 2015", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "One of the best that are out there right now - But the HA sector needs Improvement!", "Text": "Let me start by saying I enjoy this product. I love HA, and tinkering.\n\nIn the Home automation industry I own: Amazon Echo (BTW buy this now!), Samsung SmartThings Hub, VeraLite, Wink, and Harmony Hub.\n\nSome of these work in conjunction with others, some don't. There are a lot of immature developing systems in the industry- there are ups and downs to all of them.\n\nWhat this is not:\nThis is not a system for the light hearted. This is not a system for non-technical persons that won't spend the time to get it the way they want. This is not an inexpensive hobby.\n\nThis is not a \u201cHome Control Device\u201d\n\nWhat it is:\nA means to Automate anything your heart desires. You may need a little know how, patience, and ingenuity but just about anything is possible. Just because I said it\u2019s possible does not mean it\u2019s inexpensive or easy. Some things will take a lot of work to do the way you want.\n\nThis is a \u201cHome Automation Device\u201d\n\nPros:\nIf you like to tinker, you can automate just about anything with a little know how, and patience. They have an amazing developer community that will likely jump at your problems and many will offer to code things for you.\n\nDevices are pretty easy to add and automate as long as they are on the officially supported list. This list seems to make pretty good progress, they are continually adding items.\n\nI cannot say enough about the many, many helpful community members, but please Search topics, and try to find your probably already answered questions!\n\nI have never personally contacted support, but am told that they are extremely helpful.\n\nSince I\u2019ve had it the box seems like it's been pretty reliable.\n\nI am by no means a coder - but it is relatively easy to add non-officially supported devices with the help of many tutorials on the community site (they are also currently being cross referenced and organized into a non-official community driven Wikipedia!)\n\nAmazon Echo Integration - I can tell Alexa to turn on or off any of my lights, it\u2019s Greatly increased WAF.\n\nLogitech Harmony Integration - I can set up automations to dim lights when watching tv at night, turn them up when paused, etc. (I haven't personally gotten into this yet, because it is not user friendly according to community. But I will be working on it soon when I have time.\n\nLogitech Harmony Controlled through Echo - Yes you can set it up so that you can tell Alexa to Start Movie mode, Turn on the DVD player dim the lights start the popcorn, Again told it's not user friendly but I will be getting into this when I have time.\n---\nCons:\nThere is not TOTAL local control. You have to have an internet connection to run anything that is not official supported for sure - this likely won't ever change.\nIn particular this makes using ST as a DIY security system (which they are currently trying to market it as) iffy at best. On this same subject there I am not using st in this manner Strictly because the system isn't mature enough. Look at the community posts about this if it\u2019s your intended use. Presence Tags, Beacons, locks, and Keypads desperately need more support and the only thing that would make me use it in this manner with a Siren (#2 in b/e deterrent) is local control over all security devices including locks. However to quote a community member \"My use case is not your use case\". You may find \"enough\" support/workarounds for your specific use case.\n\nThere are only 3 officially supported ZigBee repeaters and they aren't cheap. You're looking at $55.00/ea. to extend your ZigBee mesh if needed. The plus side is Lowes may have some lesser expensive repeaters coming out that if not officially supported the community will inevitably unofficially support (have I mentioned they're awesome?). In contrast you can expand your Z-Wave mesh for ~$25.00/ea.\nHaving a strong mesh can reduce: system lag, devices not updating, and presence problems and it can increases: range, stability, and battery performance. Many community problems (devices not working properly/reliably, battery life to name a few) are due to weak mesh.\n\nMany of their \"Officially supported\" device types do not offer all of what the device has to offer. For instance I am using an unofficial device type for my lock because the official one cannot handle assigning opening codes/management. Therefore I lose local control. This is a common occurrence, and mostly targets \"power users\" so I don't believe it's high on their list atm.\n\nCurrently you cannot add multiple users.... This is Huge - My WAF was extremely low because I moved from a system where she had her own user and now does not. ST has said it's \"working on it\", but other than that there is no eta.\n\nConclusion:\nFor the technologically inclined:\nThis is a Great system. There currently isn\u2019t another system as Open as them with the same protocols. They are the furthest along in this regard. In my opinion they\u2019re setting the bar for the power user that others should strive for, but it is an admittedly low \u201cofficial bar\u201d. And is just high enough with the \u201cUnofficial community support\u201d. If they didn\u2019t have the community it would be much worse than Iris, Wink, or Staples.\n\nFor the Average Joe:\nThis is a pretty good option. If you stick close to official device types and smartapps you will do just fine. You will be able to automate many things. If you wish to tinker a little bit you can do a few more. Or if you are willing to ask for help/search a forum/wiki for answers you will be able to learn some fun things about HA.\n\nFor the Un-Technological Folk:\nThis could go either way. Even if you stick to the Official device types and smartapps you will probably need to read a FAQ or Two to get started. It isn\u2019t that difficult to do basic automations\u2026 But the easy ones to create may not do what you desire. It will take some time to set up, but it isn\u2019t difficult.\n\nFor the Plug and Player:\nStay far far away. If you are not willing to spend a little time to set up and familiarize yourself this system is not for you. Do not walk\u2026 Run away from this system. If you are still interested in HA talk to the nearest professional installer."}
