The stairs are located midpoint between the front and rear of the house. The third one was placed in the basement, near a wall not far from the bottom of the stairs.\nAs everyone else has already mentioned, set up was a breeze.\nTHE SIGNAL IS STRONG THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HOUSE! Multiple devices (cell phones; laptops; wireless security cameras; Netflix streaming on TV's).\nAll I can say is that the Google WiFi network setup works great.\n(My previous setup was three hard-wired routers located in similar locations. Signal strength from routers was nowhere near as good as Google WiFi)\nKudos Google!"}

I set up and administered the network myself. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I heard from my kids, \u201cDad, the Internet is slow\u201d, or from my wife, \u201choney, can you fix the internet?\u201d Uggg - wrestling with IT was the last thing I felt like doing after a long day\u2019s work. After countless firmware upgrades and researched tweaks to the configuration, the fix seldom lasted more than a few days.\n\nI have since ripped out the Linksys routers and replaced it with the google WiFi system (keeping my cable modem). Since that time, everything just works! Not a single problem. If you were to ask my family, I single handedly fixed the internet ; ). Thank you Google!"}

{"Author": "DaveHopf", "Date": "on August 25, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Easier to configure than expected", "Text": "I am definitely liking the Google WiFi. Even with all of the hype, it still exceeded my expectations. The installation is as close to plug and play as could be imagined for a WiFi router. I will skip repeating the setup steps and hype and focus on my experience setting it up. This was not my first rodeo with WiFi routers, but it is my first exposure to the Google WiFi.\n\nRight out of the box, I wasn't going to install it immediately, so I plugged it into the existing router switch just to poke around. This was a mistake because 2 months later when I actually got around to installing it, I forgot and fired up the Google WiFi App and let it configure with it plugged into the switch and not the cable modem. It configured ok but not correctly. I ended up resetting the router with the phone app and started over.\n\nThis time I completely unplugged and removed the existing router and plugged the Google router directly into the cable modem as per the instructions. I restarted to mobile app, typed in the details and it was done. Then I reconnected all of my devices and when I did, the mobile app prompted me to share the password! I have a long and complex WiFi password, and it was so cool to share it with the press of a button- instead to the ordeal of manually typing it in. On the connecting device, the password was automatically entered and the device connected successfully! Well played, Google.\n\nI already a DHCP server and I was frustrated to discover that I could not disable DHCP on the Router's LAN settings. I suppose there may be a work around, but I didn't bother. I was so impressed overall, I elected instead to disable my DHCP server and let the router manage that service instead. This seems to have been a good decision that saved a lot of hassle.\n\nKeep in mind that many wifi routers have a built in switch that allows you to plug in 3 or 4 hardwired ethernet cables. The Google wifi does not have a built in switch. Instead it has only one extra ethernet port and you can use that port to connect to a downstream switch for the other ethernet cables. A 5-port unmanaged switch can be had for under $20.\n\nAnother cool feature is the router's ability to focus the wifi signal in the direction of the connected devices. This is probably why the router does not have any wall mount options as the unit likely needs to sit on a horizontal surface and not a vertical one. With this in mind, I really needed to mount the router on the wall, and I came up with a simple solution using a thin cord, as shown in the accompanying photo. If there is a difference in signal strength, vertical vs horizontal, it isn't detectable in our environment.\n\nI can't say that my internet is any faster than before. Subjectively it seems perhaps slightly improved, but my previous router worked great, too. The difference being a much better user experience overall and the ability to add more routers as needed. This router is much better than any other router I have ever used in the past. Some of my previous routers cost well over $200 and this router beats them hands down."}

Solved my previous home wifi issues", "Text": "The Google WiFi system has exceeded my expectations. I've always had problems in the house with my internet. My TV would frequently freeze when streaming movies or videos. My computer would just freeze sometimes, and I had a few weak areas in the house. I'd do speed tests and be lucky to get 16 - 20mbps, when my ISP promised over 100 mb. If I plugged my computer directly into the modem I would regularly get 115 mbps. I also have a large outdoor deck and living area, and a mother-in-law home on the property. We had to have two internect connections to feed the entire property. My hope was that this Mesh system would allow me to place the transmitters in the house, in a shed in the back yard, and then reach the apartment in the back yard. These worked so well that I was actually able to bridge the gap to the apartment home without having a hub outside at all. It reaches fine from a window in the back of our house to a window in the kitchen of the apartment. This saves my mother-in-law nearly $ 80 / month in internet costs. That will make it pay for itself in about 4 months. She only uses a tablet, and occasionally streams a movie. The signal to her apartment is full signal strength, and the speed has only degraded to about 75mbps, so it's great. All through my house I get the full 115mbps speed and everything works great! We do have quite a few devices on our network and no problems yet. This was recommended to me by someone else who made the switch, and I'd recommend it to anyone!"}

There was a lot of moving things around to get a better signal with my old single router, and plugging things directly into the router itself, because the wifi was so slow.\n\nWith this solution I now have a crazy good signal throughout the house, and I no longer experience any slowdowns or interruptions in service. I haven't had to do much after connecting this system, it just works. Highly recommended!\n\nI have 200MB down/10MB up and it's great with that speed."}

The coverage has been good and I like the phone app access. However, I recently purchased from Amazon for a remodel home. The whole project was delayed for about 2 months. So by the time I was ready to set up the wifi the return period had expired. I didn't worry about it knowing I had set it up before and didn't have problems. Not so this time. It seemed to go smoothly and working appropriately displaying the white light. However, after 15-20 minutes the internet would crash. And not in a way that I had ever experienced. Every website like google, amazon, netflix, would go to an error page. And the strangest thing was as I would restart the router by disconnecting, resetting up the wifi point, and reconnecting the network, there might be a couple different error messages after that 15-20min of working appropriately. I struggled by myself for awhile then found their customer service number. I called and talked with a technician for 2 hours. After several trial and error methods, it worked. I hung up, but then 20 minutes later...it stopped again. So I called back, another technician walked me through a few more methods for 2 more hours. And he was easy to understand and helped walk me through each step. Because it had a history of stopping after 20min I told him this and he sent me an email so I could email him if it stopped again, which was very nice. So I hung up after doing things like diagnostic reports and setting different ip reservations. 25 minutes later, it stopped again. So I emailed him. They called a day later. I talked with a third technician for 2.5 hours and again no fix we could find. They said they were 'elevating the matter'. That meant he couldn't help me but passed on my information and reports to someone else that could read some of the reports he had me create. A week later I got another call, this triggered another hour long call that walked me through almost all of the stuff I had done many times by now. Again he said he would be 'escalating the matter'. I received an email the next day with a few things to try. Unfortunately all of the things they wanted me to try were impossible because I only have a chromebook and chromebase as my home devices and neither has an LAN port. So they emailed back a workaround. I worked on doing those reports yesterday and sent them back. No response yet. I feel like I'm doing their work for them and I seriously deserve a new router. I feel stuck because I really want to like it. But in order to do anything I had to ask for a rental router from the ISP company so I could actually email them the reports they wanted while the router acted up. I want the mesh network and don't want to spend another 200 for a different brand but I totally will if they keep me on the phone for another couple hours with no results. Amazon's return window should be longer for things like this."}

{"Author": "Chris Rogers", "Date": "on August 20, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "WiFi Done Right and Made Simple", "Text": "Since the dawn of wifi, I've been one of those people that somehow perpetually lives in places where wireless networks aren't as simple as they should be. I have way more experience than I would like to have had with DD-WRT and the old blue Linksys routers and access points, creating bridged networks, running ethernet cables through ceilings to try to mitigate distance with wires instead of wireless, ethernet through power outlets, and heaps of other workarounds because it just won't work out of the box. All of this to say I'm fairly tech-literate, and have been able to create solutions, but it's never been simple or easy for the layperson.\n\nMy current condo is a perfect one bedroom, two story, 1,000 sq ft space, with cable for modem downstairs, and despite the small size of the condo, just enough shielding between the first and second floor to make for abysmal wifi upstairs. Built in the 70s, it lacks any original in-wall cabling, and after spending hours trying to get WAPs work, last year I gave up and just ran an ethernet cable up the stairwell with tape, planning to run it in a wall during an eventual remodel.\n\nThen mesh wifi happened, and after watching the very positive reports for a few months, I jumped on two of the Google routers. One sits next to the cable modem at my desk near the bottom of the stairs, the other sits on a handrail at the top of the stairs. For the first time in my life, I experienced out of the box plug-and-play success with wireless internet.\n\nThe app is simple and easy to understand, and I appreciate the ability to view what's happening with my network from anywhere in the world. Enable and disable devices, create priorities, check network health, it's all at the touch of a finger.\n\nOne of the reasons I went with Google's system is that each router has the ability to be the primary connected to the modem, but also includes a LAN plug for wired devices. My original Xbox One has a pretty awful wireless card, and won't pull more than 30 Mbps even with direct line of sight to a router. With Google's system, the Xbox is plugged into the second mesh router, enabling wired performance over a wireless connection.\n\nGoodbye complex internet, and hello \"It just works!\""}

What a modern home wifi system ought to be", "Text": "Bought this 3-unit system to replace a failing (after only 4 months) CISCO RV320 router and some separate b/g/n access points. Unpacking and installation took only about 15 minutes, including removing old equipment. Setup, including changing LAN SSID and IP ranges from default back to my previous LAN settings, setting up about a dozen IP reservations, and renaming some connections, took perhaps 45 minutes including learning time. The system works perfectly, coverage is outstanding (nowhere in the house is less than -60db), data rates are between 100 and 250+ Mbps for every connected device (my maximum internet download rate is only 80 Mbps, so this is overkill!). The iPhone app that controls it is excellent, and lets me do things like see the current and historical (up to 60 days past) data usage up and down for every connected device, and test the current up and down rates for each connected device. Works just fine with my parallel Sonosnet wireless music network \u2013 no interference on either net. Has lots of other features I don\u2019t need, like guest networks, family restrictions, UPnP, IPv6, port forwarding, bridge mode, short-term priority settings and the like.\n\nI put one node in my media cabinet, connected it (each mesh unit has two Ethernet ports) to a simple 5-port Ethernet switch, and hardwired my Roku, DVD player and receiver to it to bypass their less than stellar built-in wifi. Movie streaming is now perfect. HD movies require about 5-6 Mbps \u2013 and I am delivering 100+ Mbps with this setup. And besides all that the mesh units are small, uncluttered, unobtrusive, and even stylish, which my wife appreciates."}

Going to return this for an Orbi AC3000 RBK50, which seems to be the optimal system right now. Will update with side-by-side results from the Orbi."}

Most is the keyword here; agree with other reviewers that if you are running an advance home network with NAS, servers, smart home devices you'd better get professional strength equipment. Worked perfectly for my house though.\nThe biggest advantage of mesh over traditional routers is that you don't have to worry about 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks. One is slower and other one has shorter range and my phone had never switched seamlessly when I walk around the house leaving. I don't wan't to know about this, I don't want to configure this, just make it working and Google did exactly that.\nI have 100MB/s internet from my provider and all of this speed is available in most of the house, I have a couple of corners where speed drops to 40MB/s (guess this is when it switches to 2.4GHz).\nMy only beef with this system is inability to hide SSID. I have read many responses to this complain - Google says hidden SSID doesn't make your network more secure. I get it and agree with that but this is a privacy issue for me, not security:\n1. I don't want to advertise my network to the neighbors\n2.

After a similar retry I just connected another one directly to the modem. The setup worked perfectly. Then I tried to attach the other two from the other rooms. Similar situation happened, the router hung. Eventually realized I have to setup in the room of the active router to be close and move the new ones to the final room later.

I also wanted something that didn\u2019t look like a traditional router\u2014they typically are eye-sores. The Google WiFi router fits the bill for both items.\n\n##Modular\nI also wanted something that could handle a bigger space if I moved. This seems like the perfect solution. In the past Wifi extenders have been complicated to use and rarely worked as advertised. Although I can\u2019t attest to how his system performs, it appears to be simple to set up with the phone app at any time.\n\n## Setup\nSet up was very easy, if you get their phone app for iOS or Android. I was done in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guest WiFi\nI really like that I can stipulate which IoT devices guests can interface with via the network. I\u2019m sure other systems have this, but were too complicated to set up for me to consider.\n\n## App\nWell made app lets me change settings like passwords, guest accounts, and the LED light brightness. I also like that I may see what\u2019s going on anywhere I am. There is a family setting that lets you cut off internet for members of your family.\n\n## Actual tech support\nKnowing I can message or talk to someone if something goes wrong is a huge plus. Haven\u2019t needed to call, so I can\u2019t comment on the quality of service.\n\n# Con (and subjective thoughts)\n## Privacy Paranoia\nI feel ambivalent about linking the router with my Google account. This seems to require a Google account. So, if you don\u2019t have a Google account, then that might add an extra layer of complexity and time. Also, despite the app assuring me everything collected is done so anonymously, I struggle to believe an ad business like Google, which lives off of what it collects on its users, can be completely trusted on this front. Paranoia\u2014probably. I don\u2019t intend to do anything illegal or embarrassing on my network, so fine I guess. But, total privacy and security is an illusion, especially if you buy something like this from the king of data collection. So just realize what could go wrong, even if Google vows to keep everything safe. I\u2019m sure someone who actually read the terms in full could school me on this topic. In that case a brief summary would be appreciated. In any case, I wish Google could explain to me more plainly what it intends to collect; otherwise, I\u2019m sure a lot of us will assume less than benign activity."}

My VOIP phone (Ooma) had become practically useless, as had my Roku and Fire TV boxes. I blamed my ISP (always the easiest thing to do) but decided to swap out my highly-reviewed router with this Google thing to see how many of my problems (if any) were caused my old router.\n\nThey were ALL caused my old router. Or if not caused, they were cured by this Google device. I've had no connectivity issues at all - none! - since the absolutely painless installation of this thing. I did have to add a TP-Link network switch (ASIN=B00A128S24) so I could plug in a few items, and I was worried that the magic would die as soon as I threw that into the mix. Nope. No issues at all. The switch is literally plug and play. I ran a cable from the Google WiFi output to port 1 of the switch, then connected my other items to other ports on the switch and that is all.\n\nThis single Google Wifi is effortlessly supporting a desktop PC (hardwired thru the switch), several devices connected thru powerline adapters (Roku, FireTV, laptops) and several wireless devices (tablets, phone, printer, smart doorbell, Amazon Echo). It's inside a closed cabinet at one end of my one-story, 1300sf house. Wireless devices at the extreme opposite end of the house have perfect connectivity. I routinely connect to my workplace's computing environment thru a VPN and that has been chronically unreliable, but no more. Video streaming was similarly frustrating before, but it's a joy now.\n\nI've begun to think of Google as leaning more and more toward the Dark Side and kinda wish I didn't like this product so much, but wow...what a fine piece of work this is!"}

Unfortunately, you can only prioritize a single device for up to four hours, which only guarantees a connection to WiFi calling for that single device for that set period of time. Otherwise, the three adults in our home who need a dependable connection to WiFi calling are sometimes not connected to that service while the kids' phones are (the kids almost never make phone calls, so WiFi calling is not as important). There is no way to prioritize the adults' phones permanently, and we sometimes miss important phone calls because Google WiFi randomly assigns priority to other devices. It is so frustrating that I am actively searching for other systems that allow me more control over device prioritization. Too bad, too, as the system is great in all other areas.\n\nLack of QoS control is a deal breaker."}

(Plus that model ended up on the list that was vulnerable to the VPNFilter hack). We have a 1500 sqft ranch with a full basement, the previous router was centrally located in the great room, almost the center of the house. The Amazon Fire Stick on our TV in the basement that the kids use would often flake out on us.\n\nThe main access point is in place of the old router, and then there is one is the basement room near the TV with the Fire Stick, and the third is in a bedroom at the other end of the house. I probably could have just used two to cover our space, but it was a 3 pack and I had all three up and running in about 20 minutes. I used the same router name and password so all of my smart devices hopped on without any issues. The app is pretty easy to use, and I had no problems following along. The app also has diagnostic tools to check your device connections, your internet speed, and the connections between the mesh points.\n\nI have my Xbox One connected to the main hub in the great room via an Ethernet cable to ensure it has a stable and fast connection. Through the app you can set one device as a priority device for 1,2, or 4 hours. Any device on the network regardless of how it is connected. I am not entirely sure how the prioritization works, because I have noticed some hard lag spikes when other devices are downloading or doing a lot of streaming. Technically there is enough bandwidth for the Xbox which doesn't use all that much, but the other devices are using much more. When my internet is running well I can usually get an average of 20Mbps. In general this isn't an issue, but I did not have these issues before moving over to the mesh network. It would be nice if prioritizing a device would throttle other devices or reserve extra bandwidth for the priority device as a buffer.\n\nOverall if you just want great coverage across your space, a simple setup and don't want to tinker with a lot of network settings to get it to run right, this is a great product for you. The app is easy to use and you can check on your network from your phone from anywhere (which is how I realized the power got knocked out at my house before I got home one day). Updates and security handled by Google pushing out updates instead of having to know how to flash your router is also a plus.\n\nIf you're really serious about gaming or you like to tweak every last setting on your equipment to get the best performance possible, you probably want a different setup, a gaming router and network extender may suit you better.\n\nPros\n- Super simple setup\n- Great Consistent Coverage\n- Useful and easy to use app for keeping an eye on your network from anywhere, running diagnostics, and setting device priority\n\nCons\n- Could benefit from an option to throttle non-priority traffic\n- Some intermittent lag when your network is using a lot of bandwidth"}

Google Wifi allows you to choose a priority device, but there's a catch... you can only choose one priority device and for a limited time (max of 4 hours). What does that mean for you? It means more important devices like your home security system or smart thermostat could be bumped off the Wifi network because of other competing devices in your home. I don't know about you, but I want my home security system to be the priority device over Netflix. Bottom line... you're not going to get anything special or amazing here.

Happily, we had installed tons of Cat5e cabling in the house when we renovated it. After some investigation I decided to move to a mesh router system with wired backhaul, and decided to use Google wifi because of its simplicity and because it supports wired connections. I had to purchase and install a new modem (our old one was getting close to \"end of life\" according to Comcast) and re-do the terminations on our Cat5e cabling to change it from phone line to ethernet compatible, which took a bit of work. Virtually all of the tools, jacks, panels, switch etc were purchased from Amazon, but the Google wifi was purchased from Costco ($300 for four).\n\nSetting up the Google wifi was a breeze - very similar to how Apple products just work out of the box. I looked at the youtube videos and did as they said - start with one and follow the instructions exactly; do not try to jump the gun at all. Set it up wirelessly first, then hard wire the units. It came up beautifully, in wireless mode. Then I put the units in their long term locations and plugged in the ethernet to each unit, and then all of them into the switch. Voila! Great speeds, very reliable connection. I haven't plugged the TVs into the system yet but it should work. I should mention that my old router was an Apple Time Capsule. I decided to continue to use it as the backup device (with Time Machine) so I disabled the wifi on the Time Capsule, put it in bridge mode, and hard wired it into one of the google wifi satellite points. It works just fine. Since Apple has stopped making new TIme Capsules, I figure the Google wifi will future-proof our system for a while, though we may need to get a new NAS at some point.

Mine is installed on the top floor at the front of the house, and downstairs at the back the house, I still get a good signal.\n\nI also like the simplified security of these devices, as Google says that updates get pushed to the device automatically. So no more logging into the router, downloading some mystery firmware, and hoping that the update doesn't brick the thing. While I am moderately tech-savvy, when it comes to my home network, I just want to \"set it and forget it\" while still having a fast and secure network, so that was a big plus for me. Deduct one (maybe even two) stars if you like tinkering under the hood of your router.\n\nSetup was easy. I found Google's setup app to be pretty good, and other than the usual new network equipment hassles (power down the modem+router and then reconnect them one at a time), setup was pretty quick and easy.

{"Author": "merkman", "Date": "on June 25, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Most reliable network purchase in a LONG time!", "Text": "System Technician who doesn't claim to be an \"expert\", but has working in and on computers and networking for 20 years. Netgear devices can be great, but after problems with the 2.4GHz band occasionally dropping on my R7500, and then trouble with the R8000S not staying connected for more than 2 days, requiring a reboot of the router to fix the issue once newer firmware had been applied, I had enough. So after a friend recommended the Google Wifi system, I decided to give it a try.\n\nDespite my running 40+ wifi devices in my condo, it has given me ZERO problems. I can set \"address reservations\" for devices like printers, wifi bridges, and NAS, and then port forward as necessary that equipment. I can update my firmware, see speeds for individual devices, and more. There is a LOT of power there for a consumer device with only two bands, and it works REALLY well. The only thing it DOESN'T have is the ability to do Dynamic DNS updates if my ISP changes my public IP. But I downloaded a Windows app, set that up to update to the web for free, and pointed my inexpensive personal domain name to that. Now I can get to my home computer, NAS, or whatever else I need remotely with network names that are easy to remember and make sense.\n\nReally thought I tri-band router like the newer Netgear R8000S was what I needed with all my equipment. But when you can't keep the internet stable on that device for more than a couple days, the performance doesn't matter. The Google is slower, but not by much, and the reliability and convenience this device provided, all by just setting it up through a cell phone or tablet app... Gold Star Google!

I like the app with the speed tests and other info like connected devices.\n\nCons: If you have more than one unit you are forced to use NAT on the main unit, thus making your entire network a NAT, which in many cases causes it to be a sub-NAT if your router is not bridgeable. Mine is not, AT&T in their infinite wisdom has no way of doing a pure bridge, never a dull moment with AT&T and Comcast, ughh.\n\nSo in my case, I was forced to do the DMZ dance with my AT&T modem, some of you may know that DMZ is NOT the same as a pure bridge between modem and router and let me explain why.\n\nIn a pure bridge ALL traffic in and out, originated within or from outside is just passed to the Main Google Wi-Fi unit, then it handles ALL routing in and out. IN a DMZ ALL ports are pointed to an IP (my Google Wi-Fi main unit), however unlike a pure bridge not all data gets thru like it should.\n\nExample # 1\n\nMy Ryobi garage door opener has an app to open and close it. After I completed setting up my new Mesh network, I could not complete the setup of the garage door opener, the setup process ALWAYS got stock during the setup process, I tried maybe 50 times. For days I thought the GDO was broken, I even started an RMA with Ryobi. I decided that it was FAR too coincidental that it stopped working at the same time as I installed the Google Wi-Fi so I installed my old Apple Airport Extreme Wi-Fi and I hooked it directly to my AT& T modem, thus bypassing the NAT on the Google Wi-FI and BAM! the install worked, and it worked over and over, I tried it several times. * Update, it working on the Apple Airport Extreme could be because the Ryobi GDO only runs 2.4 Ghz and the Google Mesh was so close to the GDO it forced the GDO to use 5 Ghz Wi-Fi (dumbly) and Google Wi-Fi has no way to hard set 2.4 Ghz on any specific Wi-Fi device. -- OR it could be as originally thought, the NAT causing the issue, I am just not sure at this point, either way, this is a problem I did not have prior to installing Google Wi-Fi.\n\nExample #2\n\nI use D-Link Home smart outlets, they offer a scheduling function, example turn lights on at 5 PM and off at 11 PM. This scheduling stopped working when I installed the Google Wi-Fi. If I manually turned a light on or off thru the app it always worked but the schedule for all 5 of these devices stopped working completely. I unplugged them, reset them over and over and nothing fixed it until I also reset them and put them back on my Apple Airport Extreme that was hooked directly to my AT&T modem, BAM the schedule started to work.\n\nSo the moral of the story is this. If you have smart devices in your house, some of those smart devices, probably the older ones, may not work correctly behind the NAT OR maybe 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi ONLY.\n\nEither problem WILL NOT be apparent that it is due to the Google Wi-FI. Basically what I am saying is use basic logic, if devices worked before installing Google Wi-Fi and now they don't work or partially work its highly likely due to double NAT (Network Address Translation) OR your devices only use the 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi spectrum and GW is trying to use 5 Ghz on that device.\n\nIn my opinion, Google needs to let users opt out of the NAT on the Google Wi-FI if we want to allow our modems to continue to be the ONLY NAT. Yes, I know Google, some of the nice app functions like the mesh to mesh speed test won't work right but at least I will be able to open my garage door and turn on my lights.\n\nAt this point, the advantages outweigh the problems and I am moving forward with Google Wi-Fi HOWEVER if I find more surprises I might send it back for a return. I tried the overpriced UB - UNIFI MESH W-Fi system before this and that was really nice but my T-Mobile Wi-Fi calling didn't stay connected on my iPhones when I was home and at the time that problem seemed like a huge problem to me LOL, now its not that bad to be honest and that is where I will go back to if Google Wi-FI does not work out. Lets see.\n\nTo Google, I took the time to tell you in detail where your deficiencies are, both here in this review and directly to you, it is my sincere hope you add a way to turn off the NAT for multiple nodes or figure out why DMZ is not functioning the same as a true bridge and make it work so it does.\n\nThere are / will be a LOT of customers that have smart devices in their homes that don't understand why suddenly some of their stuff stops working and will just give up and send your devices back. I personally think you could have done a better job being compatible with devices, it almost seems like some stubborn decisions were made on your part to force NAT and 5 Ghz on your users Google? Why?\n\nThank You\nRob"}

{"Author": "SB", "Date": "on June 19, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Best Router on the Market!", "Text": "The Google Wifi router is simply amazing! Not only is the design esthetically elegant, the good folks at Google have also made the device intuitively and highly functional. Set up through the Google Wifi app was a breeze and in my case a complete god send since my 2017 MacBook Pro has an essentially nonfunctional ethernet connection despite having purchased a compatible ethernet to usb-c adapter. I repeatedly received the dreaded \u201cself induced IP address and will not connect to the internet\u201d message and wasted hours speaking to various tech reps at Apple and my ISP. It turns out that not being able to establish a connection to the internet with the use of ethernet is apparently a pervasive problem for all newer model macs for which Apple (and its associated forums) has no real solution. This would thus prevent most folks who need a new traditional router from ever being able to install one.\n\nLuckily Google Wifi is one of the only devices out there that doesn\u2019t require a hardwire/ethernet connection in order to set up! After following the simple prompts through the Google Wifi app, my set up was complete after just a few minutes. I immediately noticed that my internet was blazing fast which was confirmed when I completed a speed test. I was getting over 70mbps on downloads despite paying for only 60mbps through Comcast which we all know provides notoriously awful service. Google Wifi also easily recognized all of my devices (iphone, iPad, MacBook, Samsung TV, wireless printer) as soon as they were connected to my Wifi network. The connection has remained extremely fast and consistent without any dead spots or dropped connections. The coverage area has also been true to form as I only purchased a one pack router for my roughly 1200sq ft apartment. However with the beauty of the Google Wifi mesh system, those who have larger or multilevel homes will undoubtedly be able to set up full wireless coverage throughout their home with the use of multiple points.\n\nI enthusiastically recommend this product for anyone looking to replace a traditional router and has basic wireless needs. The only people who seem to be dissatisfied with Google Wifi are techies who create complicated networks and require a high level of customization which this product does not offer."}

The google wifi router updates itself without any need for me to install the update, With the Apple Airport Express, to install the latest (and infrequent) firmware updates, you had to do it manually, while on the network. That the google router updates on its own is Nice for us as we travel for some extended time periods, for a few months in the winter, but need the WiFi on while we\u2019re gone so I can check to make sure the heat is working via the Nest thermostat.\n\nThe airport express had a USB port that I used to connect my networkable but non-WiFi printer, so my wife and I could both print from our computers connected to our home wifi network. So with the google wifi router having no USB, I connected it\u2019s LAN port to a switch, where i plug in the Phillips Hue and now my printer too. So we continue to have the printer available on our network, even though we have a single point set-up, just one google router, so just one LAN port, which goes to the switch.\n\nOne point was plenty for our house of 2,800 sq ft, 1,400 each of two floors. We pay Comcast for 80 Mbps. My speeds with the airport express was about 60 Mbps near the apple router in the lower level to about 40 Mbps upstairs at the furthest point away. This was plenty for me. Installing the google router, you select the location, so I selected \u201cbasement.\u201d Perhaps this helped. Anyway, it\u2019s now 85 Mbps near the router and nearly the same upstairs, right above the router, and 65 Mbps upstairs at the farthest point away.\n\nI\u2019m not so tech savvy when it comes to router settings and networking, so it was nice that set-up is super easy."}

I have a 1Gbps home connection and it usually provides great coverage throughout the house. However, on a daily basis for about 5-10 minutes the connections from all my wireless Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro) stops working. Wired devices work fine however. Pinging the google WiFi router gateway IP shows 2000ms+ latency and many timeouts and any new connections to the internet fails (devices do show it is connected to WiFi network at full strength). This seem to happen when multiple devices are connected and one tries to download many files or a large file. I opened serval support cases with Google regarding the issue and followed nuremous suggestions (factory reset, moving devices changing DNS servers). None of this helped and I had sent many diagnostic reports and they never could fix or acknowledge this as a software or hardware issue. I eventually gave up because they never seemed to believe me this was an issue with their product. They wanted to blame my ISP or other factors unrelated to the issue. Google WiFi support makes it very difficult to get issues escalated to high level support engineers. It took me 6 months a dozen calls and emails to finally get it escalated. At which point they had no solutions. So I decided to try the 2nd generation eero instead and now I never have a single hiccup.

Considering how much wifi crap I now have at the house the improvement in bandwidth and coverage is quite pleasing.

Maybe my hopes were too high.\n\nI was tired of having to constantly reboot my other routers. I tried many... ASUS, Netgear, Buffalo, etc... all of them seemed to need a good kick in the arse fairly periodically, and get worse with age. Plus, I hated having wifi extensions upstairs and having to switch manually between networks. Bring in Google Wifi.\n\nPros: easy to setup, mobile app is easy and simple to use and manage system (maybe too simple), and seamlessly go between any nodes and have it automatically switch you to the best signal.\n\nCons: These still have to be rebooted. Wifi speeds jump all around. One day it'll be great, the next day everyone is experiencing slow speeds and I have to reboot the mesh network. With direct connection to a router, we have 60 mbps download speeds. With the wifi, we're getting around 15. I'm okay with that since that's plenty fast, but wish it was solid and consistent like some of the other reviewers experience. Lastly, and while the simplicity of setup and the admin mobile app is, I also think it's a bit too simple. For many, it won't matter as they may never really need to do anything. For me, I wish I could set a priority device and have it be permanent. The max you can set is 4 hours. I like to game on my PC and need all the bandwidth I can get, so wish I didn't have to do that each and every time. Also wish I could go to any device on the network and simply limit the bandwidth, that would be cool. We rent our downstairs out for Airbnb and sometimes our guests decide to download some serious files or something and hog the bandwidth. My only options are to let them use the guest network or cut them off. Anyways, those are just wish list items and don't reflect my 3 stars. The 3 star rating is b/c this isn't nearly as stable as I was hoping. I will keep this simply bc they are too expensive to toss, and the mesh is nice. I put one unit way out in my shop, and now it's nice to get wifi out there when I'm dinking around out there."}

{"Author": "Jeremy Verhines", "Date": "on May 29, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Google WIFI, The Real Deal", "Text": "Just thought I\u2019d share some info. I know most if not all of us always hate those dead spots in the house with regards to internet and WiFi connectivity. I purchased up my service with a higher speed (500Mgbs) because I have up to 15 devices running at any given time. Gaming, 6 Smart TVs, 6 IPhones, 3 Mac Computers, 2 Alexa\u2019s, my Security System, etc. It adds up fast.\n\nI had cox out to my house this past weekend and asked him how I can get more connectivity in places where the signal is weak. I told him I purchased a faster speed and it is still too slow. The rep told me it has nothing to do with speed as much as it has to do with the signal and connectivity. He said you can have 1G of speed but still be slow if your connection is weak throughout the house. The key is getting a strong signal everywhere so that speed is not compromised when weaker areas are attempting access in whatever capacity/form ie Iphone, Netflix, gaming etc.\n\nThe cox rep told me that standard extenders do not do the trick. You know, the 10-20 dollar jobbers that plug into an outlet and look like a little cheap box. He also said the standard extenders are garbage because in order to benefit, they need to have a strong signal to them to begin with then the user has to manually connect to it time and time again. If the user is in their room on their iPhone and they leave, go down stairs then they lose the connection to the extender, have to reconnect to the main WiFi router and so goes the story. That is why extenders are cheap. They rarely serve their purpose. Trust me, I have tried this route in the recent pass. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.\n\nSo, on to the solution that I am so so so stoked on. Totally worth the money, totally worth the investment. This is a real live, real life, real deal review of product I chose and it\u2019s validity.\n\nMy cox rep told me to look into replacing my current modem/WiFi router with a 2 part solution.\n\nCurrently, I have a cable/WiFi combo. I decided to take my cox reps advice and purchased specific technology with the best most up to date technology.\n\nPart 1:\nI purchased a stand alone cable modem. I chose the Next Generation Arris SurfBOARD SB8200 with 3.1 DOCSIS technology. Before the purchase it is extremely important to make sure your cable provider supports the modem technology. It will say in the description what providers support it. If unsure, call your provider first. A lot of times the providers update what they support but don\u2019t let the manufacturers know. Very important step.\n\nPart 2:\nOnce you remove cable provider modem/WiFi combo, install new modem. Plug it in and attach the cable coax only. Call your cable provider and tell them you installed a new cable modem and need them to update their end and establish the connection. This does not take long. After that you are done and ready for part 3.\n\nPart 3:\nFor the WiFi part (because I got rid of combo modem and went back to a 2 part solution) I purchased Googles WiFi System, the 3 pack because of my square footage.\n\nFirst, download Googles WiFi app. Sign in with your google account and follow the onscreen setup tutorial. Google makes it fast and easy.\n\nSecond, unpack and plug in power of your first Google WiFi router and connect it to your chosen stand alone cable modem via ethernet cable. Once that is done, the app on your phone will have you scan the primary Google WiFi router. Once you scan it, you name it Family room, living room etc). This way you know it\u2019s your primary point. Then google takes you through naming your WiFi network, setting up the password etc. Super easy!\n\nOnce you set up your primary, it is connected, the tutorial tells you to set up your second location. I bought the 3 pack so I had 3 total to set up. I took my second WiFi router and put it in my master bedroom as this is a familiar dead spot and is a location that was a great perimeter point of reference to create a triangle line effect with regards to covering the entire house. Once you plug it in the wall, the Google app goes to work, connects the second location, allows you to name it and extends the entire primary signal to this second location. And I mean ENTIRE 5 bar signal strength.\n\nFinally, I took my third Google WiFi router device up stairs to the great room which is the furthest most point from the primary point. The google app finished the connection and synced them all together creating this triangle like coverage effect. Yes, the end point gives me 5 bars. Full signal.\n\nThe Result:\nSo, just to see how strong the signal was, I ran a test from the google app, then from my son\u2019s Xbox and finally from my cox at home app just so I had an unbiased result with real congruence. Well, the result, full 5 bar strength with over 399Mgbs down load speed and over 60Mgbs upload. This was with multiple devices connected and probably 10 running and from the farthest distant part of the home. Now, I am finally benefiting from the speed I purchase, don\u2019t have to reconnect to different extenders and DON\u2019T need my entire house rewired for data access.\n\nThe cost: roughly 400 bucks. (I\u2019ll save 120 year from the modem rental and after 3.5 years essentially have my investment paid off).\n\nPS. Also purchased these cool brackets that the Google WiFi access points clip into and plug into the wall. No chords or cables showing. Very clean for those minimalist types."}

This was a remarkably good experience to setup. Arguably the best home networking experience I have ever had.\n\nI took a star off because there is one feature of DHCP that this product doesn't support.\nIt doesn't allow you setup a default search domain (it defaults to \"lan\") but doesn't give you the option to change that in anyway.\n\nIf you have a home lab setup in a similar that mine is then this product great but not perfect.\n\nHere is the physical layout of my home network:\nInternet -> ISP Modem -> Dual Nic - ClearOS Firewall Server (DHCP, DNS, Directory services, etc...) -> Switch (to service my LAN) -> Google Wifi (connected to the switch to provide WIFI access to my LAN).\n\nIf you have a configuration where Google Wifi is using your local LAN as its \"internet provider\" then you can just use your normal LAN's DNS services to resolve names. To do this you simply set the DNS server on the Google Wifi to use the \"ISP DNS\".\n\nWhen you do this you can resolve DNS on your LAN if you use FQDNs like \"somehost.localcomain\". Every thing works great except for one very minor annoyance.\n\nThe DHCP server that runs on Google WIFI doesn't have the standard options that a \"real\" DHCP server has, namely providing a default search domain for DHCP clients. It does set one to \"lan\" but doesn't give you the option to change it to your own local domain.\n\nI realize I'm very much an edge case: I'm may change my local domain to \"lan\" just to avoid the annoyance of entering FQDNs from mobile devices on my network but for now I'll use it \"as is\" and just leave this review (hopefully someone at google sees this and considers the functionality).\n\nIf the option to provide a \"default search domain\" was in the DHCP settings this would be a 5 start product IMO.\n\nAlso a bigger ask that may not be physically possible would be to allow the use of these as a bridge to my existing LAN in \"mesh mode\". It currently works in stand-alone (non-mesh) mode as a bridge but not meshed."}

When I moved in I had some renovations done, including running an ethernet cable from the point where my FiOS came into the house in a rocky crawl space area up to my home office on the second floor. From there I ran a WiFi router to service my home. The router was on the top left side of the house, and the kitchen is in the middle of the house. So WiFi was spotty at some areas of the house, with service dropping and not allowing me to Netflix and Chill (tm). This was bad since I have 100Mbit FioS service and couldn't take advantage of it.\n\nI purchased a single Google WiFi device, doubtful it could help my situation. I placed it in the location of the original WiFi router, and shut off the other one to minimize interference. Sure enough, I was right. Coverage was worse than before. All of my devices were connecting at 2.4Ghz. Throwing caution to the wind, I ordered a second one, and located it on the opposite side of the house on the same floor.\n\nTo my surprise, that worked fabulously! My whole house is bathed in WiFi. I'd highly recommend this device. It doesn't have all of the advanced settings as regular WiFi routers, but it gave me wicked fast times and simplicity in setting it up. Also nice they all get the same SSID across devices, and it's also the same SSID for 2.4 and 5Ghz. 'One SSID to rule them all'. Your device and the wifi system pick the best way to connect. Makes life simpler."}

My previous wifi - which included being broadcast from the modem through the built in wifi PLUS a wifi router that is supposedly for large houses that I was using to extend the reach, did not reach the garage. It also didn't reach the driveway, so if I was out there and wanted to look up directions or some other thing before leaving, I couldn't. Oh, there is also barely any cell service here so I depend on wifi to make my phone work.\n\nWe just got upgraded from 15mbps to 100mbps! But, the wifi from the standalone router would top out at 20, I think because it was set to work as an extender. I was looking at all the options and saw some beastly routers that supposedly had good coverage, but they seemed to have the same range as the one I already have that wasn't far enough. Then I saw these things and it looked like it was just what I needed.\n\nThey were very easy to set up and I now have 100mbps internet in the house, garage, driveway, and backyard. I haven't fully tested the range, but if you look at my pictures, I get a strong signal 120ft into the backyard (I stopped at the edge of the fence, range would go beyond that). 120ft from the house in the driveway, it comes up as weak. I'm not sure why that would be, but it reaches just fine to where we park, and to the garage. In the pictures I marked the device locations and they are all along outer walls of the house. It is a manufactured home so the walls likely have less interference than a regular house.\n\nNow Netflix loads the browsing menu, where before you had to sit and wait for it to load the thumbnail of each show/movie, or sometimes it would just give up and show a bunch of grey rectangles instead of the pictures."}

It would not work even though the secondary point was less than 30 ft away from the primary point. I tried numerous positions. Finally I had to \"trick\" it. I setup the secondary point in a position where it could physically see the primary one (4 feet away), then I moved it to another part of the house where there was an Ethernet data point setup and plugged it in there. Now I have full WiFi coverage in the house.\n\nPros:\n- The mesh network (when it is setup) is nice. No need to jump on different WiFi network using a range extender\n- It is actually pretty fast\n- The ability to setup a Guest network and parental controls\n- The app provides useful info like speed tests\n\nCons:\n- The mesh network only pairs when the units can see each other (like mere feet away) unless you have data points setup in your home.\n\nSummary:\n- Great if you have a small-medium home and it doesn't have tons of steel in it\n- Great if you have data points already setup in your home\n- Not great if your home is medium-large and has no data points.

Finally after reading countless reviews for Google WiFi I decided it was time to make the switch and OMG, I can't believe how great things are working now. WiFi is always working, every devices is connected without any issues/problems.

{"Author": "Senhal", "Date": "on May 15, 2018", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Good Performance, Frustrating Setup", "Text": "We just installed a set of 3 Google Wifi access points in our apartment. Our previous router had a difficult time blanketing our living space with a good signal. However, the setup and installation process was frustrating -- although now the mesh network is working well. For the record I served as a one-man IT department for a small nonprofit for a short time, so I have some experience with networking hardware and mesh systems.\n\nIN BRIEF\n\n+ devices are attractive and work well (once set up)\n+ the Google Wifi app does facilitate certain tasks\n+ it was relatively simple to add another user as a network manager\n+ wireless speeds are better and more consistent than with our old router\n+ any of the access points can be used to connect a wired device via a LAN port\n+ you can still use a networking switch downstream from access points\n+ guest Wifi setup is straightforward\n\n- you need to have a Gmail account to set up and manage your network\n- setup can be difficult if you wish to use any of the advanced options (see below)\n- you can't force a firmware update to the access points, which might be necessary for advanced networking options (IP address, DHCP, DNS, etc.)\n- app error messages are not verbose or helpful, and troubleshooting options are limited\n- each access point only has one LAN port (also no USB connectivity, which admittedly is rare)\n- only manageable via an app (and a device that can run it)\n- still lacks some advanced customization options, though future updates might address this\n\nIN DETAIL\n\nBecause a couple devices on our home LAN have static IP addresses (including an Amahi home server), I wanted to minimize frustrations by simply changing the default IP address of the Google Wifi LAN (192.168.86.xx) to my previous setup (192.168.10.xx). The app gave me the option to do this (once I was through the initial access point setup -- I wish it were baked into the auto configuration, as it would simply things), but the changes I tried to make in-app wouldn't stick. The app claimed the changes could not be saved (\"Oops something happened. We can't save the changes right now\"). Some advanced setup fields, like the DHCP address pool, couldn't be edited at all. After doing a little reading online I determined that my Wifi devices shipped with an older firmware -- one that didn't yet support this advanced functionality (which apparently began with v. 9901.53.2). The app even told me that the device software was out of date; however, it gave me no option to force the firmware to update. So I was at a loss. I read that forcing the device to reboot via the app might help push the update, so I tried that and left it alone for about 20 minutes, after which point it actually updated and I was able to make the DHCP changes in the advanced settings panel. But letting you update the firmware yourself and notifying you when the device was updating itself (and power-cycling) would be helpful features.\n\nSo that was one frustration. We experienced a number of other small hiccups. I used my iPhone 7 (iOS 11.3.1) to set up the network, but once we established the mesh wireless network with the same SSID/password of my previous (now uninstalled) network, my phone wouldn't join it, even though my wife's joined it instantaneously. In fact her phone immediately received an option from the network to share the password with my device (an interesting feature), which seemed pointless because our devices were using the same (i.e. the previous) network credentials. Eventually I forced my phone to forget the network and rejoined it fresh, but it still wouldn't authorize. In the end it took 15 minutes to authorize after I rebooted my phone, but then it was fine. So if this happens to you, try giving it time.\n\nAdditionally, when we first attempted to add the second access point in an adjacent room, the app failed and told me that the point was too far away. So I moved it adjacent to the main point and still received the same error. I then restarted the iOS application and tried it one more time and finally the access point was added successfully. (I then moved it back into the adjacent room without any issue.) The third point (2 rooms away from the second one) gave us fewer problems.\n\nWe're enjoying the mesh network now that it's up and running, but I still have reservations about such a streamlined setup. If anything goes off the rails, you don't have many options within the app to troubleshoot anything. The best you can do is reboot, cross your fingers, and try again."}

The thing that really makes this system great is the phone app. It guides you through setup nicely (DO follow the advice of others and setup the satellites close to the main unit initially, THEN figure out their final location).\n\nThe phone app lets you test the signal strength at each unit individually. It also gives you lots of fun information about your network, whether you're home on the network or not. You can test your internet speed, see the satellite units(which you can label Kitchen, Master Bedroom, etc.) and test their connection strength. You can also pull up all the connected devices and even see which satellite they're connected to. So I can see who's at home based on whether or not their phone is connected and even know which part of the house they're in. I know, kind of stalkerish, but also useful and fun!\n\nThough the fun stuff is easily accessible, one doesn't have to have any network knowledge otherwise: Google wifi automatically optimizes the connections and bands for you.

Right now you can \"pause\" a device cutting its internet off, or you can prioritize a device that needs the best internet.\nThe google Wifi also manages all DHCP ip reservations. It would be nice if I could have a router before the Google system, handling all the DHCP since other routers allow much better customization, and then just let the Google routers do the mesh network. But that's not possible.\nGreat that any Google hub can be plugged into ethernet, which means it will get its internet from ethernet instead of wirelessly from another hub, in the case your rooms are already wired for ethernet. Keep in mind, the ethernet has to originate from the primary hub, it can't come from a different network."}

I have struggled for years to get good wifi coverage. I've got by, by using a second more powerful router/access point and mains power line adaptors for TV and my outside office. The Google wifi installation has revolutionized this.\n\nI bought a double pack and a single pack. Installation was astonishingly easy. Basically, the instructions read: 1. Plug it in 2. Scan the QR code. That really is all you have to do. There is an app which helps you position the Points for best Mesh coverage.\n\nTo my amazement, just one Point provided coverage across the whole house. However, one point on its own is not a Mesh network and there were some corners with one bar of signal strength so I installed the second Google Point. This has provided full signal strength everywhere including bedrooms, garage, outside office and even the garden. I've also connected the TV, Apple TV, PC and printer into the wireless mesh network, chucking out all the PowerPoint connectors, cables and wifi booster. In order to make for a nice clean look with the google wifi, I order the Basstop Wall Mount Bracket Holder also.\n\nI agonized over whether to install or return the third Google Point. It really wasn't required but, just for the fun of it, I installed it in a bedroom anyway. I've been running this network for about two months. My fiber-to-cab speed at every point in the house is now only limited by my provider\u2019s connection.\n\nI could not ask for more, I can't believe how I struggled my whole life without it..."}

I am beyond disappointed.\n\nI have a 1 gbps Internet connection. I purchased Google\u2019s mesh system just because I like google and the features advertised with the system. My current router worked well and I live in a small, 1500 sq foot house and decided to get the Google system to try it out.\n\nI setup the system and conduct a Speedtest and get 60 mbps. I think that there must be some mistake. I go over the whole process again, but I get the same results. I troubleshoot the issue and run a diagnostic through Google\u2019s app, but according to the App... everything is \u201cGreat\u201d. At this point, I start to think something has to be wrong with the modem and I plug in a ethernet cable to test the speed direct from the modem and I get 970 mbps. Now I know 100% there is an issue with Google\u2019s system.\n\nNow, my last option is to call Google\u2019s customer support. I call them and I do the usual troubleshooting steps you would expect, all of which I already did on my own. When we get to the point that the only conclusion is that the Google system is faulty, the Google tech support starts to make me do things like move the WiFi points closer together or make sure there was a clear line of sight. I live in a 1500 square foot home and this is a mesh system that is supposed to cover 3 times that! Just using one WiFi point should have been adequate. After we ruled out that it wasn\u2019t the proximity of the points, the tech started to say it could be the environment. Then I plugged in the router provided by my service provider and immediately was getting above 800 mbps. Apparently, only the google WiFi system had issues with the environment.\n\nI figured I had a rare defective system. After reading some blogs and forums, now I realize this is not a rare occurrence. Many people have this same issue and Google apparently has trained their technicians to blame it on anything except their product. I love google products... this was a very disappointing experience.\n\nPlease, don\u2019t waste your time or money on this product."}

I've tried the access point route and not had tremendous luck.\n\nI chose the Google Wifi because it seemed very easy to setup and use based on reviews on Amazon and YouTube. I have never owned Google branded anything, but I expected a high quality product.\n\nThe Google units are fairly stylish, but more importantly very easy to setup using the Google Wifi App. The App will assist you (sort of) in placing them throughout your house to gain even wifi coverage and the units have pretty powerful radios. The App itself has some cool features - you can see all your connected devices, you can see what wifi unit they are attached to, and the download rate at each unit.\n\nOverall speeds degrade the further you are from the base unit, but without having actual wired networking options, there's no way around that.

Full WiFi coverage in my (smallish) house with just the 1-Pack.", "Text": "So this replaced a 10 year old Apple router and has brought my home into the modern age. The range on this thing is phenomenal to what I used to have. I just have the one on my middle floor and covers my entire 3-floor townhouse in full, glorious WiFi. I can stream HD video to Apple TVs (4th-gen, non-4k) with no problem. The ability to check my home's internet speed came in very handy when I needed to troubleshoot the Internet with Comcast remotely -- also the ability to see all devices connected to the router AND be able to pause the kids' wifi is super great.\n\nMy only teeny hangup is that there is only the one ethernet port -- other WiFi routers have multiple ports for multiple devices so you'll need to get something like a TP-Link 5 Port switch to connected more wired devices. But the tradeoff is that you get a very compact device with this, which I love - and space is a precious commodity in my home so having something compact like this is perfect. Highly recommend."}

{"Author": "Barbara Nevarez", "Date": "on April 30, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Jeepers", "Text": "I recently bought a Linksys Ac2200 that pumped out roughly 70mb of wifi and 180mb with Ethernet. It also didn't provide coverage to the basement or upper floors. I replaced that with a night hawk that shot out 135mb with Wi-Fi and 210 with Ethernet. The night hawk did provide wifi to the upper floors but still struggled with the concrete enclosed basement.\n\nThe google wifi consistently hurls 200mb+ wifi speeds and 280mb+ with Ethernet. The range is everywhere thanks to the three small routers that automatically juggle you to provide the best connection.\n\nThe routers don't really have any changeable settings. If you like to customize your router then this probably won't be your cup of tea. This is a simple plug and play without having to worry."}

When an Android smartphone, or an Ipad, is heavily uploading (mainly Google Photos autobackup and YouTube), the download rate freezes for all devices, and Google WiFi can do nothing about this. I switched my cable internet provider router to bridge mode, but it didn't work. Could try giving priority to all other devices, but it's an odd and time consuming solution...\n\nPros:\n- easy setup (however with no advanced user mode)\n- strong signal\n\nCons:\n- it's not able to balance the bandwidth among devices\n- settings section is very poor - you can't set up download or upload limit per device, as several cheaper routers permit\n- sometimes you can't connect to WiFi when Internet connection is offline\n- provides some network usage stats (real time, 1d, 7d, 30d, 60d), but nothing can be configured\n\nBeside some issues with Google Photos App (you can't set the upload limit speed; you can't choose the backup hours), I'm not satisfied with Google Wifi system because it doesn't solve the issues I had with the older router."}

My house is only 1700 square feet, single storey, but I have over 50 devices on the network, 10 of which are cameras (a hobby, not paranoia) and we also want enough bandwidth to a detached garage on the other side of the patio to watch 1080p security cameras with sound. I had an Archer router and two extenders, which worked fine in the house, but wifi in the garage was poor, and extenders are a different network, which made sharing a printer with my husband's Man Cave a pain. I set up one GW point high on the wall perpendicular to and closest to the garage, another in the living room, and the third in the hallway outside the Man Cave, effectively bypassing the furnace room and washer/dryer wiring that had always made that room wifi-unfriendly. Everything works very well indoors, and the garage is good so far; we'll wait and see for that because it's really a lot to ask of wifi. If the garage signal still isn't strong enough, I'll get another GW point and hardwire it. GW is quite expensive, sure, but not having to switch connections to get the best reception, depending upon whether I'm inside, in the garage, or somewhere in the yard makes me happy. Setup was very simple, and had I just used DHCP for everything, I'd have had it all sorted in an hour, but the cameras and my ZoneMinder server need static IPs, and I have a bunch of TCP and RTSP ports that have to be forwarded, so it's taken a lot longer. Speed is excellent, and while I do not particularly like our ISP, our connection is pretty fast and stable, so I don't anticipate problems. I *really* wish GW had a web interface, though, because it's a pain to type with one finger on a phone or tablet when I could be touch-typing with both hands on a keyboard."}

Sadly, after months of real world application and use, I have to warn people from buying into the hype. Its now notoriously known for not being able to maintain fast WiFi connections. I've got gigabit internet service going to my house, and although I don't expect WiFi to realistically hit gigabit speeds, I do at least expect around 600-700Mbps. Unfortunately, Google WiFi only delivers about 3% of what my internet speed is capable of. Consistently, my average transfer speed through WiFi is around 30 - 45Mbps. This is unacceptable. I've gone through troubleshooting numerous times with Google's support to no avail. Once in a while, it will hit the proper speeds, by proper I mean anything above 100Mbps, but that lasts only a few minutes. I am absolutely disappointed in this product. Buyers be warned."}

{"Author": "Unboxtasy", "Date": "on April 17, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "One of the best routers on the market!", "Text": "Words cannot describe how much we love our Google Wifi System that we purchased during Cyber Monday last year for a set of 3 for around $200. We originally had an Apple Extreme (third generation), but due to overheating issues from the Apple's fan, we had to replace it even though we simply love Apple products, the Extreme is a POS. It took us several days to do our research and look online for a system that was versatile and easy to use and had our eye on this particular system for a while, but didn't want to make the purchase because of the high investment costs. We were quite happy when it came on sale during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday week.\n\nInstallation was a breeze (surprisingly). Simply add the first dot near your modem and install the Google Wifi App on your phone. The app will walkthrough the installation process. To install the other dots, all you have to do is place the dot ANYWHERE you want and the system will automatically pick the second or third dot up and it takes a few seconds for the App to identify the additional dots. Unlike the Apple Extreme, the App provides comprehensive information on what devices are currently being connected to the wifi network. A great way to see who is on your network and how to remove devices that you aren't really sure should be on your network. Google went one step-up by providing remote access to your wifi network. A great tool for anyone going on vacation or traveling for work to track your wifi network at home. Perfect for anyone who has multiple devices or any smart home devices that you need to monitor (security system, pet feeder, Nest Cam).\n\nEach single \"dot\" covered about 1,500 square feet with all three covering about 4,00 square feet (about the size of a large home with 3-5 bedrooms). One dot can cover an apartment complex without any issue. The only negative is that the Google Wifi system had difficulty pushing signals through walls, hence the need for multiple dots throughout each room. We didn't have this particular issue with the Apple Extreme as it had no problem pushing wifi signals through different types of walls.\n\nOur rating scale\nDesign: 5/5\nUtility: 5/5\nEffectiveness: 5/5\nNoticeable flaws: The only flaws is the inability of the mesh network to push the wifi signal through walls as effective as other routers. Secondly, some people had issues with the LED light that is emitted from the device itself (but we enjoyed the light but wanted to put it here in case you do not).\n\nOur answers to the frequently asked questions:\n\nWhat data does Google collect from this router?\n\nThis is what we found from Google: \"The information your Wifi points and the Google Wifi app collect helps us deliver the best Wi-Fi experience possible. Importantly, the Google Wifi app and your Wifi points do not track the websites you visit or collect the content of any traffic on your network. However, your Wifi points does collect data such as Wi-Fi channel, signal strength, and device types that are relevant to optimize your Wi-Fi performance. Google policies and terms of services apply as normal to any Google services you use (like Gmail or Google search), whether you\u2019re using them on an Google Wifi network or not.\"\n\nCan I set up a guest network that is isolated from my main home network?\n\nYes, you can setup additional networks that is isolated from your main network with the different dots.\n\nCan i link up one google wifi router with a google onhub router to create a mesh network?\n\nYes, they are linkable together.\n\nOverall, it is a simple, easy to use, and versatile mesh wifi system that can be used by anyone. We recommend purchasing the three dot system as it is more cost effective than purchasing one. The ability to track your network on the go is a great tool for anyone who has a smart home device system.\n\nLike our review? Hit the \"Yes\" button below for it being useful.

It seems like a steep price, but it worth every penny. I have probably spent this much on all the other worthless extenders I've tried over the years. I do work in the IT industry, but it is not necessary when it comes to the simple setup Google has for this system. It literally took me 10 minutes from start to finish...I did it on my lunch break. I literally took the first Google access point out of the box and plugged it into the modem and power source and poof it connected to the app without any issues at all. Then the other two access points were easy...the app walks you through the setup and in a matter of minutes you have a mesh network setup and ready to go. The best part of all is to see the network speeds you get after setting up this system. I even get over 100 mbps in my backyard now! I don't regret this purchase and I bet you won't either.

I spent hours on the phone with both Google Fiber (my ISP) and Google WiFi support, performed an ungodly number of tests, only to realize nothing would resolve this.

If you have kids, you can put them into Family tags, allowing schedules which can be automatic or manually paused on a device-by-device level, or as a group.

The worst offense however was that my Google Pixel phone would hang at times, so much so that I began skipping even turning on my phone's Wifi at home due to the inconvenience.\n\nThat became a problem even more so when leveraging things like video chat, WiFi Calling and the uploading photos / videos to social media. Finally I reached a point a few weeks ago that I just couldn't ignore it anymore.\n\nThe Google WiFi is everything I didn't know I needed. It looks better than most things sitting on my computer desk (and in my home really), and the WiFi signal even without external antennas goes farther than my previous Linksys router ever did in my three story house.\n\nAfter a quick setup via mobile app, I was off and running and have been for a few weeks now with ZERO issues on the Google WiFi.

Setup is done all in the app downloaded onto a smartphone or tablet, making it one of the easier setups. If your looking for true plug and play this is the router for you. I went from a Linksys ea6900 router and it is a remarkable improvement in stability. With my old router I was having to reboot it at least once a week to reconnect everything to the internet. With the google routers I haven't had to do that a single time yet. So stability is a definite improvement. You can monitor your network with the app on your smartphone or tablet as an added bonus. You can restart the network, dim the lights on the routers, even setup port forwarding and static IPs should you feel the need.\n\nThe coverage are for three routers is about right. I have around 2100 sq feet split between upstairs and downstairs, and positioned the routers around the house. On one side of the house I put the main router right against the wall on the far side of the house due to where the internet enters my home. The second one is in a bedroom about 65 feet away through one wall, and the last is downstairs right below the main router. I have seen a substantial improvement in not only WIFI coverage, but speed as well. I pay for 100MBs and was only getting around half that in the first bedroom, and spotty coverage at best in the far end of the house. downstairs in the basement was spotty at best, and it was right below the main router I had before. Now, I have tested the internet speed throughout my home and have seen we consistently get our full download speed within about 10MBs.\n\nParental controls are included in the settings of the app as well. All you need to do is setup each device, and give it a name like kids or whatever. From that point on you can set a schedule to turn off the internet during set times. You can also pause the internet whenever needed from the app for homework time or whatever you need it for(punishment). I would most certainly recommend this mesh router for anyone needing the coverage, even as just a single router."}

{"Author": "E. Austin", "Date": "on April 1, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "The best Mesh WiFi out there! Goodbye single-access point routers!", "Text": "I am a ITS Help Desk Manager and avid Smart Home enthusiast. I used to run very powerful, top-of-the-line Netgear Routers because my home is wrapped in steel siding. This was always a problem with WiFi in my home - especially getting any useful signal out in the yard.\n\nEnter Google WiFi. I bought my first 3-pack of pucks; placing one in the basement where the Google Fiber Router was, one nearly above it on the ground floor, and then another about 25 feet away in the kitchen on the ground floor. Coverage went up dramatically.\n\nThese are super simple install and some other reviews here go into great detail on installation so I won't continue to echo them. Get the app on your phone, plug in your first one to your router and power, scan the puck, and you're off to a great start.\n\nMy first experience with the original 3-puck set was very pleasing. However, my kitchen puck sometimes would report only \"OK\" signal instead of \"Great\" all the time. I also have a need to connect a couple devices on the other side of the basement, and to top off my wish list: stream any content deep in my back yard.\n\nEnter the second 3-puck pack!\n\nHere I will answer some of the lesser-known experiences and the off-the-beaten-path questions and give you my take on expanding Google WiFi as well as expanding into some areas that most folks may not.\n\nI did my homework in finding out how many pucks you can add to your Google WiFi mesh and found a few people reporting problems once they hit about 8. I've not come across any real answers why this happens, but it's out there. So adding another 3-pack went smoothly, and I now have another on the ground floor in the living room, another in the basement, which in turn allowed me to make the jump out to the shed in the back yard.\n\nAs of this writing, there is no official technical specifications for operating temperatures, but I did find an answer online that the Google WiFi shares much of the same technology as the OnHub, so operational temperatures should be similar: 0-40 degrees C (32-104 F) and 0-90% humidity.\n\nSo obviously, these are NOT waterproof, and prefer some sort of sheltered/protected environment. Simply putting one in an open shed would NOT protect it from high humidity, nor freezing temps and sweltering heat. I put mine in a sealed electrical enclosure large enough to protect the puck and its cord/plug. I mounted the enclosure on the outside of my shed. While freezing temps are not necessarily as bad as say 110 degree heat, I still power off my outdoor puck when it drops below 30F (leaving it off till temps rise above 40F to prevent condensation from forming from warming up the electronics while frozen) and also if it gets above 105, I power off the outdoor puck if not being used.\n\nHere is my experience with my now 6-puck setup:\n\nOverall, the app reports all pucks always maxing out on the mesh test (the test that lets you know how well connected each puck is to another), even the outdoor puck and basement pucks. Every device connected to the WiFi mesh indoors (and there are 35+ as of this writing) reports full bars no matter where I am in the house. When outside (remember the steel siding?), I get full bars within 30 feet of the house, then drops to no less than half bars all the way to the street and even across the street into my neighbors yards. The exception is the backyard where the puck on the shed sends half bars some 120+ ft away. My phone will connect to my Google WiFi point from around the corner when I am driving home. That's nearly 350 feet away!\n\nThe outdoor puck is proving itself extremely useful in I can now use my Smart Home products securely on my own network as I make the last corner driving up to my house - think unlocking the back door, etc. - as well as being able to use the newest WiFi security cameras on virtually any point of my property where I can put an electrical outlet. (I have an extensive set of Arlo Cameras for many spots outside, but they have to be relatively close to the house because they connect to their own proprietary WiFi and are not able to connect to any other WiFi - read the Arlo reviews on this) Plus the thought of now having a Google Mini and an Echo Dot in the back yard makes me happy.\n\nI may try to add a 7th puck sometime in the future if I find I really need it and will update this review if/when that happens. For now, I am more than overjoyed with the coverage.\n\nOther useful features that I love:\n\nBeing able to remotely and securely administrate my network including \"pausing\" individual devices connected to the network.\nBeing able to remotely see if my network at home is up and who is using how much bandwidth in real time.\nSetting up an IFTTT (yes it does IFTTT!) to tell me when my girlfriend gets home when her smartphone connects to my network. (Can be also used to automate some other things too!)\nI love now having two ethernet ports on each puck that allows me to hardwire devices if I want or have to (handy for those Smart TVs that get stubborn with keeping a WiFi connection).\nIt updates itself automatically so it's always up to date for security patches, performance, etc."}

They have a privacy policy lists what kinds of data they do and do not collect, but they also reserve the right to change their privacy policy at any time (which tech companies like to do).

The wireless router was 2.4ghz only and covered all 3 levels (~1,500 sq ft per level) with a decent enough signal. Having an open stairwell near the router helped. The speed on all of my simple devices was fine. By simple I mean thermostats, garage door opener, Echos, Sonos, smart lights and irrigation system. Performance to computing devices absolutely sucked (MacBooks, iPhones, AppleTV or iPads). So, i dragged out an old dual band router, cascaded it to the pathetic AT&T combo and started receiving 45mbs performance on all of my computing devices. However the 5ghz signal left 2 or 3 dead-spots in the far corners of my 3 story townhome.\n\nI decided to get the Google WiFi 3-pack and place one on each floor. Set up was absolutely easy. Within 15 minutes I had all 3 WiFi points installed and serving 45mbs+ to any device connected to the new network and no dead-spots. My only problem was connecting my 3 Sonos CONNECT:AMPs to Google WiFi. I don\u2019t know whether to blame Google or Sonos, but it was a 3 hour exercise to get them to work. You see, Sonos doesn\u2019t adapt easily to a new wireless network and only uses the 2.4ghz channel. I had to connect the Sonos gear to Google WiFi because they (Sonos) requires that the controlling devices (iPads, iPhones, etc.) be on the same network as the Sonos gear.\n\nThe only reason this isn\u2019t a 5 Star review is that the Google WiFi devices are larger than I like and have to be in an open area to form a solid mesh. If I were handy enough, I would mount them on the ceiling of 2 of the 3 floors. But running power to each location is slightly above my skill set."}

Your 2.4 GHz device will latch onto the 2.4/5GHz SSID and the router will be talking 5 GHz and your device will be talking 2.4GHz and you will not be able to communicate with your device again until it is either hard reset or hard connected via Ethernet. I thought the proposed solution given to tech support to pass onto me was a joke. Either physically take your device outside the 5 GHz range but still inside the 2.4GHz range (you have to figure out where this is) and try to hook it up that way, or fake (reconfigure) your current router into looking like the Google Wi-Fi router, link your device to the bastardized old router at 2.4GHz and hope the google router can be swapped in and will remain on the 2.4 GHz channel. Unbelievable kludge for such a respected technology company. There are still many 2.4GHz-only devices being sold that will not work with this router - buyer beware."}

{"Author": "Chris T Ellis", "Date": "on March 26, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "It. Just. Works.", "Text": "Over the years, I've used several different routers for home wifi, and most recently a rented modem/router gateway system from our service provider. Once I determined enough was enough with the monthly rental fee, it was time to determine if I wanted a combo unit or to go back to a separate modem and router. Ultimately, the separate devices won out, given that I could replace or upgrade one or the other over time as needed.\n\nI almost went back to a traditional router, but was intrigued by the mesh network idea, something that wasn't mainstream the last time I made a purchasing decision. The overwhelmingly positive reviews--here and elsewhere--of the Google system made me willing to take a risk, and I'm glad I did.\n\nThus far, the network has performed flawlessly--notwithstanding hiccups with my provider in provisioning the modem. (So it goes.) All of the comments about easy setup from the app are spot on. It was intuitive and simple to set up my primary unit, and the app guided me through connecting the next two. Performing a network test was as easy as clicking on the screen to verify my placements worked.\n\nI spread the units out two rooms apart across one floor, whereas with my previous setup, the gateway was more or less where my \"main\" Google unit was, with a range extended where the furthest Google pod sits. The range extender setup was tolerable, but did not deliver great speeds, whereas with Google Wifi, I'm getting fantastic speeds, at the top of my service tier, consistently throughout the house.\n\nMy setup was complete in under 30 minutes, and part of that time was considering which outlets I wanted to use, not actually setting up the devices.\n\nI do like being able to easily label devices, and the parental control/safe search feature for kids' devices (and the ability to pause, though I haven't tried that yet) from the app are welcome features. I also am appreciative that you can have more than one manager on the family account.\n\nFurther, the ability to set a priority device is a nice touch. I used that while streaming a show on an Amazon Fire TV device, to ensure minimal buffering (and it worked, so far as I can surmise).\n\nYes, the cost is higher than a traditional router, even a higher-end router. But not needing to switch manually between the two 2.4 and 5 gig networks is already a plus in my book, and the simplicity and quality are hard to argue with. I don't recall any modem or router ever being this easy to set up.\n\nA big thanks to Google for making home Wifi as simple as it should be,"}

It took me all of maybe 20 minutes total to set it up and have it operational. I purchased a three-unit system for WiFi in a modest sized 3 bedroom home that includes an in-law apartment over the garage. I set the master unit in the center of the house, and put one unit in the in-law apartment and one unit on the other side of the house. There's not a single spot in the house where we can't pick up WiFi, including the basement, the garage, driveway, and back patio.\n\nI've seen reviews where people complain that you have to have internet service before you can set up the product. Truthfully, I'm not sure why that is a complaint...seems that the reason to purchase this product is to set up WiFi access to your internet service. I purchased the Google system to replace an outdated WiFi router already in the house. After reading a lot of reviews on different units, I decided to go the extra dollars for the mesh system. Although I like the technical back-end setting up a router, I chose the simpler Google system set-up over that because I'm the only geek in the house anyway. What most people really want in a wireless set-up is to be able to sign on and just use their device with a strong, reliable signal.\n\nSetup involves connecting one unit to your ISP modem (ethernet cable provided) and opening the phone app, which will seek the unit using bluetooth. Once the unit is located and acquired, the app prompts you to install the next unit if you are installing more than one. Continue this way until all units are installed and acquired. That's it. Nothing more to it.\n\nGoogle WiFi mesh totally rocks it for signal strength and what so far has proven to be rock-solid reliability. Simple set up, simple sign-on, simple use of a phone app to manage the system (which, by the way, I can access even if my ISP drops out). The app allows set-up of a guest network as well (which is nice for visitors who need internet access occasionally, but that you don't necessarily want having access to your home network).\n\nAt last count, mine is a household with 17 devices, between smart TVs, smart phones, PCs and Macs, wireless printers, and other electronic devices. There's plenty of signal strength for all of it."}

Setup is via a Google app that you download from the App Store, but you only get the link for the app after you buy the system. Each hub is controlled via a Bluetooth Link, which adds a physical layer of security if you're worried about a Russian hacker reprogramming your hub via the Internet. Bluetooth itself is a short-range standard, with a range of only about 36 ft (12m) or so, which means you have to be in or near the premises in order to access the hubs to reprogram them.\n\nOne hub does need to plug into your cable modem in order to connect with the outside world. The other two can be placed anywhere you want as long as you have AC mains available. They're small and light and can be placed almost anywhere. I have two on bookcases and one discretely placed on a window sill. I recommend reading the instructions a couple of times before setup to avoid any difficulties."}

All the units set up and updated themselves really quickly and I'm now getting internet about 20-30% faster upstairs and consistently in places that were sporadically before, and getting internet where there wasn't even signal.

We had the DLink Sys for 9 years and our own modem. Just last year, it started acting weird and crazy. Our internet connection becoming slow with plenty of interruptions, causing us to reboot the modem and router several times a day. Add to that, movie streaming became a nightmare. I called the internet provider twice, told us everything is working fine. They checked the line, the post, the works. The problem persisted so I called the router company for a firmware upgrade which ended up useless too. After much needled research, I came upon this product and gave it a GO. And let me tell you, it is AMAZING! It takes only 5-10 minutes to set up. If you have an existing Goggle account, much better. Customizable settings, right at your fingertips. I have a 100mbps speed. Before I set up the Goggle wifi, I was running at 42 download and 11 upload. Ridiculous right? Now that the device is set up, I'm running at more than 100mbps. Continuous movie streaming has never felt so satisfying! I have a 1500 sq ft house so 1 device is enough. Super fast speed, sleek and modern design and most of all, you can add access points anytime you want. I am truly impressed! Thank God for this...now I can rest from all the nagging and glares..."}

Spouse and I had countless arguments over reasoning so I did it! I decided to try it. (What's another $300, right?) BAM! Not only can I reduce the speed buy my Amazon TV doesn't buffer any more at a high download speed... WOW I cannot say enough of how great it feels to be \"Right\" when I argued this purchase and now I can watch whatever I want on my Amazon. I have cancelled my Cable TV and run antenna with Amazon and Netflix and I have not looked back since!!!! Now, although I bought the 3 pack, I gave the last one to my parents..

The access point is at the front of the house on the second floor. The house is big and old -- lath and plaster throughout. Our previous setup was two Apple Express modems, a base unit at the access point and an extender downstairs. Our smart TV is downstairs at the back of the house, about 25 feet from the extender modem. We have always had problems with the Apples. The link was fast and reliable in the same room as the base unit but slow (12 mb or less) and unreliable in other rooms. Performance downstairs was always not good, but over a few weeks would degrade until unusable. I would restart the network and limp along until the next reset. We lived with this until we cut the cord and went to internet TV. At best, the TV signal would buffer every 10 minutes or so and at worst it was unwatchable until I reset the network. So. Google looked the most straightforward of the mesh networks. Installation consisted of downloading the app and following very simple step by step instructions. I did encounter one hiccup. The first of the three lines of written instructions says to install the base modem, download the app and go from there. I decided to use my network attached tablet, to keep my phone free if I had to call support, so I downloaded the app to my tablet and then took down the old network and plugged in the base unit. No joy. I had to use my phone for the setup, which was completely painless, so I didn't need to call for help. I placed one router in the back of the house on the second floor -- that bedroom had never had good service -- and the third by the TV on the first floor. Everything linked up and worked. However, the Google app didn't like the first floor connection -- said it was 'weak' and suggested I move that router closer to the base unit. I did that -- moved it about 20 feet closer and Google pronounced it good. We get consistent 30 - 35 mb download speeds everywhere in the house. One caveat -- I have not tried any advanced management features, whatever those may be. But just left to itself, the network has been up for about one week and the TV signal hasn't buffered once, so we are very happy."}

I had been researching mesh networks, but decided to get a cheaper range extender first. I threw that away after a week. After arguing with Comcast for the third time, I finally just bought this system when it went on sale.\nI'm really mad I didn't buy it earlier. I was stunned at the ease of set up, and somehow even more stunned at its effectiveness. Today was the first time I could sit in my dining room and use wifi. And not just use it - but my phone felt like it was brand new because it was functioning so quickly.\nThe app is really nice to use - makes all the features that Xfinity advertises much more accessible. Xfinity says you can pause the internet, but it takes like five minutes to get there. Google - it's there within seconds. Much better access to individual devices as well. Additionally, the ability to prioritize devices is key when you have people working from home and need reliable network access.\nAnd - a small but notable thing - they look really cool.

And I can do everything remotely from my smart phone. I love it. And I never have to restart it."}

For now, they were very easy to setup - even though you need a google account and always have to be logged in. But that's easy. we just made one for the household. What we are looking for in the long run - it better range throughout the house and better performance when several people are using it. We have a 120 mbps to our house. We got these hoping that gets distributed better. our tv was choppy and several pcs were chugging. Hopefully, we continue to see solid performance.\nHow they work (this is important as it was not clear in the details when ordering):\nThese are NOT a replacement for your router. You must have a router for these to work. These simply get added to your router and extend the wifi - and hopefully, manage multiple devices better (hence their mesh network).\n\nOur previous router was trying to handle all the wifi - through a 3 story house. How the three pack works - you plug one into the router (if you think your router sucks, then you will need to buy a better one of those and then add these), set another one up down the hall. if you have multiple stories, then move one of them downstairs (or up depending on where your setup is). So far, the signal is very strong throughout the house and it's managing the network pretty well. I do recommend."}

The download speed from my ISP is 150, and it comes in at one corner of the house. I wanted to get wifi coverage to the far end of the house, and to an RV at the far end of the house where overflow family/friends often stay (wifi also doesn't like metal). There are about 20 wifi devices in my home. I had a netgear nighthawk router and extender that provided good coverage to half of the house, and poor coverage to the rest (slow speed, connection often dropped), and you can't daisy-chain the extenders. The google wifi solved the problem, and for a much more reasonable price than other router systems. I now get a download speed of 120 and up everywhere on the property, including in the RV. The best feature is that you add one unit to the modem, then you can add as many as you need in any configuration you need to get the coverage and speed you want (you don't have to do a \"satellite\" configuration like the Netgear Orbi, which wouldn't have worked for my home, and costs twice as much). Three units covered my home. Each unit has two Ethernet ports, and the one next to the modem is taken up by the modem. That only left one port for the equipment in my office that I wanted to connect with a wired connection, but an Ethernet switch solved that issue. It was quick and easy to set up, and I got a quick response from the chat feature on the app for the one question that I had. I also like that the units are small and unobtrusive. Each unit has a light that tells you that it is working, but there is an option to turn the light off. The directions say to place the units no more than 30 feet apart, but mine are about 50 feet apart and working great (they might recommend closer, because how far apart they can go depends on how much interference there is between the units). I often shop from Amazon, but this item I purchased at BestBuy because their sales staff was so informative when I was trying to figure out what to do solve the wifi coverage problem. I didn't have any problem connecting devices to the network, but I don't have any ios (apple) devices."}

{"Author": "JP Clark", "Date": "on March 9, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "the iOS app doesn't let you modify groups and we couldn't configure all 3 devices", "Text": "Our home internet has a Comcast modem/router (with WiFi) in the center of the house. Next to the modem/router we have a 16 port Netgear switch as we have devices in the house that need to be hard-wired to the network. These devices included a desktop computer, a network printer, a Philips Hue base, Samsung SmartThings hub and a Western Digital MyCloud. The Apple TVs, Amazon Echo and Dots, the Nest Protect (2) and Nest Thermostat and some WiFi power outlets are configured to use the Comcast WiFi and may get moved to the Mesh when/if it starts working and then only if there is a real need to get it off the Comcast WiFi. The Comcast router is setup to give out 10.0.0.x IP numbers and some devices (such as the printer and the WD MyCloud) have static IP numbers assigned to them so they can always be found.\n\nReading up on the Google Mesh and TP-Link Deco before buying seems to indicate that the best results come from using Ethernet cable to connect all three units. This allows \"backhaul\" of data between the Mesh units. From a network administration background, this makes sense. So I planned to run network cables from the North and South end of the house to the center where the Comcast internet connection is currently located.\n\nWe bought the Google Mesh 3-pack from Amazon. Setting up the first access point was simple and easy after downloading the app to my iPhone, It even lets me use my existing Google account to logon to the app. We plugged the Mesh point into the Netgear switch. I connected my iPhone to it and things looked good.\nWe added the second Mesh point easily, it was not hard-wired to the network, it was just feeding off the WiFi from the first unit. It is at the North end of the house. We started putting more devices on the new WiFi and life was good! Devices that had poor WiFi now had good solid WiFi. We also started working on running Ethernet cable for the 2 Mesh points that were not near the incoming internet modem/router. When we hooked up the cable to the first access point in the master bedroom we couldn't see any change in the App. It didn't tell us if the Mesh point was hard wired or only using WiFi.\nWe ran the network cable for the 3rd Mesh unit, it is going in the South end of the house. If we left the cable unplugged we could configure the device but when we plugged the cable in, the app wouldn't see it. That's when I noticed the 2nd unit had a blue light that indicated it wasn't setup. After several attempts to configure things I discovered that only one of the remote Mesh points (one being the primary point) could be configured and active at one time.\n\nThe Google app also seems to suck, at least the iOS version. I could create a group and put devices in these groups. I can then prioritize or suspend a single device or a group of devices. But once I created a group and assigned devices to it, I couldn't add new devices to an existing group. There are a few devices I'd like to permanently give priority to, but priority and suspending both have automatic time limits. The app also showed that the Google Mesh was giving out IP numbers in the 192.168.x.x network range. this means anything connected to the Google Mesh can see the 10.0.0.x devices, but the 10.0.0.x devices couldn't see anything connected to the Mesh. The Mesh is working as a router, DHCP server and doing NAT and I couldn't change this in the App.\n\nWe returned this and bought the TP-Link Deco system and that seems to work much better.\nWe bought both items with my husband's email address (the same Amazon Prime account) so it looks like I didn't buy it, but we did."}

I have tried repeaters, mesh extenders and have always been disappointed in coverage.\n\nThat said, it has one fatal flaw. It SIGNIFICANTLY reduces your wifi signal. I verified this with some online video reviews after I noticed the issue. Realistically, my home has about a 47 Mbs connection from the ISP. That's the download speed I get from my wifi near the old wifi router. With Google Wifi, I get 25 Mbs or about half my available bandwidth near the primary access point. Both of the secondary access points product only 10 Mbs or less than a quarter of the original speed. Positioning the access points is an important factor and the access points test themselves during setup and tell you if they need to be moved. Google wifi access points said they are in a \"great\" position.\n\nWhile these are solid devices, I want to be able to access the speed I am paying my ISP for.\n\nUpdate: I just bought and installed the Eero mesh devices that are very similar, but about $100 more than these Google devices.

So I bit the bullet and got the 3 pack Google WiFi.\n\nThere was one hiccup with setting this up: the devices wouldn't respond to the app at first. After talking to the very very helpful customer service representative (perhaps this is where the Google Wallet support staff ended up?), I learned that I probably have a returned Google WiFi set in my possession, and all I had to do was factory reset the devices.\n\nOnce that was done, there were zero issues. The app works a treat, keeps tabs on everything connected to the WiFi, and makes access management a breeze. Sure, I wouldn't use it in an enterprise setting, but this Just Works way better than the old Airport ever did. I've used network extenders before, and they were a royal pain in the butt. While pricier, these will deliver WiFi to where you need it, unless your building is a Faraday cage.\n\nWell, ok, one problem did happen: I lost access to the wired local area network attached to the router, and the printer that was attached to it (the WiFi can't access other devices on the upstream router in mesh mode). That was solved by attaching an Ethernet switch to the LAN port of one of the devices."}

Now, with simply upgrading to Google wifi, I'm topping out at 70 (!) mbps speed, more than double what I'm actually paying for. And since I've got 3 routers throughout the house, there's not a dark corner in the house that I'm not getting at least 30 mbps. I'm blown away. So before Google wifi, my rare high end was 30 mbps (the actual speed I pay for); now with google wifi 60-70 is normal, 30 mbps is the absolute low end. Super easy to set up.

{"Author": "CB", "Date": "on February 20, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Amazing network option!", "Text": "I purchased this WiFi system because I felt like I needed better whole home coverage since I find myself purchasing more and more connected devices. We have a 3000 sq. ft. home with 2 levels. Previously we had an airport extreme in the basement in the center, and 2 airport extremes upstairs in each corner of the house (with the hope that it would provide whole home coverage). While an Airport Extreme is an excellent router, it lacks in the area of communicating well with other routers and allowing devices to switch between those routers easily. Additionally, the upstairs routers would frequently connect to each other, rather than the basement, creating a huge chain of routers which slows speed dramatically. That's where this WiFi system comes in.\n\nIn the box:\nIn the box you have 3 identical routers. It doesn't matter which you pull out first and set up first. Additionally, there is a power cable for each one, and a network cable to hook up to your modem. The packaging is aesthetically pleasing and sleek.\nEach router has an LED light ring surrounding it which services as a way of telling you if it's powered on and connected. There are 2 ethernet ports on the bottom (1 works as the connection to your modem, and the other for a network device). If you plug in a device to an extension router, then you can use both ports for devices. There is not a USB port, so if you have USB network devices (a printer, for example), then this router is not for you.\n\nSetup:\nIf I had any complaints about my experience as a whole, it would be in this area. Setting up the router was not as easy as it should have been. In the box, there is a small card that guides you to download the iOS or Android Google WiFi app. After doing so, I followed the prompts to set up the first router. However, when I would enter my network information, it would always lock up and eventually tell me it can't connect to the router (which was in the same room as me). After multiple failed attempts, the app prompted me to connect to the router directly via my WiFi settings. At that point, it worked. Setting up the 2nd and 3rd routers were the easiest network task I have ever done.\n\nUsage:\nWhile I realize 3 routers for a 3000 square foot home is slightly overkill, it does provide an excellent amount of coverage, and I don't find any problems with it. The thing I like most is they use the \"mess WiFi\" technology. This allows the routers to work together rather than just connect to the base router. So, if I am upstairs in my office (with a router) and I walk downstairs to the basement (where the base router is) then my phone will automatically switch to the basement router making my WiFi speeds faster and more efficient. Specifically, I have a ring doorbell, which is literally on the other side of the wall from my office. With the Airports, the doorbell would connect to the basement router, because it was the \"king.\" This made it impossible to keep a stable connection with the doorbell. However, with the Google WiFi system, it always keeps connected to the office router, and has zero issues whatsoever. Overall, we usually have 20-25 devices connected at a time with no issues.\n\nApp:\nThe Google WiFi app is pretty good, but lacks a little bit. The biggest thing I hate about it is it's not optimized for iPhone X. That has been out for a long time now and Google should get their act together. In the app, you create a guest network, pause internet for specific devices, turn on Google SafeSearch for specific devices for internet browsing, see real time data such as network usage and speeds, adjust the brightness of the led ring on each router (awesome!), and tinker with specific internet settings. I am not an advanced network user that likes to fine tune everything in a specific way, so this works for me. However, I could see there being a problem if you like to do that, since the capability is limited.\n\nI've read issues that this has had in the past, but other than the hiccup with setup, I cannot see any issues. I strongly recommend setting this system up, as it has made a huge difference in our home network."}

The hardest part (which was really quite simple) was disabling the router option so that our combo is now a modem only. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the Google system. We went from download speeds of less than 20 Mbps to 110+ Mbps and we now have a full WiFi signal in every corner of our house. It\u2019s so great to finally get the level of internet service we\u2019re paying for!!"}

I have internet services through a cable provider and pay for a 300mbps service. I bought a set of 3 routers to place across my house and on initial setup, the WiFi app reported speeds above 250mbps. After some time (assuming some device updates were applied) my WiFi app started reporting speeds below 200 mbps consistently and speedTest.net tests on my laptop showed speeds below 100 mbps (download speeds in all cases).\nThrough multiple rounds of technical support calls, the google team had me modify dns settings, switch on and off router points/modems and generate multiple reports and logs. The final explanation from technical support was that signals from my neighbors were causing network congestion and preventing the google WiFi network from delivering optimum performance. Furthermore, technical support claimed that no other manufacturer can solve this problem and that the google devices can\u2019t be returned under warranty because this isn\u2019t an issue (even though they can\u2019t deliver performance because of external interference). Overall, this experience was doubly disappointing not only because of device performance but also because of bad customer service and lack of ownership. I won\u2019t be buying any more Google products in the near future (did not expect this sub-par perfromance and bad customer service from Google..very disappointed)"}

Google has done a wonderful job of boiling down the average user's needs and providing a streamlined and straightforward process to handle them.\nThe router does a fantastic job of keeping the connection rock solid. It also provides good coverage. It doesn't send the signal quite as far as other traditional routers might, but it does a much better job of automatically selecting the best channels and controlling connections, and it certainly works just fine covering all 2600 square feet of our home.\nThis is the router I've always wanted.

Every other router I've ever had has had an intimidating and opaque user interface, If you need to configure something about these others you have to wade through multiple menus of features you car barely understand. Google WiFi, by contrast, manages alsmot all of those features for you - not showing you the things you wouldn't know what to do with anyway. I can't imagine that there is more than one user in a thousand who would need the pre-configured features.\n2. The two techie features it leaves available are IP reservation and port forwarding. In 25 years of internet software development these are the only special features I've ever really needed to manage. GWF lets mew name my devices with names I can remember and doesn't even LET me worry about such things as MAC addresses - which it manages for me.\n3. Setup was absolutely intuitive.

{"Author": "Palo Altan", "Date": "on February 4, 2018", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "... wifi access points circa 2010 to the latest and greatest ac/dual radio/mesh technology", "Text": "I purchased a set of three Google Wifi units to upgrade my wifi network at home from b/g/n series wifi access points circa 2010 to the latest and greatest ac/dual radio/mesh technology.\n\nInstallation was easy and I was up and running in less than 20 minutes with a mesh grid of all three access points. I have an 11K ft2 property with multiple structures. I put the main router unit (which was plugged into my network via ethernet) at one end of my main house and I put another satellite unit at the other end of my main house. I put the second satellite unit in my garage (separate structure in the corner of the property).\n\nSpeedtests: At various locations around the property from an Mac OS laptop were as follows: From any location in the main house I was able to get\nspeeds easily exceeding 100Mbps. The highest was 140Mbps. From my Garage and from locations in my yard near to my garage I was able to get speeds up to 50Mbps (average was about 44Mbps). Decent speeds. Based on speeds alone, I'd say the Google gets 3 stars because I have heard of much better speeds from mesh dual radio systems but still, 43MBps at the far reaches of the mesh is plenty for streaming video.\n\nBut for me, the fun stopped there. The main issue I had with the system was that it is designed strictly for people who have absolutely zero understanding or interest in computer networking and is very limited in how you can setup your network. The software that you install on your phone goes to great lengths to protect you from all technical details. This could be a good thing for some and that was indeed one reason why I purchased this system (because my wife wanted something that she could fix when I was gone and she knows zero and cares zero about computer networks) That said, I think there is a limit to how simple one can or should make something that is fundamentally technically complex. In my opinion Google crosses the line with this system trying to deliver wifi configuration and management in a wrapper of non-technical consumer messaging similar to what you might find on your facebook app.\n\nHere's some examples:\n\nNetwork Setup: The system configures an ip network automatically without prompting you for an ip address or subnet, DHCP range or anything else other than the SSID name. It does the same with wifi security. You can change the ip addresses later under the advanced settings section but not the wifi security. You have a particular type of wifi security you want? or your curious what Google is using? Sorry. I could see no way to Wifi security settings settings or change them.\n\nRadios: There is no ability to adjust the power or direction of the radios. The Google solution seems to be to just try moving the wifi pods around to different spots.\n\nNow for the worst: The router. So in the CNET review that I read, it clearly stated that Google Wifi can be used in either bridge mode or as a router/gateway directly to your modem. Since I have already a VERY high performance Ubiquiti router, this review was important to me because it meant that I can implement Google Wifi as a wifi mesh solution only and not disturb my very high performing core wired network or routing. The truth is (rather hilariously) quite different. This solution in my testing ONLY functions as a router/gateway replacing your existing router. It MUST plug directly into your modem in order for it to work as it has been designed. The router functionality provides layer 2 network that cannot be configured or turned off. So if you have a router already you are stuck with double NAT and all the issues this brings. Now the hilarious part. There is in fact a setting under the advanced network configuration settings section that ostensibly allows you to switch the system into bridge mode. But nowhere during setup does it give you the opportunity to do this. It does not sense that you already have a layer 2 network setup. It just goes ahead and configures it's own router, gateway and network. Then when you try to change it to bridge mode later the toggle switch is grayed out and there is only one clickable link on the page that says \"Device mode has been automatically set. Learn more\". upon clicking this takes you to a verbose help article which i am compelled to paste here in it's entirety so as to save others like me a lot of wasted time:\n\n\"Bridge mode\nMost people won\u2019t need bridge mode, but for those who do, we\u2019ve outlined some recommended setups below.\nWhen to use Bridge mode: Bridge mode is only needed when encountering specific cases of Double NAT. For most people, Double NAT does not affect Wi-Fi performance. But it can be an issue if you play online games or use IP address assignments, port forwarding rules, and UPnP. Learn more about Double NAT and when you might need Bridge mode.\nDoes Google Wifi support Bridge mode?\nYeah, but it will only work if you\u2019re using a single Wifi point. If you\u2019re creating a mesh network with multiple Wifi points, your Primary Wifi point cannot be in Bridge mode. This is because the Primary Wifi point needs to do special things to control settings and communication within your Wi-Fi network. If it\u2019s in bridge mode, you\u2019ll lose some of Google Wifi\u2019s key features.\nHow do I enable bridge mode?\nIf you are only using a single Google Wifi point andDouble NAT is causing problems, you have two options:\nEnable bridge mode on your ISP-provided modem/router (RECOMMENDED)\nEnable bridge mode on your primary Wifi point (NOT RECOMMENDED\"\n\nOK! Great. So in summary if you play online gaming, use UPnP, have any port forwarding setup, or have assigned IPs, Or [let me add] print! ..(from any device wired into your ISP provided router)... you CANT use Google Wifi as a mesh system! The hilarious part is that the toggle switch is even there! Why not just make this abundantly clear to people up front?!?!\n\nBottom line this system is NOT a wifi mesh system alone. It is an ALL-IN-ONE home network. You will need everything in your house to be on the Google wifi network or plugged into one of the LAN ports provided on one of the Google wifi pods. (Each Google pod gives you two LAN ports accept for the one acting as the router which gives you one.\n\nSo why is this so bad? Well for starters the router functionality itself will become the bottle neck in your network quite easily if you have traffic of a typical house (50=-75 devices including IoT, security cameras, mobile devices, consoles, HiFi, Smart TVs, etc.) Even with a quad core ARM processor (That Google advertises as a feature on the \"lets get technical\" section of their online sales brochures), acting as a MESH main access point and a gateway/router is going to put too much burden on a single Google pod. The odd thing is that the same compliment of computing is being wasted on the other pods acting as satellites.\n\nSome other points about the router:\nQOS -> has been renamed \"Priority device\" Singular not plural. You can pick just one!\nVLAN -> has been renamed \" Guest Network\" and yes you guessed it. You can setup only one!\nPort Forwarding and DHCP reservations are configurable but sadly the port forwarding does not support ranges and port forward rules cannot be edited once created. The only option is to delete and start over.\nThere is a potentially cool feature available called \"Family Wi-Fi\" that allows you to enable website filtering of adult sites, and pause WAN connectivity but it does not work unless you enable the Google cloud services that sniff your network. (more on that next)\n\nDo No Evil - Ok I had to include this in my review... So There is also a \"Privacy\" settings under \"network & general\" section. (I went poking in here as part of my futile attempt to understand how the Wifi security had been setup.) This section has three toggle switches all by default have been turned on. What do they do? Again I feel compelled to paste the un-abridged version herein (refer to screen shot).\n\nSo in essence, without notifying the user Google has basically setup network sniffing at the layer 2 router level of your private network and is reporting stats back to Google! And the quad core CPU that is already over burdened is doing that processing too! It should be noted that unlike setting up an Apple device where you know there will be that one screen during setup that asks you permission to turn on reporting back to Apple, with this Google Wifi there was no such screen or notification during setup. Oh and they also set the DNS to 8.8.8.8 and only 8.8.8.8. (for those who don't know 8.8.8.8 is Google's main public internet domain name server) All this can be changed. But its a bit sneaky and IMHO a violation privacy to pre-configure it to the lowest level of privacy. The target non-technical user of this system will probably never even know.\n\nSo in summary Thanks Amazon for the 30 day return policy. I very much appreciate trying this system out.\nI give this a 2 star rating for a person like me. For a complete non tech person who just wants to plug in and go, I maybe give it 3 stars. It will probably be better than what your ISP gives you in terms of wifi performance. But you MUST put your other router in bridge mode and you MUST be aware of the monitoring Google will be doing of your network activity.\n\nIn my opinion this device is a really more about maintaining and extending Google dominance of your online usage than anything else. It is a $300 system that arguably benefits Google more than the consumer who paid or it."}

With come setups that use power injectors for over the air broadband, they do not work where pretty much all other routers do; even one that I had laying around that is over 10 years old. So, if you experience any problems getting to certain websites or streaming Netflix, getting emails, etc., make sure you return them immediately. I contacted google support and after months of troubleshooting they refuse to refund as it is past the 30 day return now, but was not when I initially reported the problem to Google. Their latest suggestion is to try using another router in bridge mode and then plug the Google Wifi into that router to see if that solves it. Haven't tried that yet, but seriously... Does Google really expect customers to buy a router to make their \"router replacement\" work? I guess so... So much for their \"router replacement\" advertising.\n\nJust to let other know that if you see any initial problems with connecting to some websites and services after setup, don't bother troubleshooting... just bring it back to where you bought them for a refund. Otherwise you will end up with some expensive paper weights like me.."}

It's more user-friendly than the old style routers & access points by far. We're using this with Spectrum (Bright House) cable. They provided a router to get the internet into the house, and then our Google wifi point is plugged into that.\n\nThere's only one wired \"out\" port on the Google Wifi point, so if you need to plug more stuff in, it either needs to get plugged directly into your ISP's router, or you need to get a hub. Spectrum's router had three open \"out\" spots on it, so we ended up not needing a hub, but it's worth keeping in mind."}

I found the Google Wifi system had great reviews. So far this thing is amazing. Simple to setup with the google wifi app. Speeds are amazing. I only bought one and is strong enough to supply wifi to all levels of our 2,100sqft home, two story house with a basement. I have it in the top level our house and the signal is strong enough to reach the basement without any issue. Google even sends an email to let you know how well your system is doing. I always thought I needed a router with all the antenna's to get the job done. Guess not. This by far the best router i've ever owned. Keep up the good work Goog."}

Within an hour of the Google Wifi system's delivery I had removed the old hardware and setup the Google system. There's no dead spots anywhere and the signal on the third floor is near perfect. There's one thing to be aware of. Many older routers are configured with the ip address 192.168.1.1. The Google system's base router ip address is 192.168.86.1. if anyone's configured any of their wireless devices like a wifi printer with a fixed ip address, for example 192.168.1.100 change it to 192.168.86.xxx before you connect it to the Google system."}

I previously had 3 - Apple Extreme WiFi AC routers through out the house connected with an ethernet backbone and replaced them the Google WiFi routers. 2 of the routers are on an ethernet backbone and the other one is connected via MESH. Overall getting similar coverage as the Apples, but overall the connection speed is even better. The reason my connection speed is better was that I could never get the channel setting right on the Apples, but on the Google they're dynamic channel selection is much better so they always seem to select the clear channels. In terms of connectivity for all the Smart Home accessories, the Google WiFi pucks have been very good. No lost connectivity thus far for any of the cameras, smart lights, sensors, etc... and no slow down of performance seen. Further, the size, the weight and the aesthetics of the Google routers are much better than the Apple. The software makes the routers easy to manage, test your internet performance/coverage, and to see what's using all of your internet data. If you want a lot of control with dictating things those are a little more hidden.\n\nThe only thing I wish the routers had was a couple more ethernet ports instead of the single one for output."}

What's interesting is that during the day, typical downspeed on my Samsung GS7 is ~80Mbps, but at night i can get over 250Mbps.\nSo i ran speedtest on three devices at ~the same time: GS7, iphone6s, ipad4. They are all pulling from one google module and i get the following download speeds:\nGS7=68Mbps\niphone6s=153Mbps\nipad4= 79Mbps\nIf i run either phone solo, they will get ~250Mbps (ipad4 nvr gets above 101). When i run speedtest from my desktop (wired through the google main) I get 300Mbps (xfinity max). It appears that each google module can only handle the ISP maximum shared with any number of devices.\nIn our small house we have so many devices competing for wireless bandwith: roku, amazon fire tablet, asus windows tablet, 2 ipads, 2 laptops, 4 phones, xbox, nintendo switch, etc; granted only 3 or 4 devices are pulling at any given time, but it's nice to know that (with my 2 modules...with a large overlap area) several people can be 'working wireless' at the same time.\nNo one in the house has ever complained about dropped signal or lag and i haven't had to reboot the router or modem (it's only been a few weeks, so we'll see)."}

{"Author": "Resident Skeptic", "Date": "on January 26, 2018", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "It changed my life .. and how!", "Text": "My \"before\" setup had a Belkin N600 dual radio in the den, connected via 2 Ethernet powerline adapters to 2 other rooms driving a D-Link AC750 each. One AC 750 turned out to be flaky and had to be put to sleep. The other one chugged along at an acceptable speed. That remaining AC750 was the source for our Netflix connection. Seldom did a day pass without a breakage in connectivity and manual restoration (via quitting Netflix and resuming it after 30s or so) and we had gotten used to this mode of operation.\n\nMy better half replaced my 4 year old Moto phone with another, more modern, Moto around Thanksgiving and I was getting used to it. Meanwhile, the Netflix disruptions were getting too much to bear around the holiday season, with snow/ice outside and not much else going on. I bit the bullet and splurged on a 3-device mesh. Out went the Belkin and DLink routers and the pair of powerline Ethernet adapters and their wired mess. Ugh!\n\nInitial setup revealed some teething pains .. which surfaced when my 8 year old Vonage ATA died of old age probably upon finding that it had been connected to a modern router. Vonage rep wanted $79 for the ATA, then $9 for S&H, then waived everything. The smaller, sleeker ATA arrived a couple days later and worked just fine.\n\nA second issue emerged and I suspected that one of the routers was iffy (e.g., it showed a red light a couple of times, Goog WiFi reported that a device in the setup has a clashing IP address, and overall, in its vicinity, connection to my new Moto would stall, disconnect and then go quiet - no Internet!). Moving the router around a bit and restarting the mesh seemed to help initially a bit, but devolved to the same old behavior. Some more troubleshooting ensued in which I suspected that the Moto was flaking out. Whaaaat? The 4 yo Moto could still connect to and hold the connection, but the less than 2 mo Moto was dying right before my eyes! Moto customer service was involved and a session of troubleshooting confirmed my suspicion. Under warranty, Motorola offered to replace my device. My inner voice shouted - run - this is your chance to live outside of the \"2 GB RAM\" prison, and run I did to Costco, whose generous policy allowed me a refund a day short of 2 months from the date of purchase. I could have \"played\" with the phone for another month and Costco would still have taken it back.\n\nMr Murphy famously said - the solution to a problem changes the problem - and my problem had now become finding a new phone. I did that and spent a mini fortune on a device I had vetted exhaustively (touch wood!).\n\nOur neighborhood was visited by the Gods of thunder and lightning recently and as a side effect, my cable modem decided to hang up its boots too. Though I cannot ascribe it completely to the Goog WiFi :-) I had to change that too.\n\nOh, and then the laptop sitting next to a router dropped down to 2 Mbps speed - unbelievable - and in looking up solutions to the problem, I discovered the magic of 'winsock reset' .. which sets the connection speed to >800 Mbps for at least a week. Phew!\n\nStory-telling apart, the mesh provides a solid connection with a single SSID and no Netflix drops. As you move around in the house, your mobile device connects to the optimal router. From a smartphone, you can check mesh status, connectivity to the Internet, and which devices connected to the network are consuming data. The last one is important - it tells me that my teenage kid is still up and active, and I can either talk in person, or set a rule to disallow access to certain devices routinely. The app is the cherry on the top, very functional and easy to use. You can prioritize device access, for instance, your work computer, or your TV streaming Netflix in order to get a better end-user experience. I can happily say that I do not miss my messy setup from the \"before\" life at all. Good riddance!\n\nIf I had to change one thing - it would be the power cable design that feeds the pucks. It is hard to discern which side is which. Why couldn't Goog use Type-C connectors which are reversible?"}

I do have network experience but it was almost totally unnecessary with this device. I had been experiencing a lot of slow speed and disconnects on my network until I paired these with a new gigabyte router. Now things run smoothly and without the delays and slowdowns that had plagued me for months. The one disadvantage is that the ability to configure is limited but I guess that is what you really need, a seamless, well integrated hands off solution. Installation was a breeze and these can be setup by a novice just as easily as by a veteran like myself. I have three of these in my multi-story 2800 sq ft home and they work flawlessly so far (been a couple of months)."}

Then a friend told me about\nGoogle WiFi and I thought at this point I have nothing to lose, except for someone to install it for me, after reading the reviews online about how easy it was to set up I decided to try it on my own. Since I had the modem/router combination unit I had to call Spectrum and instruct them to turn off the wireless portion on the modem, that was the hardest part of the whole install, everything else was super easy. Trust me,\nyou can do it. Before the install I was getting about 45 mbps sitting right next to my old router and in the basement I was getting form 6-12 mbps, not good.

At the time, I was using the Apple AirPort Extreme and bridged an Apple AirPort Express. My house is only about 1600 sq ft so this should have been fine but we were losing signal dramatically at the other end of the house. Not sure if it was the materials of the walls but I had to use the cellular network when I was in my son\u2019s room. This led me to consider running an Ethernet cable from my router to the other end of the house.\n\nThen I looked into Google\u2019s Wifi system and found that you can bridge more access points than Apple\u2019s AirPorts. Currently, you can only extend Apple\u2019s Wifi system once from the router. Google can create a net to cover multiple directions and a greater distance. Also, Apple has not upgraded their Wifi systems in over 4 years.\n\nNow, our Wifi reaches all corners of the house with close to 100mbps everywhere. No more buffering when streaming from Plex or Netflix. This system saved me the installation fee of hardwiring ethernet cables. The set up was very quick and easy and the app is very clear and intuitive. Google\u2019s system also provides other services such as giving a device priority, checking Wifi speeds, and setting up guest and family Wifi. I also like the idea of being able to extend the network even more if I wanted to although I probably will not need to. This is probably a best bet for small businesses or larger homes with multiple levels.\n\nI would definitely recommend this system to everyone as I am very pleased with the results."}

By Christmas 2017, the first unit completely failed and would no longer connect to the network. I'm a network engineer so it's not my first rodeo.\n\nWhat's very troubling is by its nature, mesh technology should prevent a single point of failure. When a google wifi node fails, it takes down the entire wifi network with it. The symptoms include the flash red band. When you try to reconnect the device, it complains that you need to move it closer to the hub, but it still can't find it whether you try on the primary or guest network. You can reset it, but it still can't connect.\n\nSo, I've tried resetting the Verizon FIOS router, the Wifi hub and the entire network to no avail . Finally, I just had to throw the dead one in a box because the warranty is 30 days only.\n\nThe second one died two weeks later.\n\nBefore this, I had Netgear wifi throughout the house. While spotty, it never failed in all the years I had it up and before that - Apple's wireless which also never failed in five years. So, I think this is not a quality product for the cost associated with it. It's well over $500 for the hub and 3 hot spots.\n\nSupport? You can try the online forums, call into the support number where they follow a script for what you've already done or they can call you back and tell you to do what you've already done.

My last router was an Asus and it performed pretty good and still works. I was looking to replace my router with something that could increase my wifi range. I tried several routers. The first was a Netgear Nighthawk AC3200. It worked for about a day and then it started rebooting itself, dropping all my clients. Not acceptable. That was returned. The next one I tried was a TP Link AC3200. It also worked for about a day and started dropping clients and not working reliably. I couldn't even stream from one device without buffering. Not acceptable. I was starting to think it was something else interfering. When I installed each router I made sure that it didn't interfere with any other wifi signals around me. I tested to see what channel to broadcast on and configured it to that channel. Still dropping clients. Getting fed up I decided to try this Google WiFi system. Installation was a breeze through the Google WiFi app. I configured my wireless and then began the task of installing all my cameras. This requires port forwarding. I installed each camera with no problem. I wasn't able to access them remotely though so port forwarding was not working correctly. My cameras are UPnP compliant so I enabled this through the app. I found that this was the problem. I disabled UPnP and I was then able to access remotely. So far so good. I will update in about a month. Hopefully this will have solved my wifi problems.\n\nUPDATE 03-23-18: It has been about two months and everything is working flawlessly. I am very happy with this system. I would definitely recommend these. Hopefully Google will continue to add features to the app to make this even better.\n\nUPDATE 05-07-18: System still working flawlessly. Have not had any issues with connections or speed. I have six IP cameras hooked up to my system and they work great. I can access them with no problem remotely."}

First floor square footage is about 2500 sq.ft. but the walls and 3 chimneys seem to cause standard modems some fits in certain places. The second floor is smaller but is the source of some of the dead spots.\n\nThe Good: Have to say, I'm pretty impressed. Much better than using repeaters as I have before. The throughput is really good. Have a 100 Mbps service and usually test at between 60 and 100 Mbps over wifi depending on how far I am away from the points. Certainly simplifies things for anyone on my network. Just one SSID everywhere. I was also able to connect my primary point to a gigabit switch. Throughput through ethernet was perfect. Easily out-performed old router with its 100/10 Mbps ethernet ports. Oh, and the price is pretty good for a 3 point mesh network.\n\nThe Different: Wasn't sure how I'd like using an app instead of a web interface. I feel like there are a lot of the normal features I'm used to just not implemented on the Google Wifi yet, but using the app isn't a big deal versus a web browser. All the main features I want are there but some are limited or challenging to implement (see 'The Bad'). Also might be a minor hiccup for anyone that does not yet have a google account yet.\n\nThe Bad: Set up was a hassle for me. Full disclosure - I have a static IP service which is not normal for most people. The normal setup process assumes you have a DHCP provided ip address from your service provider. If your's is static, you will need to try the setup a couple times till it basically fails out. Took me two tries to finally get it to talk to my modem. It was in a weird state, but I could access the advanced features through my phone app. Then you can go into the advanced network settings to add your custom ip, netmask, and gateway info. Couple restarts and I was finally up and running.\n\nThe REAL problems occur if you have devices internally on your LAN that have static ip addresses. I use a NAS, some controllers, and a DNS filter device on my network that use static ip's and I port forward to some of these. The Google Wifi router will not see them natively as an option when trying to port forward to. It only sees the devices assigned DHCP addresses by the router itself and there is no option to just type in the static ip. Ugh!\n\nThe process to get this to work was to switch the device to dynamic addressing, let it join the network, then from Google Wifi request an ip address reservation for that device. [Also hope that the device is named something non-generic because all you see is the name and MAC address. If you have 3 raspberry pi devices, it can be hard to find the correct one]. When requesting the reservation, you can decide what the static ip address will be, but if you change it, you will need to get back on the device somehow and reset the nic back to that static ip address. I had to reboot my NAS once during that process to get it all to talk. Not a lot of fun. And definitely not easy or straight forward. My old ASUS router handled all this very easily.\n\nI am really hoping a firmware upgrade will change all that in the future. Would also really like the capability to provide VPN service from the Google Wifi, which my previous router did. I'm going to keep using this for now and see how it evolves over time. I'm optimistic."}

The internet was faster than ever throughout the house but then all of a sudden 4 months later the internet would not work as fast and in some spots of the house did not work at all even though previously it was working fine. I contacted Google wifi team and they had me go through a whole bunch of tests that went on for weeks and at the end they said that there is congestion on my network. I didn't understand because I talked to many different reps and all said that there was no congestion but it appears since they could not find anything wrong that's all they could say. I continued to reach out to them for answers but haven't received anymore responses from them. Since they stopped responding to me I decided to purchase an Orbi and I have to say that the Orbi in my opinion is way better than the Google WiFi system. I'm getting blazing speeds again and have one less satellite in the house. The kids are happy, the wife is happy, so I'm happy. Still to this day I've tired to get support from Google WiFi regarding the wifi that I have an it's non existence. Because of this I will never purchase another Google wifi and I'm never going to recommend one to anyone. I'm not sure why this wifi stopped working as I have the same amount of devices connected to it as the Orbi and the same amount of devices from my neighbors are still around so I don't believe it's congestion that caused this issue. I have read other reviews with people that have the same problems with the Google wifi so there must be something defective with this product. I also tried returning this product to Amazon but since it's past the 30 days they said I have to work with Google but they are not willing to fix the product."}

Our old system would constantly give us issues, with unreliable Wifi. For example, you may have been connected to the range extender instead of the primary point, despite being close to the primary access point. Or the range extender had trouble connecting to the access point, and any devices connected to the range extender had issues. With Google Wifi, everything is working flawlessly with great speeds throughout the house. Could be some other mesh network is faster, but for us this is about as perfect as it gets. The idea of a smart mesh network, helps ensure that your device is always using the best route of connections as opposed to sticking with connections too long. I would definitely stay away from anything but mesh networks going forward. For home use, the network options seem to be sufficient; could be if you have some technical needs you might need a different brand. For me, Google Wifi is fine. Only complaint, would like to have more LAN ports, on the main point. Don't need more then one LAN port in general, but once in a while it comes in handy. Maybe would just get a small switch to keep handy if I ever need an extra port or two."}

I'm not tech-stupid but I'm also no genius, and networking has never been my wheelhouse. I've always had difficulty over the past three or four years with getting good, strong signals to all corners of the house. We've had more nights than I can remember of settling in for a movie on \"the good TV\" only to suffer the wrath of the buffering wheel due to the distance and walls between it and the router.\n\nAfter fiddling with different combinations of modems, routers, repeaters, etc., none of which really had any positive effect on our connectivity, I threw in the towel: we were just going to have to deal with switching our phones to LTE in the bedroom, or re-connecting to the wifi every time the office laptop was kicked off of it, or finishing the popcorn before the movie actually starts. Then I saw something about this \"mesh network\" stuff.\n\nAfter poking around, I found out about Google Wifi. Some more digging and I saw a lot of great reviews saying that it works wonders and is SIMPLE. Negative reviews said it's not advanced enough, i.e. it's TOO SIMPLE. Perfect for someone like me that doesn't want to fuss over anything and just wants it to work.\n\nThe devices are small, clean, and attractive; the accompanying app is informative, intuitive, and responsive; setup was as close to plug-and-play as I could get; maintenance is, as yet, not needed because I've had no issues.\n\nEach corner of each room has just as strong a signal as the corner of the room furthest from it. We're pulling speeds upstairs that we've never before seen. Our phones no longer stall out on wifi; my wife no longer gets kicked off her laptop; Netflix streams in 4k with ease. These were all small issues in the grand scheme of things, but the tiniest annoyances become quite frustrating when they continue to pile up. Our home life is a little less frustrating now and we couldn't be any happier for it.\n\nOne note: I also got a mount called The Spot by Mount Genie - it's pretty convenient as it allows each node to hang from the outlet into which it's plugged just by holding onto the plug itself.The Spot for Google WiFi by Mount Genie: The Simplest Wall Mount Holder Stand Bracket for Google WiFi routers and beacons.

I have speeds I've never seen before, and no more wifi dead zones. My Tivo, which connects wirelessly and which has rarely gotten more than 50% (\"marginal\") connectivity, finally has 100% connectivity! I'm extremely pleased with this product. However, I'm taking off one star because Google's advice on how many wifi spots you need is confusing. They say that an apartment that is 1500 square feet or less only needs one access point. But the set-up instructions advise you to not set up an access point that is more than one room away from another. Although my apartment is about 800 square feet, it contains several thick (concrete, not sheetrock) internal walls. A single Google wifi point was not able to reach through two walls from my office (where my cable modem is) to my bedroom (although it did so better than the Apple Airport Express did). I had to return the single unit and order the set of three. Once I set these up, each no more than one room away from another, they worked amazingly well. Just be aware that you may need more units than Google claims."}

This seems to be a good system for a medium size home, but not so much for large areas or in my case, building to building WiFi. I was using a Netgear range extender previously to share my neighbor's WiFi, which delivered near full bandwidth but better results when plugged into it. I wanted to bring that device upstairs and figured I would add a Google WiFi point to add to my neighbor's mesh system which I had setup for them. Even with the main point near the window and my WiFi point near the window, throughput was good to weak at times. Reading various IT professional reviews it seemed the common complaint was lack of power. These units are just not big enough to deliver in situations where there is interference with walls & glass. At their house however, the results were excellent from front of the house to the back on the same floor. So take into account if you need large range and power, better go with Netgear."}

My frame of reference here is not the two in one ISP router. I've used many different routers in the past including the ASUS CM-32, Netgear AC1750, D-Link AC3200, Netgear Nighthawk X8 and the Netgear Nighthawk AC1900. This one is by far the best I've ever used. Here's why...\n\nSetup:\nRouter setup is usually a bit of a cumbersome process involving web interfaces that can be buggy (Asus was particularly buggy). Not here. The Google Wifi system is entirely driven through a smart phone app. It was a quick step by step installation and provided enhanced functionality like port forwarding.\n\nCoverage:\nHaving three nodes covering the corners of my home has allowed me to get good coverage everywhere. Previously only the Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 even got close. Now every corner of every room is capable of streaming HD video, and most can perform at 4K levels on Wifi.\n\nUsability:\nMoving from room to room is a painless exercise. The transition is mostly seamless, with only an occasional hiccup when moving from node to node. Managing the network is easy. The app interface is polished and fully featured, allowing you to perform detailed diagnostics and even running regular speed tests.\n\nCons:\nThe only negative of this device is it only supports one wired connection. This can be easily resolved with a switch though, so it doesn't lose a star for that."}

Ring uses 2.4 MHz. When I set up this Google Mesh, I named the network the same as my previous SSID. The Ring cameras immediately picked this up and connected to the 2.4 MHz band. Two days in, no problems.\n\nThe only issue I have encountered is apparently a non-issue. When I first set the mesh network up and place my WiFi points, the Ring cameras connected to these specific locations. Later on, I moved one point to a different location in my home, further away from a specific Ring camera. After moving the point further away, the Ring camera stayed connected to that point even though there is one closer to the camera. Apparently this isn\u2019t an issue, because the camera still shows a good WiFi signal."}

However, having been through a few routers in the last few years with disappointing results, I had to write how ecstatic I am with Google's WiFi mesh router system. It's not the whole-home coverage - any mesh system of this price should pull that off. It's the interface and the parental controls. I can easily see every device on my network at any time from my phone. Better yet, I can see how much Internet bandwidth (though not network throughput) each device is using - and pause any device at-will. I can also prioritize bandwidth usage, giving priority to, say, the 4k Amazon program we're watching over the YouTube video my son is. The parental controls are the best I've come across. I can set up groups of devices and put them on schedules - and can pause those schedules if I need to. The little mesh pods even look good!\n\nI suppose I could wish for more granular control over the firewall, and I do wish I could measure actual network throughput - not just Internet usage. But really, I don't require the more granular firewall control and throughput would be useful for troubleshooting. I haven't had any troubles though. So maybe I don't need the feature to fix the problem that I'm not having. The only real ding I have is the single ethernet port on each module. It seems unreasonable to expect owners of this system to only need one wired connection to the router. A small gigabit switch handily solves the problem, but for $300 I'd like a few more ports.\n\nAll told, I can't imagine being this excited, this pleased by a router. Yet here I am.

I was done setting up all 3 routers in less than 15 minutes. Google goes out of their way to make sure you know exactly what you are doing every step of the setup (they even explain what a modem is).\n\nI initially got the Google Wifi system to combat a problem I was having with my ISP Issued router. I live in a 2000+ sqft home with an open floor plan. Recently, I had begun adding a bunch of smart devices around the house (switches, smart lock, Amazon Echo (3), smart plugs, etc...). When you couple all those new smart devices with phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, etc... already in the house, I had over 20 devices connected to 1 WiFi Access Point!\n\nWhat ended up happening was that, although the signal was good in every room, the WiFi connection would randomly drop or I would get an IP Configuration Error on one of the devices. It seems as though all of the device signals were overlapping and causing the bottle neck to be at the access point. I was able to prove this by confirming that the closer I got to the router the more reliable the connection got even without a noticeable change in signal strength.\n\nGoogle Wifi solves this problem by allowing me to setup the mesh network to blanket the entire home. I can now move room to room and my devices automatically connect to the Google Router with the best connection. All while using the same SSID seamlessly. Unlike an extender, which requires you to setup the extender using a different SSID and forces devices to have to drop its previous connection to connect to the new SSID, Google Wifi allows you to use the same SSID for all of its routers.\n\nGoogle Wifi is smart enough to distinguish which devices should use 2.4 GHz and which should use 5.0 GHz. This now also eliminates the need to manage 2 sets of SSIDs. When managing so many devices it is hard to keep up with which require 2.4 GHz which require 5.0 GHz, each with its own SSID. Google Wifi lets you setup one SSID and it allows the device to connect using its default frequency.\n\nAll of this is managed from an app on your phone, so you no longer need to worry about navigating to 192.168.0.1 or 10.0.0.1, and remembering the default username and password. Google Wifi is linked to your Google account, you can add multiple admins, and manage your network via an app and manage the network remotely.\n\nGoogle took a usually complicated concept like mesh networking and made it work and easy to setup.\n\nThe entire thing was super easy to setup and solved the problem I was having.\nSuper happy with this purchase!"}

It was inexpensive, easy to set up, and the app was easy to use and configure, although it was relatively simplistic and lacked some features I was hoping for (such as very limited content filtering). Worse, one of the three units failed to connect to the mesh network. I spent nearly five exhausting hours with Google phone support trying to troubleshoot (including resetting, uploading system log files, various router configuration changes, etc.), but they refused to admit there was anything wrong with it. I finally lost my patience and returned it to Amazon. ***\n\nSecond up was the Orbi. This was significantly more expensive, so I opted for the two-pack (which Netgear claims should be powerful enough for a 5000 sq ft house (mine's around 4500). The devices are gigantic, suggesting serious hardware, but they're not unattractive, and were likewise easy to set up. Performance was pretty good, although I found a few corners of the house where signals were still weak. However...controlling this network was a huge pain. The Orbi app itself is fairly anemic. I ended up downloading their Genie app (which their own website isn't even clear about whether it supports the Orbi); it works and offers a lot of customization options, but is fairly low-level and much more technically-oriented than the more consumer-friendly Google Wifi. Setting up parental controls and bed-time schedules, for example, was very awkward and limited. My house also has ethernet wiring, and even the most recent firmware updates didn't seem to allow ethernet backhaul to work. Realizing I probably spent a lot of money buying (dedicated radio backhaul) hardware I was trying in vain to work around anyway, I returned it. ***\n\nLast was the Deco M5. It was the cheapest of the three, offered easy hardware setup and configuration, a clean app with more features than the Google Wifi, and painless ethernet backhaul. Wifi performance seems strong throughout the house (I have one unit on each of our three floors). The only downside is that there's no web access (though with the app you can get to it remotely). By the way: Some reviews say there's no \"access point\" mode on the M5; the current firmware/app do indeed offer a switch between router and AP modes. This was by far the best choice for me. *****"}

My previous setup consisted of a Trendnet router, a Securifi extender, and a TP-Link extender. Wireless performance was erratic, particularly with the Securifi, which required rebooting a couple of times a week to regain access to wireless devices that had linked to it. Google's system was a simple drop in to replace all three. It does require using a smart phone app for the initial set up (Android in my case). I have to say the app is truly excellent, and has a number of nifty features for testing mesh performance. I was tempted to just blast through the installation, but decided to actually follow the step by step directions to make sure I didn't overlook anything. The app is really easy to use, although a bit drawn out as the app checks repeatedly to determine the setup is going according to Hoyle. Whoever wrote it has a great grasp of how to keep an average user from getting confused. You simply plug in and hook up one of units to your modem, then install the app (it won't install until there is a unit for it to find). That becomes your primary unit. Once it is set up, the app asks if you have additional units and moves on to guide you through establishing them as satellites. You have some neat checks you then run to see how well everything is working (and if you are getting the speed your ISP is promising).\n\nThe only criticism I have is that the units only have 2 ethernet ports, which meant I had to add an ethernet switch to the primary unit to be able to use the cable connections from 2 nearby computers and a VOIP (Ooma) box, a minor quibble since a good 5 port ethernet switch is less than $20.\n\nI'm hoping my days of seeing wifi failing while out of town are over. So far the Google mesh system performance is fantastic ... if it doesn't stay that way I'll revisit this review."}

I like the Linksys new velop, but if you are looking to spend less than $300, then this is a decent route to go. I have 3000 sq footage house with decent signal however velop works better in blocked spaces where google wifi will lose its signal if you put it in a store etc. I wish it had more Ethernet points, however, you can purchase cheap with TP-LINK Ethernet adapter. Overall its good. Works with Fiber Optic also and compatible with Nest, Abode products. Did YOUTUBE video on it."}

I only replaced it because I had a couple of further away IOT devices that struggled just a little (for instance my side door Ring door bell was getting WIFI but lower quality).\n\nWhen I first installed the first 3 pucks I was impressed. It worked. Admittedly 2 were wired in perfect locations and covered most of my house at very high speed. However, after noticing some of the IP addresses were still coming up from the DHCP server from my AT&T Uverse router, I call Google who confirmed I HAD to wire the ethernet directly to the primary GWIFI puck. The AT&T router is in a cupboard in the basement but since I had 5 more GWIFI devices, I wasn't that worried. However, now my TV's wouldn't work consistently, even though wired via ethernet back to the primary puck and directly into the AT&T router as instructed. A call to Google confirmed that GWIFI doesn't support AT&T Uverse cable boxes. AGHH!! Something to do with AT&T using a different method that \"Google overlooked\" in the design/development. OK, so now I was forced to use 2 of my main hardwired locations for the TV and 3 of the GFI pucks in my main location now had to be wireless (a true mesh (GWIFI to GWIFI).\n\nNow the fun starts. Even 20 ft away, in line of site I couldn't always get a good Mesh. I am convinced I know why. The design of the mesh is flawed. The idea that you have to tell the Mesh you've moved a GWIFI puck should be a clue. It doesn't always know what the best device to connect to is. I had 3 pucks in a line and my Note 8 phone got a 300MBS download by connecting to the puck in the middle. However, puck closest to my phone was showing \"weak\" to \"zero\". If I moved the puck to get STRONG and moved it back, I could go 3 or 4 hours of STRONG but then, it would go back to weak - which convinces me it had connected to the furtherst away puck rather than a nearer hardwired one.\n\nI know it was all configured correctly because I could get it all to work for a few hours and them, for whatever reason, 2 of the main devices were weak.\n\nGoogle, you still have a lot to do. Not showing which puck each other puck was connected to and now allowing \"advanced\" techs to play with it and lock it in is a problem. Either get your software right to pick up the right puck or let me do it.\n\nI persevered for 4 days and am returning all 6 pucks until Google figures this out. I tried, I really did."}

Let me explain why.\n\nNow I love the way these work once they are in and setup. They are positively one of the\nbest wifi units I think you can add. They use basically a Manet network, the idea (for all\nyou non-network folks and maybe even some that have never heard the term) is that\nmultiple units will all appear as the same wifi network. One acts as the base where the internet\nis (the central unit) and the others relay packets to the internet point. This means you can have them chained\nfrom A -> B -> C----->network\n\nThis absolutely is terrific and will make your wifi work 10x or more better. One of these I set\nyou could get no service out on the patio with a traditional wifi (you might just see the network\nbut could never attach) but with 3 of these setup right.. poof I get all 50meg down on the patio.\n\nNow why did I not rate this 5 stars then?\n\nWell two things:\n\n1) The manual/setup talks about how that if you want, you can connect the \"non-central\" wifi\nunits to a wired connection for better performance. Why would you want to do this? Well\nif you have to set two of these just a bit too far apart, but you happen to have a hard wired\nconnection, then they can pass off packets over the wire making the distance evaporate. This\nworks fine with one hitch. You have to power the unit up and get it in service *before* you plug\nit in to the wired network. Ok so you do that.. and it seems to be working.. but then the power blinks\noff and on.. now you have to go back to the unit and unplug it from the wall and cat 5.. and then plug\nit back in to power.. wait for it to come up.. and then plug it in to the cat 5. This is a total pain.. which means\nyou basically can't use that feature if you don't want to march out to where you have these things everytime\nthe power blinks out.\n\n2) The third unit of these I setup had difficulties. I put them in a room together and got them all linked together\n(or tried to). And one no matter what kept saying \"you are too far from the other unit\".. but it was 6 inches away!\nI called google support. They walked me through factory reseting all of them (there is a button on the side you hold\ndown through the power up) and re-linking them... no avail. Finally they wanted to get measurements so they could\ndebug the problem (I understand I am a software developer).. so I helped them twice get data from my app once then\nand again when they contacted me by email two days later. They were going to get back to me.. 1 month later nothing...\nI call them they said they will contact me.. 1 week later nothing. Finally I decided to buy a 4th unit and then send the\nbad one back. When the 4th unit arrived I brought all the units together and factory reset them.. then used a different\none as a base unit. .. my problem went away.. all 4 units came online and are working.. so great I have\neven better coverage. But still a bit better service from google would be welcome..\n\nNow another trick you can do with the remote units ... assuming they are not wired to anything to pass packets back\n(as I describe above that makes no sense to due to power cycle issues), you can hook a device to a remote unit's\nnetwork jack (there are two of them) and have it use the network.. This is great for things that don't understand wifi..\n\nOverall I like them.. and my big issue (the power cycle cable) I am sure will be fixed with a software update at\nsome point. The customer service... well they were nice when I talked to them but they could have at least\nsaid.. hey its been 3 weeks and we don't know when we will figure it out or something... gesh..\n\nUpdate 2/19/18\n\nSo I finally called Google support and spoke to them about my issue. Turns out that its \"not\"\na software bug, but a feature :o\n\nSo basically you *can* link a remote google wifi with your main one, its just you can't do\nit over your lan. So what does this mean? Well there are two ethernet plugs on each\ngoogle wifi point. One has a little world by it the other does not. On one of your points\nyou link as the \"main\" access point. You hook the cable from your ISP/Router into the\nworld on that one. All the rest you normally do *not* hook up. However if you have one\nthat is \"far away\" from your \"main\" access point, you hook it up by taking the other\nport off your \"main\" access point and run a separate cable/network over to your\nremote one. So it would look something like this (forgive the horrible ascii drawing)\n\nRouter <----network---> port 1-Main-Wifi-point- port2 ---<other network>-- Remote-Wifi-point\n\nThe idea here is that the Remote-Wifi-point has to get its IP-Address from your Main-Wifi point.\nIf you, like me have the following drawing:\n\nRouter <------+---network----------> port 1-Main-Wifi-point\n|\n|\n+--------> Remote-Wifi-point\n\nSince my house network runs in multiple rooms, its not going to\nwork because the Remote-Wifi-point gets its IP address from\nmy Router.. it can't see whatever broadcasts and other fun\nare going on behind the \"Main\" wifi point.\n\nNow this is rather a pain since, if you like me, don't have multiple\nethernet networks in your house and have only one its pretty well\nnear impossible to run a cable from the main wifi-point (in the kitchen\nin my case) all the way over to the remote one (in the art studio).\n\nSo what am I going to do to fix it? Well I think the only chance I have\nis to setup a power line network. I have purchased a couple of pairs\nof the TP-Link AV-2000 2-Port Gigabit pass through power line\nsets. I have one setup in my office now so I can get a ethernet \"wired\"\nconnection. How these critters work is you plug them into two outlets\nand press a pair button on each. They talk over the standard power\nlines and form a network. If they are on the same circuit (like they are\nwhen you usually pair them) they can get up to 1Gbps between them. However\nthe reality of it is you won't get that. I can get 70Mbps only and thats after\nmoving them around.. I put the main one next to my router and have one\nin the office... Now you can build multiple networks (or so the box claims).\nSo I will probably put a power line network where my Main wifi point is\nand then pair one out with my other google wifi point. That should in\ntheory create a second lan that may only get 30 or 40Mbps but at least\nthe wifi will become one seamless network and my \"weak point\" in the\nnetwork will no longer be weak.\n\nOf course my bride already does not like the wifi point in the kitchen\neven though I mounted it up high and put the wires in a cable\nrun... so I may have to change where the main wifi point is.. which\nof course may cause even further issues.. sigh. Networking is\nso much fun :)"}

{"Author": "Phil in Magnolia", "Date": "on December 21, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Easy Set-Up and Great Flexibility", "Text": "After almost ten years of satisfactory service from my 2nd generation Apple Airport Extreme, it was time for me to upgrade my home wifi network to a more modern system. I did some research on the various alternatives and selected this Google system based upon articles and reviews I read, and with the expectation that it would be easy to set up and manage. I do not require great sophistication in my wifi system and I don't intend to be manually changing settings. I simply want something that works and is reliable.\n\nEverything was set up using the app on my iPhone. This is one minor thing I was initially not enthusiastic about with this Google wifi, because it can't be managed from your computer, it can only be managed from a phone (or I suppose tablet) app. Downloading the app was therefore the first step, and it connected to my Google account immediately.\n\nThe instructions provided with the equipment are about as minimal as you can imagine - 1) plug in the first wifi point, and 2) download the app and follow the instructions. Nothing else is provided (or, as it turns out, necessary).\n\nSetup was straightforward although it took a call to my internet provider to reset their modem before the Google wifi would finally complete the setup and connect to the internet properly. The nice thing is that at all times the app provided clear and easy to understand instructions, including recommending contacting my internet provider (and what to say to them) when the standard setup was not successful (and I went through it twice, unplugging both the modem and the wifi router each time and for the specified lengths of time).\n\nOnce fully setup, the app automatically downloaded the latest software from Google and reset itself, taking perhaps 5 minutes altogether. No action on my part was required.\n\nI now have a mesh setup using the three Google devices covering my home, and to my great satisfaction the download speed from my internet provider is over 100 Mbps, better than I was able to achieve using my old Apple router (which had been delivering 60 Mbps, still not shabby).\n\nOne key thing that I now have is the ability to set up guest access, not possible with my previous router. I also have 802.11a/b/g/n/ac supported, the latest IEEE specification for wireless systems that is currently available.\n\nThe only downside I've found so far is that I'm unable to connect my Anova Culinary Sous Vide Precision Cooker to the Google wifi network, because the Anova cooker will only connect to a 2.4 GHz band, and the Google wifi (only) creates a single network that uses both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands and doesn't provide the capability to separate the bands (much troubleshooting with the assistance of Anova tech support led to this conclusion).\n\nThe app has lots of features that I've only partially explored at this point, but so far it is straightforward to understand and use, and the information provided is comprehensive, for example:\n\n- you can see exactly which devices are connected to your network and how much bandwidth they are using, in real time\n- you can prioritize devices in order to give preference to one over another, for example if you are streaming video\n- you can test your system and separately see what the internet connection speed is, how well each wifi mesh point is connecting, and how strong the wifi signal is to the device you are controlling the system from (most likely your cell phone)\n- you can see the connection details for each device, what the IP and MAC addresses are for each, and whether or not each is using 2.4 GHz or 5.0 GHz\n\nI'm very satisfied with this system and looking forward to reliable service in the future."}

Coverage isn't great in some spots, or no coverage at all. Look no further. After doing an extensive amount of research, this solution appeared to be the best. I have to say that for sure this is a great solution. First let's start with how they look. Relatively small,and a nice round shape with a white color, the units blend right in. There is a glowing light ring in the center which I found a bit annoying in my bedroom but quickly discovered you can adjust the brightness or even turn it off completely. SCORE! I purchased wall mounts for them (Myriann Wall Mount Holder Wall Mount Stand Ceiling Bracket (3 Pack)For Google Wifi) so they are up on the wall and hardly noticeable. Next is setup. This could not be easier. While I am a bit techy, you really don't need to be. You connect to your existing WiFi router (mine is FiOS) download the Google WiFi app and just follow the instructions. I have 3 units. The main one is in my office in a downstairs area not near much (probably why my WiFi suffered in the first place). Then you basically just plug the other units in, scan the barcode on the bottom, and the app does the rest. I turned off the FiOS WiFi so there wouldn't be any issues switching between the Google WiFi and FiOS. I have a 2200 sq ft home and have 3 units. Lastly is performance. WOW. Just WOW. Every inch of my home is covered as well as a decent distance around the outside. The mesh network doesn't drop, the speed is consistent, and I'm getting close to the 1Gb I pay for (have tested around 900Mb). In addition to the absolutely amazing and simple set up and performance, there are some features on the app that some of you may love. One being - you can identify your kids devices or any device that connects to the WiFi network and you can \"pause\" their connection. Yup = if you go to sleep, you can shut down your kids WiFi access. Any or even all devices. Eating dinner? Shut 'em down! Also for you with young kids, you can restrict known adult sites as well. If your kids are streaming video and you want to prioritize your device, you can do that too. Some really cool features. I am so happy I made this purchase and highly recommend it for ease of use, performance, and some cool features. Control it all from your mobile device too. Just a great job Google!"}

I read the router could be the problem, so I bit the bullet and ordered this.\n\nI just LOVE how easy this was to set up. Our house is a 1400sf L shape, with the kitchen and dining on the short side of the L and the bedrooms on the long side. We have the router in the living room where the cable modem and Ooma router are, in the corner of the L. I was worried that the signal would not reach my room, which is the farthest, but I usually get the FULL signal there. It literally took me five minutes to set it all up.\n\nNow all of our devices are working well and I LOVE that I can shut off the wifi to devices individually (hello TEEN and PRETEEN children!) and have a separate Wifi signal for guests without having to give any passwords (the app handles it).

The next two which were relatively in series and one further from the next made connections just fine to the main hub however the final hub which needed to be located on the exact opposite end of the house had a poor connection (to the main hub) despite it. It being all that far from the nearest \u201cextender\u201d hub. I had hoped that the extender hubs could mesh together and communicate to the main hub via the extenders but this is not the case. I think I will be looking at the Ubiquiti enterprise class access points instead."}

Enjoying speeds over 800 Mbps on either net. Learned Google WiFi is capped at just over 200 Mbps for Wifi with this router.\nRecent update:\nI dumped the configuration in my previous update. I run this router wired to my ISP router.\n1st, I find that any time I change ISP router configuration items, I have to manually UNPLUG and RE-PLUG the power on this Google unit in order to restart. This appears true even if none of the configuration changes on my ISP router have anything to do with this Google router (example: adding a local device to reserved DHCP on my ISP router)\n2nd, I MESH a second google unit because the coverage is horrid from this 1st unit. It barely reaches through my wood floors or wood finished rec room. The 2nd unit often has problems connecting to the first. Getting a second unit to connect is PAINFUL. I found however that once done, even if the second unit disconnects, leave it alone a while (hours to days?) and it will recover itself.\n\n3rd, lots of wrong or false messages from the google app. \"Oops, something is wrong\" but followed by \"Everything looks good\". Which is it? NO CREDIBILITY.\n\n4th, NO WAY to backup , let alone restore, a configuration. Good luck if something gets hosed. START AGAIN, DO NOT PASS GO. DO NOT COLLECT ANYTHING BUT GRIEF AND PAIN.\n\nPrevious update:\n\nUsing the newer 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac technology, the AC mode reaches fairly well, but not perfectly in my older home. I am running the Google WiFi system wired into my existing Apple AirPort router, positioned in the basement ceiling so that the 1st-floor bedrooms have coverage where my Apple AirPort could not reach very well. Interesting that I have read reviews its range is not as good as other 802.11 /AC units as a single unit wifi point.\n\nI purchased a second unit and out of the box, it would not mesh - the single primary reason most people would buy this unit. With over an hour of google support on this device, we could prove the unit itself worked as a 2nd primary router, but neither unit would join the other network. Google has some way you can put in a code and they can spy on your unit, but you cannot access logs directly it seems.\n\nSadly, the Google unit can only be configured through a phone app and not by directly connecting to the WiFi point via IP. The configuration choices are VERY LIMITED. Supposedly good in multiple units as a network for a huge home, IF you can make it work, it's only OK as a single unit for a smaller home. Might want to look at other products for a small buildings on a larger land lots.\n\nAt the premium price point for a 1st unit and no discount on a second (though you can buy 3 at discount) I will never buy a third. I will however put these up for sale on eBay and buy some decent tech. As my home is under 1000 sq ft though I have a large land property, I would love to have the coverage outside, or in the detached garage."}

It works so well, all my wifi devices that had spotty connections at best are full blown speed now. And it is so easy to set up.

I'm at work now, and you can even see the connected devices and admin the router settings when away from the house! Setting up forwards and reserved IP addresses is a breeze (if you care about that sort of thing). This is amazing!!

The packaging was well put together carefully, the power cords and an ethernet cable was packed inside the boxes along with the power cords.\n2. The set up and placement were incredible, although I did have a little trouble understanding setting up the 2nd WiFi point but after reading it carefully, it became easier. All I need to do was to follow the direction via the Google WiFi app, by the way, the app is available only through App Store (for iOS) and Google Play (for Android). The whole setup minutes were not literally 10 minutes, it may take somewhat between 20-30 minutes for me.\n3. The speed on this thing was amazing, but it doesn't have raw speed performance as another well-known brand company but it does its job. I was able to test the mesh quality between all three WiFi Points, all I'm getting was \"GREAT\". It's amazing how now the dual band has become ONE. So this means, if you set up SSID and password, it works for BOTH 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz bands. All of my devices were able to connect to it from my devices that only operate on 2.4Ghz to the devices that works on 5Ghz, it works great and flawlessly.\n4. The overall experience for this was astounding, I could literally walk around in my house without Wifi signal dropping, changing, or error notification. I get WiFi EVERYWHERE.\nFew things to know about this product: this products have been updated and now featured some of the advanced settings such as DHCP IP reserveations, IPv6, Port Forwarding, DNS, WAN for DHCP, Static IP, and PPPoE, UPnP, and that's just about it. With the recent update that have been released within the last couple of weeks, the performance on Google Wifi has become better as ever. It's incredible!"}

The WiFi signal on this device is not good. I have tried improving the situation by using wired access points and wifi extenders but nothing really worked well especially when 'roaming' around the house using wifi calling. I purchased the Google WiFi 3 node system. It was easy to setup and worked very well. Where I might have had 2-3mbps I now had 50mbps. Close to the nodes I get 112mbps (the max my internet connection provides). So for a simple expandable wifi system this is excellent. However I can only give it 4 stars because it has no real support for bridge mode. Why do we care? So I have a laserjet printer and iTunes library that are connected to my wired network. Without bridge mode, wireless devices cannot 'see' devices on the wired network. So no printing or watching iTunes content from iPads and iPhones. There is a workaround that an excellent Google support technician gave me and that is to route my entire wired network through the primary google node. That would work BUT I use port forwarding through the Netgear router and I would then also need to configure port forwarding on the Google Wifi network. This is becoming a maintenance headache... So for simple wifi coverage in a big house this is great but it is not friendly with legacy network devices. I have switched to a Linksys Velop system which is not as pretty and slow to setup but it does support a proper bridge mode across multiple nodes and I'm actually seeing faster connections further from the nodes too."}

My initial thought was to just get a wifi extender. I was so glad when my cousin told me about the Google Mesh system. This set of 3 was cheaper than the router. Adding a wifi extender would have been another $100-$150ish or so. The Google wifi was super easy to setup and now I get internet throughout my house. 3 pieces was enough to cover my office, upstairs, master bedroom, and even the very far end of my backyard.\n\nI also read that the google wifi system would sacrifice internet speed. I believe this is only true of you are running a gigabyte fiberoptic or something that will give you about 700 download. My internet maxes at 300 download. The google wifi and the Asus router both gave me the same ups and download speed.\nIf you are on an average internet plan, (100-150mpbs), you will not suffer any internet speed at all."}

I thought both are Google products, they will work together - but Chromecast 1st Gen is only 2.4 and so I hoped to hard wire it. To do that, I would lose the port and wouldn't be able to cast, as both devices must be on the same network (either wifi or LAN).\nOtherwise, it works good on wifi, but more than half price routers do that also.

I pay for 220 megabit internet speed and I was getting 180 out of the linksys router with the computer near the router and slightly slower speeds in other parts of the house. However, after setting up the Google system, base unit with two satellites, the max speed of the base unit next to the modem was 150 on average and the satellite units between 20 and 40 megabits. I spent hours, literally, talking to Google tech support over weeks and no matter what they asked me to do it didn't improve the speeds, particularly those of the satellite units. Their main solution was asking me to move the satellite units around the house, which I did multiple times with no improvement in speeds at all. In the end I've uninstalled the Google system and went back to Linksys. After all of the trial and error and the huge amount of time spent on my part with tech support I was told that Google wouldn't offer a refund or a replacement although the low speeds were verified by them, I'm stuck with a worthless system. I'd try to sell it but I wouldn't want to stick anyone else with the headaches I had with it!!!!"}

{"Author": "Mark Rogers", "Date": "on November 22, 2017", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A Very Good WiFi Mesh Network Solution- and Why I Returned Mine", "Text": "I wanted better/faster wifi throughout our 2800 square-foot home (which I wired for ethernet years ago- before there was reliable wifi). We have a 100 mbps Verizon FIOS service with their Quantum Gateway Router on the 2nd floor at one end of the house. The ethernet connections were awesome, but the WiFi connections were much slower and spottier. I like Google products and heard great things about this set, so I tried it out.\n\nThe units themselves are very nice looking, and connecting them was a breeze using the phone app. The wifi coverage was certainly improved and the signal strength was very good in most places in our home.\n\nThe problems came when trying to connect some of our peripheral devices- IP cameras, printers, a TV and a few others- which refused to connect. I spent some time researching and troubleshooting, but the Amcrest IP cameras, whose back-up connectivity troubleshooting required an ethernet connection, seemed nearly impossible to configure on the Google WiFi network.\n\nIt is important to understand that Google WiFi creates its own network- separate from your original, ethernet network. So devices hooked-up to the Google WiFi network can't be seen via the Verizon Router interface, and vice-versa. This causes big problems with some devices that are difficult to connect to the Google WiFi network, but worked fine on the original WiFi and ethernet network. There were some things that could be done by reading, hacking around, changing device and network settings, etc. But it became very time-consuming and a PITA just to get some devices- which ran fine on the old network- to connect at all to the new network. And if you think my situation is an isolated incident, check the Google WiFi public help forum, or Google something like \"can't connect printer to Google WiFi\". There are a huge number of people with problems- many worse than what I had.\n\nI finally decided that the troubleshooting and reconfiguring was more trouble than it was worth and returned the Google Devices. I replaced them with 2 Verizon-branded Actiontec Wireless Network Extenders (see link in the comments to this review). The Actiontec Extenders simply connect via Ethernet to your existing network (there's also a MoCA connection that costs a little more and allows you to connect via your coaxial cable wiring if you don't have ethernet where you want to put the extenders) and then act as access points to the existing network. They required zero configuration, nothing had to be re-connected or re-configured as they are simply an extension of what we already had. The WiFi improvement was even better than what the Google WiFi Mesh solution had provided, and it was about $100 cheaper to add 2 extenders instead of the 3-unit Google WiFi units.\n\nSo while I think the Google WiFi is very good, it is best for people with simpler needs. If all you have are some smart phones and laptops and maybe a Smart TV, Google WiFi will probably work fine for you and provide an elegant improvement to your WiFi network. But if you have lots of other devices like cameras, printers, locks, thermostats, smoke detectors, or other smart home devices that use WiFi connections, you may find yourself frustrated and bleary-eyed trying to get them working with Google WiFi.\n\nAnd if you have Verizon FIOS and some ethernet or coax wiring already in place, I strongly suggest saving money and heaps of time simply adding an Actiontec Extender or two (or the Verizon-branded version of the same units).\n\nNo doubt Google will improve their solution and it will be better and easier to work with in the future, but for now, if you have lots of different types of devices to connect, be aware that you may be in for hours of troubleshooting...."}

If you are trying to not reconfigure a bunch of static IP devices from another network (say from 192.168.1.XXX), good luck. Also, you cannot use these guys in bridge mode if you want to have a mesh network. They just turn off the feature when you switch to bridge mode.

The Quantum router they provide performs very good when using the wired cat 5/6 LAN connection. However the Quantum router's wifi connection isn't very good at all. Unless you are in the same room with the router the speed and range of the router is less than mediocre. I stream a lot of movies, TV shows and YouTube videos but I can only watch them in the living room (where Verizon's Quantum router is located) if I am to watch without buffering and/or loss of signal to devices located elsewhere in the house. I did a lot of research on my options as to weather I should get Verizon's Quantum network extender or a second router to put in the opposite side of the house where there is little to no signal. I came across these Google WiFi mesh routers. I probably read all of the customer reviews on these routers and for the most part I was very impressed with the customer reviews. I paid a little more than I wanted to ($250 +) to improve the wireless network network in my home. However, if I was to put more money in my wifi network then I wanted it to meet my expectations on how a wireless network should operate and that is to have a strong, fast and dependable network signal in every corner in my home. That is exactly what these Google WiFi routers gave me. To be honest, one of these wifi routers would have meet my expectations, but the two additional mesh routers gives me a strong connection almost covering my entire cul-de-sac. This means I can stream music from my wifi network instead of my mobile network when listening to music while grilling in my backyard or cleaning/detaling my vehicles in my driveway. I would never have been able to do these things before purchasing the Google WiFi mesh routers. Ultimately, if you are looking to enhance and extend your Wi-Fi network, then from my experience these are the routers that will that and more. I highly recommend this Google mesh Wi-Fi network."}

It\u2019s worked out very well in the two months we\u2019ve been using this system. First, the signal strength is excellent, so much so that even though I bought a three-pack for their 3,000-sq ft one-story home, installing just one unit provided very good coverage and signal strength throughout the house, and so I sold the other two. The connection has been very stable the entire time, requiring no reboots, and speed and signal strength are vastly improved over the previous router. The other big advantage is the ease of use of the app, which makes it easy to see which devices are using bandwidth and even for the manager of the network to reset the system from another iOS or Android device with the Google Wifi app (which only needs to be connected to the internet, not necessarily to this wifi network). So, for example, if my parents complain their wifi is slow (hasn\u2019t happened yet with this system!), I can perform a speed test in the app to determine if the internet connection itself is working, and if so what other problems might be causing the apparent slowdown - e.g., a Chromecast device that they forgot to disconnect from and is still using up bandwidth. Google Wifi isn\u2019t the first system to bring these features to a wifi router, but it does it in a very convenient, expandable, and affordable package, and so for the 99% of users that don\u2019t need certain highly specific networking features (if you don\u2019t know what those are, then you probably don\u2019t need them!), this is a great choice."}

{"Author": "MJohns", "Date": "on November 15, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A Seriously Disappointing Decision.", "Text": "It is difficult to write a review on this product by itself, since it was only a part of my overall purchase of 4 Google Homes, 2 Google WiFi and an ASUS Google Hub. The purchase was made with the idea of replacing my Amazon Echo products and enhancing my home and home office and making my life easier and more efficient. It was my hope to 1) have music that I could listen to throughout the house 2) walk from one room to another and have the same music playing, 3) be able to make calendar appointments using my Google Home, 4) have Google Home Assistant read my calendar 5) and email, 6) and be able to talk to those in other rooms throughout my house as though I had an intercom. Not only had I been using Google Assistant on my phone,and loved the way it worked and the information I could readily obtain, I wanted the added features that I mentioned above. I expect that would be easy since the current system I have in my home office is the Amazon Echo Show, Amazon Echo, and Amazon Dot. It was my thoughts that surely Google could do all of that, and do it better. Boy, was that a mistaken assumption. Even though I had been led to believe I could do that, truth and reality came crashing in.\n\nSo, after spending hundreds of dollars to \u2018concert\u2019 from Amazon Echo to the Google Wifi and Google Home, what I found out is that Google Home can only read my calendar and email if they are a standard gmail account. That means that even though my accounts are all gmail business accounts (Google+ and GSuite accounts), the Google Home cannot access my Google accounts because they are Google+ or GSuite accounts. Bottom line; Google Home cannot access Google calendar or Google email. They cannot read them, nor write to them. Google Technical supports told me,\u201d We are aware of the problem and are working on it. Our apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.\u201d. Google Home has been out for over 6 months! Google is \u2018aware of the problem\u2019 and they still haven\u2019t fixed it.\n\nHere is the part that is even more frustrating. My Amazon Echo and Echo Dot CAN access my Google Calendar and Google email and read them to me. I can schedule appointments on my Google calendar using my Amazon Echo and Echo Dot, and I have an Amazon Echo Show that allows me to have video conferences with my customers and colleagues.\n\nI can also upload the playlists from my computer to Amazon Music and play the music back in all, selected zones, or only one room in my house. I cannot do that with Google. I can only listen to music from my Spotify account (which was one of the worst investments I have made, surpassed only by my Google Home conversion investment).\n\nThis is not meant to be an advertisement for Amazon Echo. It is meant to be expression of frustration, disappoint and befuddlement, and a warning to others, that Google Home will not talk to other Google applications and will not enhance your business productivity needs or desires.\n\nIf all you want is tomorrow\u2019s weather, the sum of 4 + 8, and the latest news headlines, then Google Home will meet your needs. But if you are looking for help in business efficiency, listening to music that you already own and have on your PC playlists, or need to calendar your activities using a Voice Assistant, have your daily schedule or daily briefing read back to you, play the same music throughout each room of your home, etc, then you need to wait another year or so for Google to figure out how they can get their own products and applications to talk to each other. Or, if you are like me, and are pretty engrained in using Google email and calendaring, you can use Amazon Echo products to access your Google information until Google finally straightens this conundrum out."}

Before installing the Google Wifi System, we tested our Wifi signal via the Speedtest app in various places throughout our home (Terrace Level, Main Level, Master Bedroom on the 2nd floor, and an Office and Bedroom on the 3rd floor). On the two upper levels, we were only getting speeds of 18 - 20 MB/s. That's \"okay\" by most standards, but it wasn't the speed we were paying for from Comcast (150 MB/s). So we installed Google Wifi (the setup was a breeze!!) and retested our speeds. To our delight, we're now getting average speeds of 147 MB/s throughout the entire home, and easily achieve speeds of 170 MB/s+ on our main level. This is EXACTLY what we had hoped for.

With two kids, the tablet, laptop, Directv, gaming, phone wifi signals were weak in spots but we all made it work. The breaking point was the integration of some Samsung Smartcams into the network. Performance of these devices, depending on where they were placed was spotty and marginally unreliable. My (4 year old) Linksys router simply couldn't handle the load any longer. I did a little research and decided a mesh system would fit my needs best. I considered a wifi extender/booster due to the lower cost but finally bit the bullet and invested in Google WiFi. Google was my choice because it was a little less expensive than the major competitors and I didn't need some of the more advanced features of some of the other systems. Based on the other reviews which detailed pros/cons here, it would do everything I needed it to do. Then came installation.\n\nI consider myself to be fairly technologically competent, but experience has taught me that a job like installing a new network is fraught with unforeseen problems and issues which could result in a lot of frustration and wasted time listening to \"hold\" music on help lines. I planned a full day. Bottom line: After install, I had seven and a half hours of free time after a fast, clear, and effective install. Thank you Google! I started with the quick install card included with the product. Two steps: unpack the box, download and start the companion app on your phone. After shutting down my old router (not without some anxiety), I fired up the app. Within 20 minutes I had the mesh network installed and running all my devices. I could not be happier with the performance throughout my 3800 sq ft house.\n\nOne important note: During the install, you are asked to name your network and provide a security password. Here, I used the same SSID and password I had used on my old router. I did this hoping that my devices would auto-connect to the new network once it was up. It worked. Every single device in the house reconnected to the new network without issue. Had I not used the same SSID/password I would have had to change settings on each of the 16 devices (TVs, gaming, tablets, laptops, phones, Smartthings, Echo devices) in the house. This saved me a lot of time. If for some reason you can't do this, or don't want to, be prepared to spend this additional time."}

I tested the mesh and wifi strength on the app - everything was good for getting a signal. Anyway, it bugged me to no ends that the mesh points were flashing red. I factory reset each mesh point and then I also factory reset the main puck. I set everything up again that morning and everything is working, white lights.\n\nI got home from work and the mesh points are flashing red again. I tried a simple unplug the power, let them sit a few minutes and plug them back in, but still flashing red. Main puck works fine, but the two mesh points are having issues.\n\nI've factory reset all the devices multiple times now and I've setup the Google Wifi mesh pucks multiple times, but I'm always meet with the same results, even if I swap around what puck will be used as the main router. If the mesh points are just left to flash red, eventually after a week or two, they simply stop working with the wifi. I'm about to take this hardware and just pitch it.....well, maybe not just pitch it, but box it back up and reconnect my refurbished ASUS router I got back for the warranty repair.\n\nWhat's the point of having multiple mesh points if they're simply going to fail after a day or less with connecting properly.

Between the router I had and a separate extender my system regularly lost connection and a an IT friend suggested the Google product.\nSetup was a breeze, except for one microcell (cellphone extender) product. I made a call to my wireless telco and through them connected to Google, who promised to work on the problem, and was VERY good in following up. In the meantime, my ISP performed some upgrades and the problem went away. I assume the issue was with the ISP, but who actually knows. Anyway, that one issue was solved, within a day or two.\nIn all other aspects the unit(s) have been flawless. In comparison to my various factory units, my DD-WRT rigs, and separate extenders, the Google product has been quite superior (so far). I love the app for my cellphone (note: you have to use a cell phone to set up the system).\nI have a bit of IT experience, and trying to track down elusive router/ISP issues drives me crazy, especially as my wife has a telecommute contractor position on the other side of the country, and requires a reliable connection. As a photojournalist (semi-retired), so do I.\nI know the Google is not the highest-rated mesh out there, but it is one of the most economical, and so, in my opinion its ease of setup (a real no-brainer), price and reliability make it an excellent choice.

Wifi handover leads to dropped connection.", "Text": "Easy to setup for a regular wireless use-case but not as straight forward to do when connecting the satellite mesh points via Ethernet connected to a switch. When I followed the sparse online guidance for hardwiring satellites one of them never identified it was \u201cwired\u201d and since it was too far from the other points it was offline. Got quick access to call support and after some back and forth they suggested to restore all units to factory settings and then connect the primary point straight to the modem, setup the network wirelessly as usual, and then daisy chain the mesh points directly to the primary point and this worked. After this I could add the switch after the primary access point.\n\nSome other notes:\n- the primary AP needs to be the router (if another router is used and you bridge the Google Wifi the mesh feature is disabled). So for most home use-cases this means that it will sit right by the modem which isn\u2019t ideal if the modem is in a spot where you don\u2019t need great Wifi, eg in the basement.\n- handover between Wifi points leads to dropped connections. So it you eg stream music via a smartphone it will stop when you go out of reach of the first point and switch to the other. Eero and Velop are supposed to handle this better, as should a regular AP like Ubiquiti Unifi"}

Here are the steps for XFinity that I used:\n\n1. Download the Google Wifi App\n2. Open browser on your computer and connect to XFinity WiFi Router and Modem (10.0.0.1) and use the username and password for your device.\n3. On the main page you will see --- Gateway > At a Glance.... you will see Bridge Mode. It is turned off by default. Enable it to turn off the \"Private\" XFinity WiFi for your house and use your own WiFi system. It will take about 90 seconds before WiFi is disabled.\n4. Follow the instructions provided by Google, using the Google Wifi App.\n5. Reconnect all your devices to the new Google WiFi SSID that you setup.\n\nMy WiFi service is so much better using the Google WiFi system. Speeds are topping out on all devices now. I'm still using the XFinity WiFi Router and Modem combo as only a modem now. I do believe the XFinity public network may still but running as I see it in my local list of available connections. I haven't tried to use it however. I also setup a Google WiFi Guest so if folks don't have XFinity as they come to my home, I can provide the password and they can use my separate, guest network using the Google WiFi system.\n\nI did setup priority for my gaming computer during gaming time and I don't know if it had any improvement as it is just me. But other devices will be lower in priority in this case. I am VERY happy I finally bought this setup.\n\nI decided on the 3 pack to have a mesh across the home --- kitchen, main bedroom and the room with the XFinity router / modem. Tests show my home has GREAT coverage now all over. Wherever I go in the house, speed tests are topping out and I have the 100 Mbps plan from XFinity...many times it goes over that.\n\nYou will still need a modem so you can use the one XFinity provides and charges monthly or buy a separate one. For now I'm using the XFinity router / modem in the bridge mode and paying the rental fee. I found in prior years using my own modem, the modem ended up dying a little over a year and thus out of warranty or too much trouble to figure out which device is causing issues to make it worth my time to go back and forth between modem vendor and XFinity."}

We have FIOS internet with a rated 75 Mbps download speed. I have performed speeds checks in multiple locations and the slowest speed was a blazing 65 Mbps. I think that is pretty darn good. We do not have cable, satellite, or even FIOS TV. Everything we do is via internet and have no issues running four (4) TV at once, along with web surfing.

When rebuilding the network, sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't, with the fancy Wifi App telling me I need to contact customer support and my network is bad, which is garbage because i can plug the exact same CAT5 cable in from my modem to any laptop and the internet works just fine. I've been fighting with it for the past hour trying to get it to work again after randomly crashing while watching Netflix. I finally gave up. What a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, one of the three nodes they sent is bad. When i can get it connected to the mesh after a factory reboot, it stays connected for about 15 minutes then crashes to blinking amber. It's done that three times and I can't get it to stay connected no matter where I put it in the house. Thinking it might be a mesh problem, I even tried using it as the Primary hub and it failed there as well. So we have been limping along on 2 nodes for a the past two days until this most recent crash and failure to get it set up and working again, even after factory resetting it all multiple times.\n\nOverall, very disappointed with this. Google usually provides superior products (love my wife's Pixel and my Pixel 2 smart phones) but this Google Wifi setup a blight on their name and more hassle than it's worth."}

Our house was built in the late 70\u2019s so theres More dead spots in our house than I can count. I have tried everything from a more expensive Netgear routers, extenders and even the crap you plug into walls hoping the signal can go though the electricity. None of it worked. I would always get dead spots and \u201cloading\u201d signs on a daily basis. It would almost feel like a conspiracy that during climaxes of great movies or sporting programs, the most important Hail Marys to win the game (if watching on a device) would just so happen to need to \u201cload.......\u201d right when a pivotal moment would happen. Basically I was over it.\n\nFinally got fed up and started doing research the game up on this google Wifi system and this \u201cMesh\u201d network they talk about. Decided at this point I feel like I have tried everything. This product already has great reviews. Figured what do we have to lose?\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nWithin 15 minutes I had the network completely set up and probably the fastest WiFi speed I have ever seen.

This is only the first day I have had this setup.

{"Author": "Somewhat Tech Geek \ud83e\udd13", "Date": "on October 30, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great Speed Improvement, Easy Setup", "Text": "I finally got so fed up with my SurfBoard modem/router coverage in our house that I took the plunge and upgraded to the Google WiFi Mesh Router 3 pack. My biggest problem was slow speeds and spotty coverage from the single router in my \u201coffice\u201d room in our 3500 sq ft home. While I could achieve DL speeds of upto 50+ Mb/s in rooms close to the router, on my office laptop I was getting speeds of 0.15 Mb/s and often my printer would lose connectivity with the laptop. Long story short, after the new install I have great coverage all throughout the house and can get over 100Mb/sec using the Speed Test App on my office laptop. I am a happy camper!\nInstallation: You connect the first node to your modem via an Ethernet cable, download the Google app and follow the installation instructions. Following a firmware update which only takes a few minutes you will be prompted to place the other mesh modes. I placed one in a bedroom on the same floor as the main node and it connected with good/great signal strength. This was a room that would not even get coverage from the existing router. The other node was placed downstairs in the family room adjacent to my office. This part was easy and completed quickly. The next part of the install was a bit more of a challenge. This involved connecting existing devices to the new network.\nInstallation tip. Leave your existing wireless network active until you have transition your devices. Then disable the wifi radio on a combination modem/router or remove the separate router. Devices like iPhones, iPads, tvs, DVD players, satellite boxes, etc. are easily connected to the new network. I also have an alarm system, thermostats and a wireless camera connected to my network. The alarm was easy and the biggest challenge for the thermostats was getting them into wifi setup mode or reregisteing them for remote access. This was an issue specific to these devices and not an issue with the Google router. The camera posed the biggest challenge and hence my tip to leave your existing Network live and transition your devices before killing off your old network.\nOnce all devices were transitioned I found a procedure online to put the SurfBoard into Bridge mode so it would only act as a modem and no longer as a wireless router. My device didn\u2019t behave that well and would no longer communicate after some of the steps, so I ended up just disabling the wifi radio after multiple resets of the device. It\u2019s only been a few days, but so far so good.\nWhy Google wifi? I did the research on the other available mesh networks including eero, orbi and others, but Google was the cheapest. I have no desire to go in and tweak network settings. I. Just want reliable and fast Internet connectivity. If these issues are important to you, then another solution may be more appropriate. By the way the signal strength on my alarm went from one bar to three and now I may upgrade the garage door opener to a wifi model as I can now get a signal there! May also upgrade my stereo in the man cave garageto an network ready model. Just don\u2019t tell my wife!\nShe is also happy as the three \u201chockey puck\u201d or mini \u201cufos\u201d are not too objectionable to the decor!"}

I'm warning you....don't buy this router. I bought one as I had a warranty issue with a Netgear router. (it was fixed and is worth every dime- a software update failed) I didn't want to be without a router so I bought this one. You couldn't get a weaker signal. The single port is plugged into my main Lenovo computer. Wifi is used for a laptop and a phone. When my desktop is on I can barely get a single (the laptop is 2 feet away) and have a hard time opening any browser. I get an error message that indicates my internet connection isn't working properly. Even on my cell phone, I can't open any browser. With the Netgear router I would sometimes upload videos and open another page and read the news, whatever. Forget it with this router, the same error message, the Internet connection is not working. Basically, you can only have one computer working at a time on this piece of junk. I was reading reviews before I bought this router. Google indicates you can have two other units in different rooms to boost the single in larger spaces. What does this tell you? With my Netgear router ($99.00 two years ago) I let my neighbors kids use it ( a condo) and sometimes would have two laptops, a desktop and a phone running at the same time. On all the devices I could do whatever I wanted to do without any drop in signal strength. Google disappointed me with this product. Absolute crap. I'm suspect of any Amazon ratings now. This piece of junk got great reviews. I won't show as a verified purchase as I bought this at Walmart."}

I have 155Mbps RCN service and had tested it many times in the 60Mbps range, sometimes in the 50 and 40 range on my laptop through the airport. Testing right from the modem on my laptop would get 160, 170 Mbps so I was thinking what in the world is wrong? Do I happen to keep testing it at exactly the right time for everything to seem normal? Even at 40Mbps you shouldn't have any troubles streaming but I was. So I thought I will try a new router and after much deliberation decided on the Google wifi router which arrived today. The setup was pretty simple and the app walks you through it. It also walked me through cycling the power of the modem and the router as well because I encountered a connection issue which it said was normal. And guess what... I tested the speed a few times right away and after a few hours now and all times the speeds have been in the upper 180Mbps (187,189,187,186). That's better than I'm supposed to get so I am incredibly happy. I have no need for advanced settings and my apartment is about 750 square feet so one point is perfect. I hope it stays this way but currently this is the best purchase I made this year. Thanks Google and Amazon!"}

However, the one issue I have had is with one of the access points triggering a motion detector on my alarm system creating constant false alarms.\n\nI have had an alarm system for 4 years and never had any issues other than low batteries in wireless sensors. Then about few weeks ago I started having false alarms very often that were triggered by my basement motion detector. I had a alarm tech come over and look over the motion and it's position, it's sensitivity, battery and everything else. He couldn't find anything wrong. In any case he swapped out the motion. Then that night another false alarm. Finally I decided to bypass the motion so I could get some sleep but keep an eye on the history log to see how many times it was being activated. It was being activated quite a lot everyday but with no meaningful pattern. Finally I started searching online for answers and came across a post in a alarm company forum about possible interference between motion detectors and access points or routers. After reading it I realized I had just purchased the google WiFi mesh network a few weeks back. I looked through my logs and emails of false alarms and found the date when this issue began. Then I went and found the receipt so I can see when I purchased the google WiFi mesh system and when it was delivered. I couldn't believe it but the false alarms started the same night when the system was delivered and installed. I went to the basement and saw I had placed one of the access points about 5 feet below and slightly in front of the motion detector. I decided to move it another 5 feet away and check the logs for the next few days. Just like that the issue was gone. Just to be sure I placed the access point back to it's original spot and the issue returned again consistently for 48 hours.\n\nI just want to state I am not saying this issue is specific to the google WiFi system. This could have possibly happened with a regular WiFi router or other WiFi mesh/access point products. I just wanted to post this in case anyone is having similar issues with their alarm system and have nearby WiFi equipment."}

I recently disconnected my Comcast Xfinity modem/router combination because it just didn't work well. I installed an Arris modem and attached this Google Wifi set to it. The modem was simple to set up -- phone Comcast and they will configure it -- and then download the Google Wifi app -- and the instructions are simple. I was up and running flawlessly in 45 minutes (most of it was Comcast doing its thing). We were renting our previous setup at $120/month. This will pay for itself in about two years.\n\nThe coverage at the house is fantastic. I went from a download speed of 15-20 upstairs to 75 immediately. Upload improvement is similar. Each floor gets its own router and the difference is measurable.\n\nFor parents: the best part is that you have full control of your wifi system. So with one click in the app, you can shut down the wifi in your house (like at dinner...). And you can set up a schedule <by device> so that, say, your teenager's wifi goes off at 10PM and restarts at 7AM. It is amazing. This is a smart bit of hardware and well-crafted software. And best of all, it works."}

HINT: look at the bottom of your google wifi before calling customer service if you can't get the google wifi app to detect a connection. chances are, you just need to manually connect to the network that your phone already discovered and the network name/password are on the bottom of your unit. after setting it up, i was amazed. everywhere i walk around in my 2000sqft home was blanketed with 180mbps+ download speed. yes, even my backyard that was getting sub 1mbps before google wifi. our PS4s, android TVs and other smart devices were finally able to be updated without a hitch and we still test our wifi randomly in the backyard and just laugh about how ridiculous technology has advanced now.\n\nget google wifi NOW - you won't regret it."}

I had problems with my devices randomly disconnecting from the WiFi. At first, I thought maybe it was something to do with my cable modem. After a recent software update to the three points, I noticed the disconnects were becoming more frequent. Thinking I may have to get the points replaced under the warranty, I reached out to Google WiFi Care and had someone help me. Turns out, there was an issue between the main point and the cable modem. Placing the WiFi points in the router's DMZ fixed this and I haven't had any issues since. They also had me set custom DNS servers. If you contact them using the app, they can connect to your network and look at the errors to provide a solution. The whole process took less than thirty minutes. If you're having issues, try setting the router's IP outside of your modem\u2019s firewall or put your modem in bridge mode. If that still doesn't work, contact Google."}

Don't be fooled by signal strength. Although, my Apple products reported the maximum signal strength throughout my home, it did not equate to speed in any way. I confirmed my findings with Google Tech Support and they indicated I was getting the best I could get.\n\nI returned the Google Wifi after 30 days of trying, coughed up an additional $100 and purchased an Orbi with one satellite.

Oh, and this problem has existed since APRIL of 2017. This hardware is junk, and you will be frustrated. One more thing: the router can only be controlled from a mobile device, and the various diagnostic options (like speed test, status, disable a connected device), all all either fake or so unreliable as to be worthless. It reports \"speeds\" which are either not true, or somehow only available to the router itself, and with no indication of the measurement period (it lists it by the DAY! what possible good is network analysis in 24 hour intervals?).

That is a pro and a con. If your not a techie, this is a pro, for a techie they may not like the simplified settings. Digging in, there is not a whole lot of customization you can do, from a router configuration point of view. However, I don't really care about that. All I want is a router that sends signals all through my house, is reliable, easy to manage and fast. Check, check, check, check and check.\n\nPro: Super easy set-up, convenient app to monitor things from, 2.4 and 5 settings are combined so no more switching to the faster one (the system chooses the fastest one for you and connects you automatically) and no more websites to log into with a thousand settings that are confusing.\n\nCons: Only one LAN port (plug-in) per device so you have to buy a switch (but they are cheap), difficult to choose 2.4 or 5 signals if need for programming of wifi devices, no WPS button for auto sinc'ing (that I know of so far)\n\nI would consider myself a moderately intelligent technology person. I have configured routers to perform relatively well and secure in the past. I reached a point where I was really frustrated with the quality of 2.4 signal from all the new routers. I have 2 outdoor wifi cameras on my security system that only use 2.4 signal. All the new high-end routers focus on 5g signal and speed. That is great for my Xbox, Netflix and my streaming recorder, but not for my cameras. Then I kept getting dropped signals it seemed like every week or so which made me have to go in and update, reset and reconfigure some of my settings. It was a big pain (and I'm not divulging what router I had, but it was rated in the top 5 of most websites for multiple years in a row). Then I had to get a range extender for my trailer. Its parked in my drive-way on the side of my house and wasn't getting good signal when I had guests staying out there. The range extender wasn't picking up the signal strong enough and it was creating a separate signal that confused wifi connections and caused them to constantly jump from one to another, disconnecting each time to jump. HASSLE!!!\n\nThank you Google Wifi for solving all that. I walked around my entire house, inside and out and got full signal. Even my trailer gets almost full signal now too (my house is 2200 sq ft, one story). Only the main unit is plugged in and I bought a TP-Link 5 Port Switch to plug in some items (TV, Xbox, DirectTV, security camera recorder). It was a super simple set-up and I went through the App and found all the necessary items and even some fun ones like naming all the connected devices, changing the brightness of the lights on the units and naming the units. As noted in the cons, I found it very difficult to connect to my wifi cameras and configure them. It requires I be on the same 2.4 signal, and its very difficult to connect to a specific signal since your connected automatically to the fastest one. I ended up having to configure them from my old home PC that only has a 2.4 internal connection to work from. Otherwise I would have had to unmount them and hard connect to configure, then go remount them back up outside. I'm sure Google will come up with a fix for this since 2.4 is the default to many devices."}

We have blazing fast internet in the front of the house, but our bedrooms are dead zones. I've tried several brands of repeaters, which all have only provided marginally improved reception. I decided to give the Google WiFi system a try because I was tired of my wife nagging me about how frustrated she is with our Internet. To say that this product exceeded my expectations is an understatement. I am absolutely wowed by the results. Our Internet is now blazing fast no matter where you are in our house, and we even get great reception in our garage!\nInstallation couldn't have been easier. Just install the app on your smart phone and follow the easy directions. I had it up and running in less than 10 minutes with zero problems. The app has many cool features, like being able to pause the Internet to certain devises and check the system performance in each room. The system is a little pricy, but worth every penny and more."}

Not only that but when the Wifi was connected the service was slow and spotty. I know it was the WiFi since my wired devices worked well.\nI did some research and found that Google WiFi had good reviews. I though about buying the 3 pack since I needed extenders with the Airport but figured I would give one a try and buy more if it worked well.\nThe install was about as easy as it gets. Download the app, scan the QR code, name the SSID and password. Done. I connected some devices and ran some speed tests. I have 200M service and was getting tests of up to 150M which is 2x my best test off of the old WiFi with the same service level.

Pre-conceived as a wireless or ethernet wired mesh so easy to set up either way. The mesh speeds far exceeds my incoming ISP speeds. Wifi coverage is excellent and three pucks cover my home well. Because of brick and cinder block walls I had to place them artfully to get 4- 5 bars in all rooms and near incoming ISP speeds.\n\nSome future thinking:\n\nControl is only app based. It is simple and clear. It is fine but a PC GUI would be nice as well.\n\nI wish it were a 4 piece set, router and three nodes. With one node as your router if you want the node further from where you keep your modem it will require longer cabling.\n\nFor Fios customers with TV and Internet:\n\nYou basically can not bridge the Actiontec router if you get TV service. It will disable your VOD and menus.\nYou will essentially have a fios modem/router connected to your google router. This can set up a situation known as double nat, where the routers are individually assigning different ip's to your devices on different router/ networks which may cause them not to communicate.\n\nMy solution which has worked well for me:\nI turned off the verizon wifi and I rely only on google wifi. (some people keep both on for a second private wifi network but it is possible that might cause interference let alone double nat)\nAll of my ethernet devices are connected to the google wifi router with ethernet switches. The nodes communicate through these switches as well. This is a must because the router only has one lan port. The other is your wan. Nothing but the google node is connected to the fios router. So essentially all of my home wired and wireless devices are all on the google wifi network.\n\nOne of my externally web connected devices gave me trouble until I realized that I had to open ports for it in both the fios router and the google wifi router for signals to pass through to and from the web. To do this I assigned the google router a static IP in the fios router an had to assign the device a static Ip and port rules in the google router ( through the app). I tested and could have placed the google router static ip in the dmz of the fios router as an alternative, but I wanted to keep up the fios firewall before the google wifi.(even though google wifi has a built in fire wall as well)\n\nBecause my mesh is hard wired i don't need a wifi backhaul or additional channels for backhaul. I found in another system I had tried that the wifi backhaul slowed down the system and limited the distance between the nodes. I can't comment on google wifi's wireless backhaul range because I am using it as mesh over ethernet.\n\nMoving from one side of the house to another and even outdoors is seamless wifi with one SSID. I am very happy with this system."}

Netgear, Linksys or Google. Ultimately I went with Google because I've been really impressed with Google's hardware lately, the app is fantastic and the WiFi pods are at least 3x more attractive than the Netgear or Linksys options.\n\nPros: I have a 3000 sqft two story house and now I have full wifi everywhere and throughout most of my front and back yards. 200+mbps internet speeds while drinking beer on the patio, yes please. Not only do I have full coverage, but google's network algorithm and the ability of the system to toggle between frequencies, I've experienced consistently faster speeds vs. my Netgear Nighthawk router. And my Nighthawk was pretty spectacular (more about that in the cons). You can adjust the light ring around the other pods so if you're putting them in a guest room you can turn the light off. Setup is super easy, you just follow the on screen instructions on the app. Took me under 30 minutes to hook up all three pods. Realistically <10 minutes and the rest was re-syncing my Nest, SmartThings hub, and Racchio. You can also prioritize internet traffic, create a guest network and configure which areas of the network guests can access. If you're new to networking this is a stellar option. You can also hard wire the pods so that they have better speeds. I've done this and you just get insane speeds over wifi (note: i have 1 gbps internet, so your results may vary).\n\nCons: You can only tinker with the Google WiFi system via the app. If you're looking for the ability to tweak more advanced settings, this is not the system for you. In this respect the Netgear Nighthawk is must more advanced than Google. You also can't tell the Google WiFi system to stay on a dedicated frequency. The system natively switches to the least congested frequency, which so far I've found to be excellent, but you can't change it if that's something you're into. Netgear and Linksys allow for dedicated frequency choices, so I'm not sure exactly why Google went this route.\n\nOverall: Google has hit a home run with the Google WiFi system. I hope they continually improve upon it, and find ways to integrate it with Google Home or even eventually allow Google Home to function as an extender to the system. I'm super happy with the purchase and would recommend this system to pretty much anyone. Considering this is one of the least expensive and best reviewed MESH WiFi systems, I can't imagine anything less than a 5 star product."}

But we should have the option to be able to force specific bands when we want to, or to turn off a band all together. These are very basic options which I can't for the life of me figure out why Google removed.\n\nHere is the issue with the auto band selections: by not being able to select a specific band, you have to get lucky during the set up of some devices. For example, the Ring Pro doorbell connects to your network based off of whatever network your phone is on. If it is on the 5ghz band, you are screwed because the Ring does not suupport anything other than 2.4ghz. (My phone won't allow me to select my band either). The only way we were able to get the Ring to work was to keep checking out phones and when we finally saw that one was on the 2.4ghz band I ran over to the Ring to initialize setup before I lost it. Other smart devices in my home find the internet the same way, which isn't very smart but it seems to be the norm for these devices (water heater, light bulbs, etc).\n\nThe other major issues is that for devices that DO support 5ghz, I need on that band and I also need to change the channel of my 2.4ghz which you also can't do since Google is supposed to be moving you to \"the best.\" Being in a semi rural area, I have fixed wireless internet which utilizes 2.4ghz on channel 3. Since Google wifi is just blasting whatever it thinks is best, it steps all over the actual internet coming into the house. Even thjough my speeds are still more than sufficient for streaming, gaming etc, I get a ton of latency and buffering issues due to the ointerference my devices are creating all because Google wants to auto switch everything.\n\nLike I said, I wanted to love it, and the mesh is geeat, but until Google allows for advanced options these units are sub par."}

What an improvement to my home network!! This system is vastly better than a router and a second non-meshed access point to provide good Wi-Fi coverage throughout my house!\n\nMy home's construction blocks Wi-Fi in certain areas. Before I purchased Google Wifi, I had two Zyxel routers: one in router mode and the other in access point mode. The router was hardwired to my cable modem, and the access point was hardwired through the attic back to the router. Although this setup provided coverage all over the house, and some coverage for outdoor areas, it came with irritating problems. Because the router and access point were not meshed, they could not hand off my connection. If I came into the front door, my phone, tablet, and/or laptop would attach to the access point in the front of the house, which was fine, so long as I stayed in the front of the house. The problem was that my devices would stay connected to the access point in the front of the house even when I moved to the back of the house where the router resides. The connection to the access point would degrade to only one bar of signal which was inadequate to do much of anything. Web pages would load at a snail's pace, and streaming video or music were a no-go. To overcome this, I would have to go into my phone/tablet/laptop settings, manually disconnect from the access point, and then connect to the router sitting just a few feet away. Then any time I returned to the front of the house, I would again have to manually disconnect from the router and connect to the access point. This was very annoying.\n\nEnter Google's meshed Wi-Fi! Each Google Wifi access point has the intelligence to detect when wireless signal has degraded and transfers my phone's, tablet's, or laptop's connection over to another physically closer Google Wifi access point in the home network where signal is stronger. This is very similar to how a your cellular service moves your connection from tower to tower as you travel down the highway.\n\nInstallation was extremely easy and very intuitive. I installed the Google Wifi app on my smartphone before starting the installation. Then I just followed the instruction wizard to perform the installation. I believe it was straightforward enough for a person with limited technical ability to readily install without a hitch.\n\nThe Google Wifi smartphone app also includes handy tools that give you visibility to what devices are connected inside your network and how well your Internet service is performing. I did not think to take screenshots while doing the installation, but I will include screenshots of some of the tools within the app."}

His makes setup very easy and intuitive. Once setup, the system worked reliably.\n\nIf you are willing to trust a multinational conglomerate, like Google, who\u2019s aim is to collect as much data as possible from its users in order to increase revenue (and product quality), then Google WiFi is a great choice. If you are unwilling to put your trust in a company who generates profit from data collection, then you should look elsewhere.\n\nAfter testing the Google WiFi, Linksys Velop and Eero mesh systems, and also researching their privacy policies, Eero has proved the only company least motivated to share network data with advertisers, third parties, etc., since their business focuses exclusively on the product they have designed and manufactured. Eero is located in the United States and so is their customer service. When I called, I talked to knowledgeable people who were 100 percent transparent about their privacy policy and how your data is collected and used to improve their product (hardware/software). This, coupled by the product\u2019s intuitive app, easy setup and fantastic hardware, is why I have chosen Eero for our mesh WiFi system."}

I have a 3000sft home and over 30 devices plus guests that use our Wi-Fi. It has forever been a challenge since we live in a neighborhood that has tons of Wi-Fi enabled systems and routers. That on top of the dead spots that plague all houses added to the issues. We originally invested in a dual band router that initially solved our speed issues using the 5g band but that signal did not travel throughout the house and our devices would automatically connect BACK to the 2.4g band which was spotty and slow. Very frustrating.\n\nThe straw that broke the back if you will was my wife's car was recently broken into and our Ring doorbell did not capture the incident. We decided to invest in a new Ring device that is plugged in, mounted, and pointed them right at our cars. Great solution we thought . . purchased the product and installed it with no problem until we tried to get on our wifi. You guessed it . . it only get the 2.4g signal and it was barely getting that.\n\nDid my research and landed on the Mesh network systems. We have Sonos so was worried about those. But I purchased anyway!\n\nResults: Best decision we have made is quit sometime. It was so easy to set up. You need to be PATIENT and follow the instructions very carefully. do not rush. I unplugged all my connected devices and THEN installed the Google system. After I got that up and running, I restarted all the devices and with minimal to NO issues, everything was back up and running. This is KEY. Since the Google wifi is becoming the new host for IP addresses that all your systems need to get internet accesss, each system needs to pull a new address from the Google Wifi. Seems as though if you do not restart the device, there are IP address conflicts all over the place.\n\nThe other advise I can give is do NOT plug it in to your existing router. By a $20 hub and plug that into the LAN port on one of the Google pucks. I have a Ethernet throughout my entire house and have 2 hubs connected to the Google wifi system and it is working great! I found that some of the issues people are having seem to stem from attempting to use their existing routers and using these to expand their network. That is not needed. These pucks are powerful little buggers. It is true that the app does not allow to do all the fancy networking stuff that you can do with today's wireless routers so If you do want more features, this not for you . . I am sure they will ramp up and provide those in the future, but the only feature they needed to give us was the magic power of the 'Family WiFi\"! With a touch of a button, we can turn off the Wi-Fi Signal to our children's iPads! So nice!"}

So what good was wi-fi at 90mbs next to the modem if less than 50 feet away it was terrible. So I decided to try a mesh system. The Google system had good reviews but I was concerned a lot about being able to VPN to my office. This was because there was a lot of negative discussion about this on the internet. I was also concerned about having to switch out my modem/router to just a modem and then find out that Google Wi Fi was no better. So I decided to give it a try and figured out how to disable the wi-fi in my cable company provided modem/router. The Google Wi-fi was set up in about 15 minutes for all three modules. I checked the speeds and they were no better. I was mad. So I went into the modem/router setup to enable its wi-fi ( so I could return to what I had before and return Google wi-fi to Amazon) and discovered that I must have checked disable but did not save it. So this time I selected disable and save. When I went back and checked the speeds in the various areas of my house I was amazed. My speeds were all great. This stuff works.

Why they couldn't stuff them behind a \"Advanced Features - you've been warned\" section (or better, leave Mesh enabled while in Bridge mode) is something that no one can quite figure out.\n\nBottom line: if you want a fairly easy to use and decently performing Wifi mesh network system and don't have any wired devices (or devices that would require manually changing their IPs - IoT devices, etc) than Google Wifi is a decent choice. If you have *any* special devices or must have your ISP router/modem directly connected to anything - look elsewhere, this isn't the system for you."}

While I understand that somewhat, they have no IT knowledge and had to wait on someone to set it up (being me). The range on these things literally cannot travel between the floor in their house so it is useless.\n\nA speed test was giving them maybe 75% of the speed their old router did.\n\nThe only reason it is getting 2 stars is because the setup is easy and the GUI is really nice."}

Does not work reliably with AT&T Wi-Fi calling. Wi-Fi calling worked before with the TP-Link. Ooma does work.\n3. Google Wi-Fi app is great, when it works. Sometimes if I open the app, it will not find the Google wifi points even though I am connected to them with no problems. Then sometimes the app will crash the entire system. This requires a power cycling. I have been power cycling a lot. (Note: this was a power cycle of the Google Wi-Fi only. Not the cable modem, so it isn't my incoming network)\n\nUPDATE: Purchased a timer to power cycle every night. Works much better now\n\nI hope these are just bugs that will be fixed in a future release. If you want seamless unreliable coverage in your home, Google Wi-Fi will work fine.

Now, with this mesh system, getting a signal almost anywhere on the property (including in the back yard) is no problem anymore. The best part about it is that the speed is top-notch everywhere!

At about $100 per unit, the Google Wi-Fi is a great performer. What makes this device stand out is the brain-dead simple set up. The app is available on IOS and I am going to review that app as well.\n\nWhat you need: An active Google Account. You wanted one anyway.\n\nHere is what you do: Just hook your first Google Wifi into your existing router (modem). There is no need to disconnect your current system as the Google system will recognize your router. Open the app and log in. The app will instantly locate and configure your new MESH device. For the other two devices, just plug them into the power and the app WILL find them. It's got to be the most intuitive process I have ever seen on a router. Gone is the old fashioned CISCO type interface with a seemingly endless list of items most people can't even grasp. There are some power user settings for port forwarding and other tidbits... but you can search the You Tube and see many demonstrations of how this works.\n\nThe IOS app worked like someone from Apple crossed the valley and made the app. It's really a nice app. If you read reviews for IOS, you can see that it does a good job.\n\nNow for a few cons: It isn't the absolute fastest router. It uses AC1200 2x2 Wave 2 Wifi and there are systems with \"faster\" throughput. I can't make a fair comparison to other brands, however. The second con may be that it won't be as \"configurable' as a standard router. Some power users may not like that the system isn't really that flexible for some purposes. The lack of a web-based interface is annoying. Even when I tried to access the device using the standard IP port via Chrome, I was unable to see the device. For most home users, this isn't an issue. But, I would like to at least do some adjustments on my MacBook or PC and you can't do it.\n\nBut, overall my experience was very good. Given that my house and yard is only about 3000 sq ft, this system allows me blazing speeds and great coverage even when I and my wife are using it. I suspect that it will suit most users out there and most people will be very happy.\n\nI'd give this device a solid 4 only due to the lack of a web interface. I think this is a great product overall."}

Then release button and wait about 5 minutes for it to reset.) I had the system up and running. After it automatically ran the software update, I wanted to see if Google WiFi was worth the money. It is, no question.\n\nPrior to the Google WiFi, I had a Linksys AC1750 dual band that was about 3 years old. I was able to achieve around 50/60 Mbps if I was right next to the router and on 5Ghz. With the Google WiFi, I consistently get between 180 and 250 Mbps. Blazing fast for Xfinity. Also since it broadcasts one network on both 2.5 and 5Ghz I no longer have to manually switch networks or run slower printers and computers on the 2.5Ghz network. You'll only have one network and can let the router decide who goes where.\n\nI also have ethernet cables run into each room so I hooked up ethernet backhaul for the two remote units. It really didn't make much of a difference. About 10Mbps extra on average. Not worth considering if you don't have cables run throughout the space because the Mesh is amazingly fast without it.\n\nWithout a doubt the Google WiFi has made a world of difference in my enjoyment of surfing and my Roku is now screaming fast.

Connect a small switch to a mesh point and then you can have multiple wired devices attached (which is superior to having each with their own wifi).\n\nAt first, I did not realize that you could wire these into the LAN, so I had them all running completely wireless. I would occasionally find that one of them would drop out of the mesh though. Also, in the mesh speed test, I would get less than great results. I struggled finding optimal positioning for full coverage.\n\nWhat eventually worked for me was to connect two of them to the LAN, and only one of them is wirelessly connected to the mesh. In my experience, wiring them to the LAN is more advantageous than positioning - in other words, if I have to choose between an optimal position in a room vs. wiring it in to the LAN in the same room, I would go with wiring it in. The mesh is smart enough to use the fastest route for each point, whether that be wired or wireless. Right now, if I run a mesh test, I get \"great\" scores on all mesh points. Pro tip - after you run the mesh test, you can touch the \"...\" menu in top right , then \"Details\" to get actual bandwidth for each point. Coverage is perfect in the house - no dead or slow spots."}

The gazebo has a flat screen television , ROKU, and Amazon Dot. Trying to stream Netflix or YouTube on the gazebo television was an exercise in frustration, with constant buffering. Alexa was pretty much off line every time I tried to use it.\n\nMaking matters worse, my home has terrible cellular coverage, so I rely on the Wi-Fi Calling setting on my iPhone to make and receive phone calls while at home. Even though I have a really good wireless router, calls were really hit and miss unless we were close to the router.\n\nI installed three Google Wi-Fi pucks, I\u2019ll call them, and the result was more than I had hoped for. The first is next to the computer in the office upstairs, the second is basically beneath that one on the floor below, and the third is as far back in the house as I could place it so that it would hopefully cover the gazebo.\n\nMy direct cable connection in the office had always clocked in at a solid 100 Mbps, with the downstairs computer at about 30 Mbps and the gazebo at 7 Mbps on a good day. The 30 Mbps wasn't terrible, but it's frustrating to be limited to 30 (or, ugh, 7) when you are paying for 100, simply because you are having to use a wireless connection. With the Google pucks installed (installation was sooo easy), I now get 100 Mbps at EACH puck, and the speed at the gazebo is over 30Mbps. What a joy to be able to use the outside television with lighting fast response and no buffering. Equally exciting, I can now use my cell phone anywhere in the house or out in the gazebo.\n\nHere is the important point I want to pass along. Logic may not dictate the best placement of the pucks. It seemed logical to me that I would place the second puck in a line-of-sight position from the first, in a position that looks down on the third puck by the back door. But even though the app reported that everything was fine and dandy, when I tested the relative strengths of the pucks (easy to do with the app), number 2 reported only as \u201cfair\u201d, and the downstairs computer was only hitting 30 Mbps. I then tried moving number 2 to the ground floor, right next to the computer. That seemed counter-intuitive since number 1 now had to broadcast through a floor, and there was now a wall between 2 and 3, but with that change the remote pucks both showed as \u201cgreat\u201d and the connection speed jumped to 100 Mbps.\n\nBottom line: Don\u2019t rely on your logic. Move the pucks around until you achieve the best possible coverage, which may be in positions that seem illogical.\n\nBonus tip: Although the speed to the puck at my ground floor computer was over 100 Mbps (tested with my iPhone touching adjacent to the puck), the speed being reported on the computer itself was less than 100, because even though it was just a foot away from the puck, the wireless connection was slowing the speed. By simply connecting the computer to the puck with a network cable, the speed increased by over 40 Mbps.\n\nBonus tip 2: Your Amazon Dots and Echos can now be used as a whole-house audio system, playing whatever music you select on whatever \u201cgroups\u201d you choose to configure. My Dot in the gazebo is plugged into the TV's surround sound system, and I wanted to be able to have the same music playing inside and outside through the Alexa devices. Previously I couldn\u2019t get it to work because the connection to the outside Dot was just so poor that Alexa refused to make it part of a group. Since installing the Google pucks, Alexa finally let my outside Dot join in the reindeer games. So nice to have the same music playing everywhere.\n\nBonus tip 3: The app allows you adjust the brightness of the status lights on the pucks. I turned one of them up to the maximum setting in order to create a night light for that area."}

Since my house is pretty small it surprised me that I had signal issues downstairs with devices that were only 15 feet or so away from the Netgear... but with 2 walls and an old thick hardwood floor in between it was enough to cause significant signal loss. My Fire TV Stick would buffer half the time only 15 feet away.\n\nI looked at several different Mesh Wifi systems from Orbi, Velop, to Eero before I settled on Google Wifi. While some of these other system like the Velop are faster and have more advanced features I just had a hard time justifying the price of the other systems. It really came down to the Velop and Google Wifi for me. I really liked being able to still using web management and the advanced networking features with Velop but at double the price for the Velop I realized it wasn't worth it because in reality I really don't use any of those advances at the moment... it was a nice thing to have just incase.\n\nSo I got this pack of Google Wifi and I put one of them upstairs and another downstairs and then the third one I put in my shed to cover the backyard and my fire pit. I hardwired all three of these Google Wifi points so backhaul doesn't need to use Wifi which gives me a consistent 400Mbs download speeds next to all three points. There wasn't a strong enough signal out to my shed for that point to get decent wireless backhaul speeds which is another reason why I wanted to hardwire everything. Now my whole house and backyard is completely covered with good Wifi... anywhere in my house and backyard I'm getting at least 200Mbs download speeds. I'm getting these speeds on a Pixel XL phone using the Ookla app for speed tests to the internet."}

I had been waiting for a year to get this as I was hoping the cost would go down a little bit. Since the price was lowered to $265 I decided to pull the trigger. Then when I was checking out I got an offer to apply for an Amazon Prime Visa card and receive an instant $70 gift card! So it ended up costing me $195 plus tax for the set of three!\n\nFirst, the packaging. Now I'm a stickler for awesome product packaging, and Google Wifi did not disappoint. The unboxing experience was very satisfying and incredibly simple, as was the install. Now my house is only about 1,400 square feet, and according to the box I would technically only need one puck, but I wanted my house blanketed in sweet, blazing fast wifi, so I installed all three. Set-up was ridiculously easy. You hook-up the first puck to your modem, download the Google Wi-fi app, and it recognizes your first puck and connects to it. Then, you walk around your house and install the second puck the same way. Just plug it into power and the app will find it and connect to it. Repeat again for the third puck. Once all three pucks are installed and the app has found them, it links all three of them via the mesh network. The entire set-up and linking process took about 10-15 minutes. Once it was done, you can use the app to check internet speed, wifi speed and how good the mesh network is communicating with each puck.\n\nSo with three pucks installed in my measly 1,400 sf house, I am now happy to say that I indeed have \"SUPER WIFI\" in my home. No matter where I am in my house my devices all have a 100% full-strength signal. The signal never even dips down some, it's always full strength. Every single nook and cranny that I can check produces the same results. I have a smart tv in my living room that loads and plays youtube videos instantly now. My ps4 connects to the network just as fast as when it was wired. And you can even hardwire devices directly to the google pucks as well. My main puck that connects to my modem is also hard wired to my pc. And my ADT ihub in my living room is plugged directly into one of my other pucks. I now also have almost 100% full strength wifi in my backyard around my pool area.\n\nSo in closing, I could not be any happier with my purchase. I waited a long time to get this system, and I cannot even believe that I only paid $195 for three pucks. Unboxing and set-up was a breeze, and actually enjoyable. Wifi is blazing fast. And I love the complete control from the app... no pc needed. So happy!"}

I'm in a relatively small, 1100sqft apartment, so I assumed the XB3 provided by Comcast would be perfectly fine. This was not the case. I had to be in the same room as the gateway to even pick up the 5ghz signal, and the 2.4ghz band didn't even make it in the closet. 1100sqft - seriously? The interference from so many neighbors defeated the Comcast modem. I decided to try the TP-Link AV1200 Power Line Starter Kit, 3-Port Gigabit, Pass-through, Up to 1200Mbps(TL-PA8030P KIT) to get Ethernet into the different rooms of the apartment instead, with similarly poor results. Any time the washer or dryer would run, the powerline signal would drop out rendering the device useless.\n\nI decided to try the Google Wifi system because I wanted to hardwire most devices with Ethernet, here's how I have it set up:\nLiving Room: Comcast XB3 (garbage) in bridge mode -> Primary Google Wifi Circle -> Ethernet switch -> 10 devices\nOffice: Secondary Google Wifi Circle -> Ethernet to 2 PCs\nBedroom: Secondary Google Wifi Circle -> Ethernet to Smart TV\n\nI LOVE it, I have a 75/10 internet plan, and consistently see the full speed on every single device connected. The Google Wifi seamlessly hands off 5ghz devices to the proper band and there's no need to have wifiNetwork-2.4 and wifiNetwork-5 broadcasting like other routers do. The ethernet ports on the secondary circles make you forget that you're technically using wireless the connection quality and ping is so consistent. The interference from all of the neighbors is no match for this device. Using a wifi analyzer app, there isn't a single spot in my apartment where it can measure any degradation as compared to the Comcast modem which was degraded in the same room.\n\nThe setup is very simple, and I haven't had any issue with the ethernet switches. The app automatically tests your local DNS and IPv6 to determine if your modem supports them. If Google DNS benchmarks faster, it will use it by default. The app has a beautiful breakdown of devices connected and data usage that destroys the Comcast xFi app. Lastly, the guest work has a simple interface for passing devices through. For example, you can set Chromecasts to be accessible from the Guest network, but no other devices. This is great for guests who want to use the television without needing your real password, which is where most guest networks fall short at."}

This is supposed to be a no-brainer but that's what happened to me. Before it was too late I returned it. My OnHub has been working fine for over a year but I wanted better coverage in remote parts of my house. I had earlier purchased another OnHub before \u0010Google offered this Wifi Point to make a mesh but Google was never able to get that to work with my primary OnHub either. They finally determined this second OnHub was defective and arranged for it to be replaced. This was also tried along with Google tech support guidance but in frustration, no go either. In my experience I think their mesh networking arrangement is not quite ready for prime time. I've read that others have had success but then why couldn't Google tech support get my setup to function? Maybe I'll try again with this Google Wifi point in the future hoping Google will have it all worked out. I guess my 2nd OnHub will be a spare.

I cancelled cable about 6 months ago and signed up for SlingTv. I then bought 5 Roku Tvs for my house (they even have a SlingTv button on the remote) which I use with an antenna. I have 3 Tvs on my 2nd floor, one on my first floor in the living room and one in my basement. With a few exceptions, I enjoy SlingTv but I was having serious connectivity issues with my 2nd floor and basement Tvs. In particular, streaming HBO on demand through SlingTv was unbearable. I tried range extenders which helped a little bit, but if you were considering cancelling cable and signing up for a streaming service and came to my house, you wouldn't be convinced to do it.\n\nGoogle WiFi was the answer. I have 1 receiver in my home office (1 room over from my living room Tv), one in my basement and one in a 2nd floor bedroom which is located in the middle of the floor. The speed in lightening fast and my Tv hasn't buffered since.\n\nI wish the solution was a little cheaper, and I'm sure the price will come down my Christmas, but it is well worth the cost to eliminate the frustration."}

Bedrooms are on the opposite side of the house with plaster walls in between. Our Apple Airport Extreme was good getting the wifi halfway, but we lost the signal in the bedrooms and got nothing in the opposite corner of the house. Using a Netgear extender with the Airport Extreme didn't help much.\n\nInstalled the Google mesh and now we are covered.\nMain puck in the living room gets 110 Mbps download and 11 Mbps upload. (no change from Apple router)\nOffice gets 75-85 Mbps download and 11 Mbps up. (more reliable now, no dropped wifi on our Nintendo Switch)\nBedroom now gets 75 Mbps down and 11 Mbps up. (where before we were getting next to nothing or dropped signals.)\n\nFor a basic user I think this system works great. I can assign IP addresses to my connected devices. I can prioritize what device gets the bandwidth. I can lower or turn off the LED on the pucks in the bedroom so it's not glowing. I can see what device is currently using bandwidth and how much.\n\nI was hesitant at first about ordering this because of all the reviews that say the features are limited, but if you just want to set up wifi that covers the house and you want some basic router features this system is perfect for 95% of the people out there.\n\nWill update this is anything changes."}

They'd eat up the bandwidth making it nearly impossible to watch Hulu. (Hulu has no buffer, so latency is a real problem.) I had hoped that the device prioritization would finally solve this problem for be, but unfortunately device prioritization does next to nothing. Called customer support and was told it was because my son's computer was plugged in directly rather than using wifi. So I rearranged the nodes so the priority devices were plugged in and sunk even more money into a wifi adapter for my son's computer. This had no effect. YouTube and Netflix still consume 99% of the banddoeswidth regardless of how they're wired, and regardless of device prioritization. It's literally useless.\n\nThe \"mesh\" does provide better coverage than a stand alone router, but no better than can be accomplished with a simple wifi range extender.\n\nThe ability to pause internet access is nice for parents, but can be a hassle when you need internet access for a few minutes during a scheduled pause. You can only \"end early\" the scheduled pause which means you then have to manually repause each device individually setting an end time for each which takes a lot of time to do. It has an option to 'delay pause for 30 minutes', but this can only be done before the pause begins. This needs to be an option any time during a pause.\n\nAll in all, good, but not worth the money. Hopefully, future updates will improve functionality and help justify this purchase for me."}

You download the Google wifi app, plug in your main one where you have your modem, and spread out the other two throughout the house.

I have the main one upstairs in a bedroom, the second in the kitchen that is downstairs below the bedroom, and the third in the laundry room across the house which provides connection inside the garage and even the driveway. The signal and connection do degrade in the garage, but it was better than what I had before, which was barely 1 bar.\n\nI have not had any speed issues on any of my devices which includes phones, TVs, and three computers; one of which is hardline via a Linksys switch I purchased.\n\nThe 3 star rating is due to reliability. I am not home during the daytime, so I do not know if there are any issues then, but during the evening while I was on my computer, the main unit rebooted itself without any sort of notice, resulting in the internet to go down throughout the house. My modem was still on and connected. After a about a minute, everything back back online on its own. That happened on a few occasions already. The 2nd issue I just experienced over the weekend was the main unit was flashing red for about 4 hours. I woke up in the middle of the night to do something and saw the main unit flashing red. I went over to my computer and saw that the VoIP application I always have running was disconnected about 4 hours prior, which is most likely when the main unit started flashing. I unplugged the unit's power for about 10 seconds, plugged it back in, and everything came back online. I have no idea why it would just disconnect like that, or why it would reboot the other times just randomly. I still have not found a pattern or what could be causing these reboots or disconnects."}

I\u2019ve always wanted Wi-Fi coverage throughout my fairly large, 2-story home. But with previous dual-band routers, I would only get the full Wi-Fi speed with a device (like my iPhone), when I was fairly close to the router and the device would connect to the 5 GHz channel. When I would get more than 30 feet away (in another room), my devices would typically connect to the stronger 2.4 GHz signal, and I would get slower Wi-Fi speeds.\n\nThe Google Wifi system has been outstanding. With the 3-devices and the mesh network, I now get full Wi-Fi coverage throughout my house with 60 Mbps+ speed. So my Wi-Fi network is no longer the bottleneck, but the bottleneck is the cable modem connection to my Internet Service Provider (which is as it should be). I no longer worry about switching my devices between the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels to try to get the best speed. The Google Wifi system \u201cjust works\u201d without me having to think about it. It was very simple and fast to setup. By following the guidance on the excellent Google Wifi app, I had all 3 devices setup and tested in less than 30 minutes.\n\nI have read a few reviews here that have stated a con that the Google Wifi system only has 1 wired port on the router. I disagree. This allowed Google to keep the design of the devices much smaller and consistent. You can buy a 5-port Ethernet switch for $10 and connect to the main Google Wifi router to expand the number of wired ports if needed. That was a smart design decision by Google, in my opinion. Google\u2019s description of \u201cHome Wi-Fi, simply solved\u201d, is 100% accurate."}

Setup was as simple as plugging the units in and turning on the app. The system does the rest, with step by step instructions and automated processes. The smartphone app is incredibly user friendly, and very useful. I can monitor connected devices, run an internet speed test, and test connectivity between points, getting position recommendations if one needs moved. Most valuable for our family, I can group kids' devices and pause them with one-click (i.e. for dinner) or schedule bedtime disconnects. All of this is accessible whether you are in your home or across the country (in case the babysitter calls).\n\nI am certainly impressed with the coverage in our three-thousand square foot home. The office is on one end, and the family room is on a different level on the complete opposite end (long way). The family room always suffered, which was bad for streaming services. Now, we have full coverage from corner to corner, thanks to three Google WiFi points.\n\nI look forward to reporting on the prolonged performance of the system."}

After years of trying to solve signal issues throughout my house, with a series of access points and powerline adapters, I thought I'd found my perfect solution. When I saw the mesh capabilities, I was blown away. This is a product that should be getting five stars. Instead, I'm barely giving it three. Reason? Let's look at the pros and cons from my first impression:\nPros:\n1) It's beautiful as well as unobstrusive\n2) The setup is literally idiot-proof\n3) The coverage is absolutely awesome! No deadzones. The issue of changeover of access points is handled smoothly and without lag\n\nCons:\nThis is where I've taken off two stars because it lacks the basic configuration functions of a simple router:\n1) Your subnet is locked at 192.168.86.xxx. You can't change it. You can't configure it to anything else\n2) THERE IS NO WEB INTERFACE....I repeat, NO WEB INTERFACE. You have to configure your network from a phone or tablet. Imagine trying to configure an entire network from a phone!\n3) There is no listing of devices with IPs. You have to go into each device to see the IP. Additionally, you have to dig to set static IPs. Again, imagine configuring 15 security cameras like that!\n\nAll in all, if you're a neophyte or just interested in getting good coverage around your home, with no advanced networking requirements, then this product is right for you and you should consider this a five star product. If, however, you want to be able to configure your network to your own requirements, you are in for a sore disappointment. My workaround for the lack of a web interface was to install an Android emulator on my PC and install the app. However, the advanced networking functionality is completely absent.\n\nSo, while I love the wifi coverage, if you have serious network needs, I'd not recommend it for you."}

Tried a wifi extender with mixed results. Finally took the plunge on this mesh network. One week in, and it's been great.\n\nInstallation was pretty easy. The only hangup was due to my Comcast modem being problematic. I called the Google support number given by the app during set up. I was talking to a real human speaking real English in less than two minutes. Google is clearly giving top-tier customer service to this product.\n\nOnce the modem issue was solved, I had three hubs up and running easily (there was on hangup when syncing the second hub, but I just restarted the process and it worked fine). Since then, I have had ZERO problems with the network. All my appliances signed on with no problem, and even the hardwired things (Hue, NAS) jumped right back in with no hick-ups.\n\nMy only niggle is the lack of LAN ports, as each hub only has one. But, I guess if they added more, the device would not be as small as it is. Plus, I was able to move one appliance (Xbox), off of ethernet and on to wifi because the new signal is so strong all over the house. Worst case, you can always add a switch, if needed.\n\nGetting 84mb download speeds next to the primary hub, and 40 - 50mb download next to the satellite hubs. And getting 35mb in the bedroom, which is two rooms removed from the closest hub. My Nest cam, which was the driving factor in getting the new network, has been 100% online since the install. Before, when it was running off an extender, it would drop offline randomly, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nOverall, VERY satisfied and would most def recommend to a friend."}

{"Author": "Zendude", "Date": "on August 21, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Not market ready", "Text": "I thought a Google Wifi mesh would be ideal for a property with several buildings in rural Maine, allowing access to our limited DSL-based internet from various locations within a small campus. It could, I assumed, exploit existing cat5e wired connections where they exist, and fill in via wireless mesh connections elsewhere. I'd read rave reviews, and had great expectations based on Google's reputation, other products, and various contacts there.\n\nSo I bought a 3-pack of \"Wifi Points\" and set up a little trial network on a corner of the property. I was alarmed to discover that I couldn't expand the mesh by adding a WP whose only connection to the primary WP was via wired ethernet, but eventually discovered the workaround of configuring via nearby wireless connection and then moving the new WP to its final -- wired -- location, and got a 3-node network working. After exercising it a bit for a few hours, I (optimistically, it turns out) ordered a bunch more WPs with the idea of covering the property with a uniform mesh. That unrealistic goal cost me more than a kilobuck and many, many days of frustrating configuration hell.\n\nI won't detail the myriad problems I ran into here, although I have many email exchanges with Google customer service that document most of them. But some of the high points:\n\n(1) Configuration requires an IOS or Android app. I was using IOS, and found the app VERY unsatisfactory. On many occasions it just hangs; in other case, it fails without giving any useful explanation. My most recent complaint is that it complains that the mesh is \"offline\", and won't do anything with it, despite a valid connection to the mesh network by the ipad running it.\n\n(2) Virtually zero diagnostic information is available. The mesh configures itself by exploring the connectivity graph among WPs, and building an acyclic spanning tree for routing packets; but it hides the structure of this routing configuration (apparently from the customer service people as well as the user). If the app is working (not always the case), you can query connectivity of devices (like computers and ipads), and determine which WP they are connected to as well as their recent bandwidth usage -- good features. But there's apparently no way to discover the connectivity among WPs, and some evidence that it is not always sensible.\n\n(3) Misrepresentation of status. On many occasions I've built configurations of 6 or 7 nodes that the app thinks are working \"great\", with white lights on each node (signifying no problems). But allegedly working WPs were radio-silent: after testing over long periods with many devices, supposedly working WPs had NO discernible wifi activity (eg, not broadcasting the SSID). I've observed this behavior with many of the 12 WPs I now own, and am convinced its not a hardware failure (despite the assurance by some Google customer service people that this \"can't happen\" with working WPs).\n\n(4) Handing out bad IP addresses. On several occasions, I had an otherwise-working mesh with a new WP plugged in, waiting to be set up, and observed the following bizarre behavior: a device connects to an established WP (nowhere near the node waiting to be set up), and gets assigned an IP address of the form 192.168.84.* rather than expected 192.168.86.* addresses Google has chosen for their mesh. I turns out that the setup-mode device advertises another SSID on .84.* addresses for temporary connections during setup, a reasonable (and commonly used) approach. But the fact that the mesh gets confused by this extra Google-supplied DHCP server and uses it (rather than the DHCP of the primary WP) seems remarkable. This bug is avoidable by not trying to use the mesh while a WP is in setup mode, but seems one of many examples of extremely sloppy design.\n\n(5) Self-wounding. In the interests of making the mesh self-healing, the routing configuration is periodically re-evaluated and perhaps changed. However, on several occasions I went to bed with a working (or mostly working -- perhaps a node or two \"offline\") and woke up to a completely non-functional mesh -- red lights everywhere, no network connectivity. Of course, I had no clue as to what happened: no log, no error report, no diagnostic. Just sudden death.\n\nThere are many other issues that can be added to this list; these are just representative examples.\n\nAbout customer service: I talked to a number of gwifi service people, who were uniformly pleasant and polite (despite growing frustration on my part). Each was armed with a set of steps and suggestions for chasing the simplest of bugs, as well as some pieces of inconsistent and/or bad advice. One insisted that I replace all my cheap/dumb gigabit switches with managed switches. Several suggested that the switches might be blocking critical packets in their spanning tree protocol. Some insisted that using LAN vs WAN ports of secondaries is critical, others claimed it didn't matter. Generally, when I heard suspicious advice, I asked to speak to a supervisor (or more expert colleague); while this may have irritated some agents, they generally complied politely. I eventually wound up communicating (mostly by email) with a competent technical guy who seemed well intentioned but simply didn't have the resources to solve the problems I was presenting him with. He had the ear of a \"product expert\" (who I would have loved to talk to directly), but we apparently exhausted this pocket of expertise as well.\n\nI've been forced to conclude that there are serious flaws in the GWifi system that will require substantial additional development effort to correct. If I put my dozen WPs in a box in the attic for a year, its possible that some future firmware upgrade will make them work; however, by then I hope to have installed a mesh technology that actually works. Having stupidly discarded the Apple-esque packaging they were shipped in, my WPs seem destined to be distributed as party favors for some geek gathering or wind up in a landfill somewhere.\n\nIts worth noting that other have had similar frustration with this product. If you dig deeper, looking e.g. at discussion in technical forms, you get a different, very mixed picture from what is portrayed in the superficial reviews. If you're considering this product, I suggest you do this additional research; I wish I had done so."}

BAD CHOICE!\n\nFirst, let understand how Mesh network works using basic language - Normally, we are used to have one Wifi router in our homes. Imagine using a compass drawing a circle, the center would be where the Wifi router would be and the circle would be the signal coverage area. Obviously, in real world, this \"signal coverage\" is rarely a perfect circle (like when you have a wall behind the Wifi router and clear open space on other sides). It doesn't help even more when cable providers normally drill a hole into one side of the house for cable to run in. We then set up the modem and Wifi router there and get poor signal on the other side of the house. Mesh network solves this problem by creating multiple Wifi \"signal coverage\" areas. You have one unit acting as a Main Wifi router connecting into the modem, another unit will be sitting within \"coverage area\" of the first one. This 2nd one will talk to the first one and create its own \"coverage area\" with itself being the center. As you add more units, the total \"coverage area\" would become bigger and bigger. However, remember when you still have your old Wifi router and the signal was weak at the other side of the house? Mesh network experiences similar problem as well - the second unit has to be in a good signal spot in order for it to communicate well with the main unit and able to provide you with similar performance as if you were connecting into the main unit. If you place it too far out, you will still get good signal but remember, your performance still depending on the ability of the 2nd unit talking to the main unit. If it can barely talk to the main unit, no matter how close you are to it, your internet performance will suffer. The signal strength doesn't do much here beside giving you a fake belief that your wifi is all well.\n\nNow, let get to the problem I have with Google Wifi - personally, I feel like they are taking it for granted that buyers are going to place this thing closely to one another and spread them all over the house so they decided to make each one of these units very much below average when comparing to traditional single Wifi rounter out there. I have a 4300sf house, 3 floors, basement and a sunroom in the back. It might seems like a big house and a lot of people would think I definitely need Mesh network. I thought so too. Well, it turns out that because my house has 3 floors, the rooms are kind of clumped together and for the most part, Wifi signal really only needs to cross either the wall or the ceiling or the floor to get to most of the house. I'm sure if it was a 1 story ranch house, I definitely needed to hardwire the whole house many years ago. Anyhow, I have a Linksys WRT 1900 AC and we have great connection through out the house with the exception of only 2 bars of signal in the sunroom and 0 bar of signal in the basement. (remember, this is a single unit Wifi router so my performance really is correlated with how many bar of signal I get).I decided to get myself the Google Wifi and test it out. The set up part was super easy. I give them credit for that. However, as many have mentioned, you can't not customized much in here. I also miss the fact that we no longer can attach a USB drive into the Wifi router to create our own network storage (it was so easy to share files between computers this way and also backing up important files from whichever computer you would like to do your work at the time. I'm sure there are ways to solve this problem but plugging a harddrive directly to the router via USB is still the cheapest and easiest way). Regarding signal strength, I placed Main unit in the master bedroom on 2nd floor, another unit on the same floor and 1 more unit on the 1st floor. I now get signal in basement (2 bar) which I don't understand why when I have 1 unit sitting literally just 1 floor above me. Because of that unit on the 1st floor, I now get signal outside in the sunroom but it was fluctuating between 2-3 bars. With the main unit sits toward one side of the house on the 2nd level, I tried to move the 2nd unit on that level as far as I can get without loosing much performance and that's when i realized that these unit on their own is very weak. My feel is each one of them only cover 1/2 the coverage I normally would get from Linksys WRT 1900 AC. So there we go, having 3 units is like a sale strategy to make people that this is a great deal. Each one of them is semi-horrible to lower the cost - a classic WIN-WIN strategy. They should have thought less of marketing, just make 2 really good routers and extend people's Wifi out the proper way, still charge the same amount and give it time so people can see how well the product really is. That is how to earn the long lasting reputation. Maybe next round, Google. I hope you guys read and learn."}

I read it was an issue with the buffers, so I waited for a firmware update and none never came. I decided to finally replace it after a year of my wife giving me dirty looks every time she start having connection issue. The worse was the connection issues on locally attached devices. I did not want to make the mistake again so I starting looking a bunch of this newer wireless only routers. I finally decided on the Google Wifi system. I have been in IT for more years than I want to admit. I love this system.\n\nPros:\n\nFirst off, the boxing was that of Apple levels. It was beautifully done and made you feel like someone cared about the product. The devices themselves look amazing. They have a LED night in the center band that you can changed the brightness on. I have one in my son's room and he uses it as his night light. It is really a nice touch. Only one need to be connected to the internet by hard wire, the others will create a Mesh network between themselves. I love the APP that is used to manage and configure them. I had the first up in about 10 minutes and the other two 15 minutes later. So I had everything working in 30 minutes and that includes the App download. You could say because of my IT background that it is just me, but it is very simple to setup. The App walks you through it completely. The app has the ability for you to setup timers on devices to pause them at certain time frames or manually on the fly. So if you want to have a bedtime for your kids and shut it down, you can shut it down at a certain time. I have manually shutdown people when they are consuming to much bandwidth. I have only a 6MB DSL connection, the fastest I can get, Thanks AT&T. So I have to be the bad man that watching it to make sure that no one is killing everyone else over something stupid. My son-in-law is famous for watching YouTube on 1080p and then complains about it pausing. I can now see what every device is consuming in real time, which is awesome!\n\nCons:\n\nI have gotten around the cons, but they are the reason for the one star loss. You can not edit the IP network, it is defaulted to 192.168.86.0 and that is fixed, you cannot be change it. This was very annoying because I have things like my Wireless Printer, Security Video Recorder, and Media server that are hard coded. I had to switch them all to DHCP, get an IP address on the new network and then go into the App to do a DHCP reservation for the device. Not a big deal but caused me a lot of work to change the IP address and reconfigure the devices that connect to them. It was about 30 minutes of extra work, again not a big deal but annoying. It is just lacking in a lot of advanced features that a small group of us use and are available in most other Routers.\n\nOverall:\n\nI love it and I would definitely suggest it to anyone that is looking for a home WIFI unit. I would not suggest for a business as I saw in the forums. It is not built for a business in mind. It is built for the consumer. It just needs one or two more advance features for it to be perfect!"}

Yes, the app is the only way to set up your system or change router settings. What I like is that I can access these settings from anywhere, see current data usage from anywhere, and even restart the system or just a single node. Google always does a nice job with apps IMO and this app is no different, it's clean and easy to use.\n- The system has yet to cause me problems. After installing 2 Wifi points in my 800 square foot apartment (2 stories) I haven't had to think about it since. The only changes I have made since installing are to add OpenDNS as an internet filter and to decrease the brightness of the router point in my bedroom.\n\nI enjoy not having to worry about my Wifi anymore. Having that has made this purchase worth it. Internet should not be a hassle to deal with, and Google Wifi makes sure that's the case.\n\nOther comments: I have this router coupled with a TP-Link DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem using Comcast's XFINITY service. I am paying for 55 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up. Using Google Wifi's built-in speed test, I routinely get 63 Mbps down and 5.6 Mbps up, and with an online test (like speedtest.net) I get the same speeds on BOTH nodes. For my setup, there is no speed decrease when I am connected to my bedroom point vs the living room point (the one connected to the modem)."}

First off, I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought I might have to go in and configure a number of settings in my router, which can be a pain in the butt. However, what I got was so simple, I'm still in a bit of shock.\n\nThe system works beautifully creating a WiFi mesh network, extending my router speed across the entire house and basement. In a nutshell you take the first Google WiFi router, plug it into one of the regular Ethernet ports, activate it within the Google WiFi app (via scanning the QR code), then put the location of the second one, plug it in, enable it within the app (via scanning), and repeat the same for the last one. Each of the mini Google WiFi extenders will speak with each other passing data throughout the house AND allow you to plug devices into both of their ethernet ports on the extenders.\n\nSo for example, I plugged my PS4 in the basement into the WiFi extenders via an Ethernet cord. Which gave me much faster speeds than through my normal WiFi connection. The same went for my computer in my office and the Tivo Mini. I guess you can say that the wireless data speed on the mesh network is so fast that its like plugging my devices into a virtual ethernet cord.\n\nTo give you a couple comparisons, I'm paying for 50mbps Verizon Fios. My PS4 went from around a 15 mbps WiFi connection in my basement to 46mbps connection when I plugged it into the Google WiFi extender. My desktop computer in the office was using one of those TP Link plug-in ethernet extenders and went from 11mbps (crappy house wiring) to 45mbps via Google WiFi extender. I'm not sure what speed my Tivo Mini was running on, but it's probably around the same speed. I have had issues in the past where it would skip during playback or while watching live tv through it if the connection speed wasn't fast enough, but that doesn't appear to be an issue with Google WiFi.\n\nIt should also be noted that even though this system makes it's own super fast network, the existing networks created by my Verizon Fios router are still active. So it's like having 3 networks in my home. I should probably shut those down, but I don't think they're hurting anything."}

It would have required that I \"bypass\" our FIOS modem/router (i.e. turn off the router's WiFi and DHCP) in order to set up the Google Primary node as the router for all my devices, and because I prefer to use static IPs it became a real headache. One is supposedly able to set up port forwarding on the Google device, but I just found it too complicated and time-consuming to get it to work with our system and I lost patience.\n\nI also have to agree with a number of Internet reviews -- it was extremely frustrating to have such limited access to the Google router settings. For instance, had I been able to adjust the IP preferences to match those of my FIOS router, I could have avoided changing all the static IPs on my devices.\n\nEven with the frustration I give this system high marks because it was easy to set up and did improve WiFi coverage, pretty much as advertised."}

In about 30 minutes i was done and an initial speed test that the application on my Nexus 6p android phone showed we had stable bandwidth all over the house at significantly greater speeds. The other part was stability of the signal. Before we had these modem issues where the internet would slow and we had to reset the modem or fiddle with all the powerline devices.

On top of that, the system is rock solid and stable-- a consistent and powerful signal wherever I need it. I have gigabit service and wifi speeds are consistently 50MB download (though quite a bit slower upload) at most usable distances. Within a few feet of the router, I am topping 400MB!\n\nNot sure why it did not impress me at first. My only thought is that the system may take some time to configure how it connects itself to create the mesh.\n\nVery impressed now.\n\n++++++++++++++\n\nI like it but don't love it after a few days of use.\n\nPurchased Fios gigabit service-- which has been a huge disappointment because the only place you can get giga speed is right at the verizon modem. My house is wired with cat5 however cat5e is the protocol which provides reliable gigabit service. Best I could do on a hard wired setup was about 150 MB. WiFi is also not as robust--but I figured that mesh networking is the latest and greatest and worth a try.\n\nVery easy to set up, application is simple and quick-- I had the three wifi points included in the box up and working in a few minutes. One plugs into your cable modem's WAN port (generally a yellow outlet) with the included patch cord. The other two units are placed about a room or so away from each other to provide an area of consistent coverage.\n\nSo it works. However the blazing fast gig speed is only available in a small circle around the hardwired unit plugged into the cable modem. The network is solid and fairly large throughout my house however speed at any of the other units drops off significantly and is only about 50MB or so generally.\n\nNow 50MB is substantially enough to do anything you want including streaming videos--however, I was looking to spread gig speed throughout the house and this device will not do that.\n\nI do have an Archer TP 7 wifi which is really substantially stronger and costs less than $100 bucks. Comparatively, the google wifi units provide a slightly more consistent field but over a lesser area. I can pick up a usable wifi signal from the TP7 more than 150 feet away-- at a point where the signal from the three google units are not even showing up on my device.\n\nSO... perfectly usable and lovely looking google wifi is neat and works-- but doesn't do much more than a cheaper but much more powerful regular modem.\n\nYou would think that all of this would be second nature by now-- strong wifi wherever you need it doesn't sound like asking too much if you are willing to pay. However, it is not as simple as it looks and this device isn't pushing any envelopes in my humble opinion."}

So basically none of my home devices including my smarthome products, sonos speakers would not be accessible by anything on my wireless subnet. Double NATing causes all kinds of chaos in my home and I dont get how not giving the end user the ability to not to incorporate this into an existing home network (on the same subnet) is not an option. In disbelief I called technical support to see if there was something I was missing. They confirmed that their system would not integrate into my LANs existing subnet.

{"Author": "lindguini", "Date": "on August 3, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Wi-fi problem solved. Period.", "Text": "We have a 1940's-era home with 6-inch thick, lathe-and-plaster walls. Only 1200 sq. feet total. No wi-fi setup has ever completely resolved the weak/intermittent wi-fi in various areas of this small floor plan. We've struggled for years to build the \"perfect\" home wi-fi setup using routers, power line Ethernet adapters, and range extenders. The centerpiece of our latest system was an AC1900 router with three giant antennas sprouting from a similarly huge, shiny black slab of plastic with a multi-colored light show of LEDs across its width. Simply ugly but that's the price you pay for coverage --less than perfect coverage, at that. Plus, with these systems, you're forced to maintain two separate SSIDs for the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, requiring you to manually select which devices you want to connect to each band. In a house with 15 or more connected devices, this band selection becomes old very quickly. These inconveniences would probably be more tolerable if it weren't for the random, wi-fi disconnects and system lock-ups that require routine re-booting of routers and other components, in hopes of bringing stability back for, oh please, even one more day.\n\nThat was life before Google Wifi.\n\nGoogle Wifi was my last hope. After disconnecting the half dozen components of our old system, I followed Google's easy setup instructions (download the app to your phone) and setup the first (primary) Wifi point in our back bedroom where the cable modem is located. Within 10 minutes, the first point completed its self-setup and was online. The app then asks if you want to setup more Wifi points. I located the next one at the other end of the house in the living room and just plugged it in to wall power. In a couple minutes, Google reported the second point up and running. I installed the third point in our laundry room in hopes of finally getting coverage in kitchen/bathroom area that had never worked well in the past. Two minutes later, the third and final Wifi point was running and the mesh was complete. The mesh reported perfect connection between all points without any signal degradation. Yes, I did experiment with just two Wifi points to see if those could provide full coverage but the weak signal in the kitchen/bathroom area dictated installing the third point in the adjacent laundry room. So, in older houses like this, you'll do best to install a full three point mesh for the best overlap and coverage. Plus, the 3-pack is a very good deal compared to purchasing two at full price.\n\nRunning Speedtest at every location in the house now results in full internet speed (60-70 Mbps download). Band switching between 2.4 and 5 GHz is fully automatic and devices remain solidly connected as you travel throughout the house, seamlessly switching from one mesh point to the next to maintain the strongest signal. Best of all, the Google Wifi points are small and unobtrusive, easily placed anywhere that's convenient and within reach of a power outlet. Plus, the Google Wifi app is extremely easy to use and affords you control over the entire system, including the ability to switch off access to any device, monitor device activity in real-time, and even control the brightness of the LED status ring on each point --all from your phone no matter where you are in the world.\n\nAfter several weeks of Google Wifi bliss, we've had no disconnects, dropped signals, or mysterious behavior. It just works. Always. Thanks, Google."}

It only took me about 15 minutes to get them up and running, the lights on them are completely adjustable (either brighter or dimmer/off) which was great since we have one in our bedroom and didn't want a night-light keeping us up. My network speed tests went from 25 Mbps to 65 Mbps. And the 2 additional Ethernet ports meant I could directly connect my desktop computer to the mesh network without needing a WiFi dongle/card. It works great and I have no complaints. Now I am upgrading my cable modem to get even more out of my internet speeds since this one provides more than enough bandwidth to watch movies, stream Steam games from upstairs to the TV downstairs, and have numerous small devices connected at the same time. No issues with Mac/Android or buffering problems with YouTube/Facebook. Everything just works right out of the box, plus it maintains itself. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this router setup, it's truly the future of WiFi!"}

But if you want to do anything outside of that there are no features to support it. I just spent 2 hours with support to find out that the router just can't do... well.... pretty much anything.\n\nIf you have wired devices you'll need another router and suddenly you run into the double nat problem which means nothing on your wireless network can reach your wired network.\n\nThere is no logging, security, monitoring or pretty much ability to configure anything at all. Even the things it SAYS you can configure are grayed out and you can't edit them.\n\nWhen you plug them into a wired network, expect them to flood the network badly enough that all of your other devices will shut down and be unable to run.\n\nIf the power goes out or they get unplugged for some reason. Plan out 2-3 hours ahead of time to reboot, reset to factory defaults... etc over and over again until they come back online\n\nand note, with the lack of features they are MORE expensive than other routers."}

I am quite happy now with Google WiFi - but it has been a journey. It has taken almost a month for my ISP to troubleshoot and correct the problem that prevented the initial installation from completing. Something in the ISP's network was being cached and they were not able to assign an IP Address to the main Google WiFi router (one of three). Google support was very knowledgeable, but the problem needed to be solved by my ISP by opening up a 2nd port on my FiberBox that had never had a router previously connected. Since I have swapped routers successfully many times before moving to Google WiFi, I am speculating that the fault might be with the Google WiFi design but could be exclusively with my ISP - hence only 4 stars.\nNow that it works I get a strong signal all over the entire 3 floors and much faster connection for NetFlix and Amazon Prime video streaming."}
{"Author": "Jeff R.", "Date": "on August 1, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "The most graceful home wifi solution on the market.", "Text": "We've been struggling with wifi in our single family home for almost two years now using the cheap router provided by the ISP. Even just 30-50ft away from the router we'd have issues with low signal strength, buffering, and drops. We pay for 150Mbps and get just that with a wired connection but would only get 20-40Mbps via wifi even when standing directly next to the router.\n\nI debated purchasing a better single router but the new mesh technology seemed like a good way to put our wifi woes to rest permanently. Even though it may be a bit of overkill for our sub-2000sf home I purchased the three router pack to ensure we could get full coverage in our backyard and second floor.\n\nMy first reaction: WOW! We're getting full signal throughout the house and backyard now but more importantly we're getting almost the entire 150Mbps via wifi now. Multiple devices streaming at once on wifi are no problem. I notice no speed drops as it hands off between access points. Just consistently fast coverage everywhere. I didn't realize just how used to slower wifi speeds I'd become until I started using this system.\n\nAdditionally, and I know it's subjective, but the devices are very attractive and match the current understated design philosophy of so many newer consumer electronics. Unlike many other routers out there whose design screams EXTREME SPEED! these are meant to look at home in your decor. No need to cram them in the utility closet. They also feel very sturdy and well made. The comparisons to white hockey pucks are apt.\n\nIt's already been stated many times but the setup is as effortless as advertised. I'm confident that even the least computer savvy users could have these up and running in minutes using the very well designed app.\n\nI would recommend these to anyone struggling with home wifi coverage or network slowness. The difference is amazing and the cost compared to comparable systems is fantastic. I'm very pleased with the purchase!"}

In fact, with my set-up Frontier was running both internet and tv through the same coax cable. I wanted better control of my WiFi network, and I was also interest in the mesh technology of this product. However, due to my setup there were a lot of things I had to change. First off, I had to run a Cat5 cable from my router to the ONT box in the garage. Then I had to contact Frontier and have them change the ONT box (remotely) so that internet went through the Cat5 and tv went through the coax. They also needed to implement a Moca connection within the ONT.\n\nAfter that I logged into my Actiontec router, turned off the wifi broadcast and released the IP address. The Google Wifi took over the ethernet connection, got set up, and now the Actiontec sits behind the Google Wifi and is basically just a bridge making sure that my tv programming and on-demand stuff gets pushed to the cablebox. That set up isn't supported by Frontier, but that's the only way to get the Google WiFi system to operate correctly as a mesh network. There were a couple more steps involved, but that's the basic idea.\n\nI love the functionality of this router and being able to turn off wifi to my kids' devices on a schedule (or at whim). The guest network was also a breeze to set up. I'm only using two units right now, but I have significantly more coverage than I used to."}

I truly wish I had known about the Google Wifi System a long time ago! This has been such a lifesaver for us! It's easy to set up, comes with 3 Wifi mesh devices which is perfect for our house square footage, delivers great Wifi signal and lives up to all the positive reviews!

Have been plagued with slow wifi connections, dead spots etc. in my small, 1200-sq.ft apartment for a couple of years now. My ISP provides a consistent 200 mbps connection . So I knew it had to be the wifi router but hesitated to make the switch because my old router too was a branded, dual band one.\n\nAnyway, finally I took the plunge - and am I delighted! The set up is a breeze and is very transparent - all you need is an android/apple phone. In addition to helping you set up the connections the phone app also gives you a clear picture of the devices connected, how many are active, which one to give preference to (if needed) etc.\n\nJust so you know - you can only connect one additional device to the main (base) router and 2 (max) to the additional satellite extenders. So If you have many wired connections, you may want to purchase an Ethernet splitter. Very effective, inexpensive ones are available in Amazon - TP Link recommended. So I do not think of this as a con at all.\n\nThe overall connection is Your Existing Modem to Google Wifi Router (base) to Ethernet Splitter to Your Wired Connection Devices.\n\nOh btw, against my 200mbps connection from the ISP, I am getting ~170Mbps signal strength on all my wifi connected devices (per speedtest.net by Ookla).\n\nI highly recommend the product.\n\nI know these are early days.

Highly Recommended.", "Text": "THE SITUATION\n\nMy wife and I loved everything about our new home, our first home, a 1,500sf two story townhouse with soaring ceilings and plenty of space to plan additions to our young family (we're thinking a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, first). What we didn't love was the pockets of slow internet that we found within areas of our home... areas like the kitchen and living room (downstairs from our router in the office), and master bathroom (at the other end of the house from the office).\n\nAn Airport Extreme router had served us well in our previous 900sf single level apartment but it was proving insufficient in our new space. I tried an Airport Express as a range extender but it mostly just made the network more confusing - deciding to jump on the 5ghz WiFi or 2.4ghz WiFi and which channel to choose within the settings (1? 6? 11?) to get the best speed. I'm the family Chief Technology Officer and the metrics weren't living up to expectations.\n\nThe final straw was when the wife's younger sister, freshly graduated from college, visited and asked from the living room \"Do y'all have WiFi in here or... nah?\" It was time for a router change.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nI'd heard of the benefits of a mesh network and thought it sounded like a good solution for our problem. Of the options available, I chose the Google Wifi because of it's less expensive cost, focus on whole home saturation, and ease of use. Like I said, I'm the CTO - I'm pretty tech savy - but I don't want to be troubleshooting frequently (or ever, really) and we're pretty simple in our requests. Make it fast enough, everywhere.\n\nThe setup for the Google Wifi took maybe ten minutes with another handful of minutes for each of the additional pucks. I won't explain the process, but trust me: the Google Wifi App does a great job of walking you through it and making it pretty dummy proof. I replaced the Airport Extreme router in our office with a Google Wifi puck and added the second in our master bedroom (above our kitchen) and the third in our living room downstairs (with sight-line to the kitchen).\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nI won't bury the lede: Google Wifi increased the speeds in our house by 146% on average, with a range of 115Mbps down in the office (our wired router) to 40Mbps down in the kitchen (our previous most-dead zone that sputtered at 7Mbps). Our average jumped from 30Mbps down to more than 70Mbps down - about a 2.5x jump.\n\nI took three speed test measurements in five locations around the house with the old set-up and the new set-up, and compared their averages in those locations and as a whole for each router. My experience backs up those tests: no more cooking in the kitchen, trying to find the recipe on my phone and burning the pan while I turn off WiFi to get a stronger LTE signal. Streaming video on our living room TV is stronger and I move seamlessly throughout the house at speeds fast enough to stream 4k.\n\nThe hardest part of the switch was getting my Sonos reconnected, and that took about twenty minutes of back and forth (unplug your Sonos speakers for five seconds when you switch routers - it resets their IP address). It hasn't been long that we've had the Google WiFi but we're loving the immediate improvement. Increased speeds, no dead zones, and super easy to set-up and operate.\n\nHighly recommended."}

{"Author": "CCCCW", "Date": "on July 27, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "VERY SENSITIVE to Placement / Location. Here are some TIPs:", "Text": "All wifi units are sensitive to where you put them in your house, but even more so when you are creating a \"mesh\" network. When I first installed them, I was only getting about 40 mbps download speed all over the house. That went up to between 80-200+ mbps all over the house by moving them around to different locations and finding the best spots. That's fairly easy to do since only one has to be connected to your incoming modem, and the others can be plugged in anywhere.\n\nOnce you plug them all in and have internet (only takes a few minutes), then you can click a simple \"Test Mesh\" button in the app, and it will tell you Great/Good/OK/Poor for the connection between each, and if you need them closer to each other etc. Once you have a good connection between the Mesh, you need to find the final exact location by checking your speed when you're standing next to each unit (so you'll be connected to that specific unit). You can simply stand next to a unit, run a speed test via the browser on your phone, and then move the unit and run it again to find the best spot for each one. I had a great \"Mesh\" connection, but just OK speed until I moved the units to the right spot.\n\nMy big issue is that my internet comes into my house at a modem in a closet at the far end of my house. I ended up drilling a small hole through the drywall up high from the closet into the hallway on the other side, and ran the main unit's small power and ethernet cable through the wall and into the open hallway on the other side of the closet. I bought a small floating wall shelf, mounted it about 6.5' up the wall where I drilled the hole, and set the unit there. Looks very clean / small white shelf / the unit looks cool and can't see the hole because the unit is in front of it. I did the same with a white cube shelves to set the other two on in the other rooms. Getting the MAIN UNIT out of the far closet into an open space brought all the units up from 30-40 mbps to 80-200+ mbps near the main unit. You can also simply set them on a counter, dresser, table, shelf, whatever. But moving each of them to an open location- sometimes just a foot or two over to avoid a wall, made a huge difference.\n\nAgree with most of the comments here- super easy to use, simple, no hassle operation and set up. We have tons of things connected from our TV/Receiver/DIrect TV box to many computers, phones, Sonos and other wireless devices, and a vpn, and everything connected immediately when we switched over to the Google wifi. (Sonos does require you to unplug and restart to getting connected to Google wifi, actually Sonos requires that whenever you want to connect it to a new network/ new wifi) The Google wifi the app is great because you can reset everything and refresh in jut a couple taps, test your internet connection, and test your connection between the three units with just a tap. And it will tell you Great/Good/OK/Poor for the connection between each, and if you need them closer etc. Most important, solved all my problems with a simple to use system that just works for everything, no more hassles."}

This was my first mesh network install of its kind. I used to have the crappy router that came with the cable service. Then I tried the Apple Airport Extreme. Recently, I purchased this system.\n\nThe problem with Apple is that they are clearly no longer interested in being in the WiFi business. Their app is lame, as usual they'd rather present the illusion of simple, when in reality the cost of that is functionality. Speaking of cost, as an Apple product it is outdated and overpriced. And I say all this as an Apple fan with two MacBook Airs, a MacBook Pro, two new touch bar MacBook Pros, an iPad, an iPad Pro, an Apple Watch, and four Apple TVs in the house.\n\nSo I just replaced my old Apple network which had a full sized base station and a repeater, with a three piece mesh system by Google.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the system, is that there is only one physical ethernet port on the device. Previously I had my primary Apple TV, PS4 and smart TV all hardwired for better streaming and access. And I had a Philips Hue hub attached to both the base unit and the upstairs repeater. With the Google system I had to drop down to having only one connection, which had to be the Hue.\n\nI was concerned about lagging on the PS4 for gaming, and streaming speeds. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I can stream in 4K without issue. I can play Call of Duty at Master Prestige level without any noticeable change in gaming experience. I have four Nest security cameras around the outside of my home and they now stream far more reliability, the network coverage being stronger, they don't drop off the network from time to time like they used to.\n\nWhen streaming Spotify at max bit rate my Bose SoundTouch 30 did pause once, but there is a very good chance that was either my ISP or Spotify itself. Because I have had no other network issues, with 30 devices on the network.\n\nI like the mesh concept. I think the units are attractive.

{"Author": "Marty B", "Date": "on July 24, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Day One Experience with Google WiFi", "Text": "Day One: Loving it... I have a two story home and use Comcast for my internet service provider. They provide a single modem / router which reaches most of my home pretty well. It is located upstairs in a front room of my home. Unfortunately, it doesn't do a tremendous job of reaching my downstairs office and is spotty in my back yard. I like to listen to my Sonos system when I'm by my swimming pool and it's always a 50-50 proposition if my phone can stay connected to my home network to control the Sonos. Occasionally, when I run backups, my backup program tells me that I have lost connection to the network drive. I have tried a couple of TP-Link range extenders and they help, but not overwhelmingly.\n\nAfter reading a TheWireCutter article on mesh networking products, I decided to try Google's WiFi system. WireCutter actually recommended Netgear's Orbi, but as I read their review and others, I concluded that the Orbi really isn't mesh at all..... it's just a really really strong WiFi router and repeater. I'm sure it works fine, but it is more money than Google's product and I wanted to try a true mesh network.\n\nI set the Google WiFi up this morning. It took about ten minutes to put all three units in play. I think it took longer for me to come up with a clever name for my new home network than to physically install the units. The app for the system is very easy to follow, in true Google fashion.\n\nI tested the WiFi signal throughout my house and compared it to my still functioning Comcast WiFi signal. Outstanding! In places where my old signal was wimpy, the Google system was pumping out a strong clear signal that permeated places in my back yard yet unseen by WiFi. Very impressive.\n\nNext: the fun part--- reconnecting everything in the house to the new WiFi connection and new network. I have a 26 port network switch which connect my two network attached storage drives, my television and DVD player and my beloved Sonos bridge. I ran an ethernet cable from the 2nd port on the main Google unit to the switch and hoped that it would instantly allow access to everything. Nope... everything still expected to be connected to the original network. So, I disconnected cable running from the Comcast router to the switch, waited a few minutes and then checked. That was all I needed to do for those devices to connect - just give the switch ONE connection the network running through the Google router.\n\nThe next issue I encountered was that my Sonos system would run fine from my PC, but not from my android phone or tablet. In fact, it caused an issue where my phone and tablet would connect to my Google network, then disconnect, then reconnect. I couldn't get my Sonos app to control anything. I called Google's support line for this WiFi system to see if they could help. They gave me some good advice:\n\n- first, don't expect everything on your network to instantly recognize everything else. I've noticed in the past when I connect network devices, like NAS drives, they don't always connect for a few minutes. Sean, from Google support said that things might take a day or two to be fully integrated.\n\n- second, when something isn't quite right, power down your modem and your Google WiFi router - the one connected to your modem. Wait five minutes and then restart your modem. Give that about three or four minutes to fully come back to life, then power on your WiFi again. That can take a minute or so to fully reboot. When I did this, my Sonos system was fine and was fully controllable by my android apps.\n\nSo, it's still early in the game, but I now have a really strong WiFi signal throughout my 3350 square foot house. I have a very good WiFi signal out by my pool. My network backups appear to be running much quicker and complete without interruption. I'll update this as things progress, but on Day One, everything seems to be better, faster and running just great."}

The very nice support people said that if I have to buy it from the U.K. - otherwise it would be only 110 V.\nMoreover, the support people advised me not to buy it at all, from 2 reasons: 1. It might not support the WiFi in my country. 2. Google doesn't give any support in Israel. Why I still decided to buy? Since I didn't believe that could be a WiFi problem (it is not so difficult to check, there are specs of the router, the support is quite universal). Moreover - I checked that I can download the app from the Play Store for my Android phone, About the voltage I also had heavy doubts about the information I got, but anyway there are voltage transformers available on the market...At the other hand, The triple mesh router is much more expensive to buy from U.K. (Amazon).\nConclusion: 1. The U.S.A. product comes with adaptive voltage (110-240). Only the plug is different, one plug adapter costs $2.5.\n2. There was no need for any support to configure the 3 routers: I downloaded the App and followed the step-by-step instructions.\n3. It works like a charm.\n4.

For whatever reason, my Smart TV and other streaming devices no longer suffer from constant buffering. My Yamaha Music Cast audio system now works like a dream, especially notable when you are linking multiple Music Cast devices in separate rooms. Simply put, mesh seems to handle streaming and hand-off between multiple wifi points better than the range extenders did.\n\nI have 3 floors in my home, so I have one wifi router on each floor of an approximately 3,000 square-foot home.\n\nMy only complaint is that my old wireless printer is not compatible with the wifi on the mesh routers, but it's not a big deal. It is now a wired printer plugged directly into one of the two available LAN ports on the wifi router sitting in my office on the third floor. Problem solved!\n\nSetup was incredibly easy with the Google wifi app for Android, and I appreciate the ability to add multiple \"managers\" of the wifi network as well as configure a guest network for visitors. If you are thinking of taking the plunge on a mesh wifi network, this is the way to go!

I don't know why but we have had a string of portable dirt sucking machines that never held a battery charge. And consequently didn't suck. Which, ironically, did.\n\nI also possess an infernal wireless network that was eternally disconnecting from the Interwebs, leaving me with three woman and no access to Netflix, Hulu or online Solitaire. That's an Estrogen Tornado you don't want to get close to.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I rebooted the router.\nOr updated the firmware.\nOr ran around the house plugging and unplugging Airport Extremes, Airport Expresses and Apple Time Capsules, hoping to sooth a flashing amber light and woo it back to the green.\n\nNor can I calculate the amount of time spent on the phone with Apple Genii, Chad, Jeremy, or Crystal, reconfiguring the ethernet connections, rearranging the WAN and LAN ports, and reconfabulating the Java-scripted, HTML-based, hyper flick flacks.\n\nLast week, I thought I had figured it all all when I relocated one of the network extenders to the crawl space under the house for a perfectly triangulated arrangement guaranteeing maximum coverage.\n\nThe lights were green for THREE consecutive days. A record in my house. And then...\n\n\"Dad, the internet went out. I was right in the middle of Game of Thrones!\"\n\nThat was the digital straw that broke the router's back.\n\nTo hell with you Apple, I thought. And went and bought myself the new Google Wifi, a new mesh type network that promises better dependability, easier operation and a stronger connection throughout the entire household.\n\nEven to our detached garage, where you will find boxes of discarded toaster ovens and dustbusters.\n\nI connected the first Google Wifi point to the modem and it lit up immediately. I unplugged the SIX Apple network extenders and replaced them with TWO new Google cylinders, which are not only pleasing to the eye but incredibly efficient.\n\nThere was a bit of trial and error, but within 10 minutes, I had the system up and running. And it's still running. With not one outtage.\n\nMoreover, with a handy dandy iPhone app (oh the irony) I can monitor its performance and even redirect stronger coverage to certain devices.\n\nSo the days of listening to my daughter's whine about the shitty connection in my house are over. Dear Google, I would have easily paid twice the price for your incredible product.\n\nAll of which makes an interesting point about consumer behavior.\n\nPeople aren't loyal to brands.\nThey're loyal to brands who put out out better products."}

I wanted to get a better wifi signal at the far end of the house, and I thought this setup would do the trick. One the the wifi points needs to be physically connected to the modem as a base unit. But when I set up the satellite wifi points at the far end of the house, I got a message on the app that the signal was less than ideal and I should move the wifi points closer to the base unit, preferably within 30 feet. To make this possible, I would have to move and reconnect the modem in the center of the house. I bought this with the intent of easily boosting my wifi signal, but my adjusting to the needs of the system turns out to be much more of a hassle than is worth it in my case. So I am returning the system and will probably invest in a single router with better range than the unit I have now.

I had opted into Luma in hopes that the little start up powered by Amazon would have the right combination of security and availability for me and my home. I really enjoyed the Luma setup but I kept dropping signal. It was a catch 22. One too many Luma and the mesh network starts hopping from one access point to the other and your network slows down, your iOT start to misbehave, and you don't know if you need more devices or less. I did that for six months and finally decided to try Google Wifi.\n\nSo happy I did! I placed the three Google Wifi mesh access points in the same spots where I had previously placed the Luma and now I have coverage throughout the entire home! These things are much more powerful as far as range and connectivity is concerned. Subsequently my speedtests went from 80 down / 60 up with Luma to 90 down / 90 up with Google Wifi.\n\nI also spent some time asking the Luma team about Transport Layer Security (TLS) and when it would come to their platform. Since they couldn't give me a date, and Google Wifi has it now, it made sense for me to switch. It really came down to this: Google is a powerhouse where it comes to resources by comparison to nearly any other Router provider. They have antivirus and antimalware teams ensuring that the routers are not hacked (Asus and Netgear anyone?) They are in the business of ensuring that we are online 24x7, and to that end Google Wifi delivers.\n\nIf you are concerned about Privacy, and you should be. Consider that the Google Wifi uses its own DNS servers instead of your ISP's, but you can alternatively use your ISP's DNS if you prefer, or any other (I recommend OpenDNS dot org) But having your traffic encrypted between your home and Google's DNS servers is a good start, by way of TLS.\n\nIf you have privacy needs, you may want to consider a VPN service, they can be had very reasonably these days.\n\nThe App is definitely \"basic\" you have all the necessary controls to get up and running and check network health, and perform some basic troubleshooting. Advanced networking geeks like me will pine for finer granularity and control of the network. Things like print servers and USB connections and Samba, all missing from present day configuration, will make us think twice about opting into Google Wifi.\n\nSo why did I do it? Because I'd like to just have excellent wifi throughout the house and go do something else this weekend besides toy with my network settings. Google consistently topped reviews throughout the web, and I give up trying to fight my googly overlords."}

Since installing, I'm getting around 250 throughout my entire home. Plus, as an added bonus, I can now control the devices within my home. I have a teenager that loves to sneak the tablet at night and stay up till all hours. No more! Momma will now be shutting down all devices at bedtime. And chores? No electronics until they're done! What kind of magic is this device??!! All I know is, I'm sold! So glad I decided to order this!"}

This is so incredibly easy to setup, nearly plug it in and magic. Love it!\n\nBefore Google Wifi:\n\nI have a two-story, 3 bedroom house and we had spotty to no coverage in one room and spotty wifi coverage in another room. Our Xfinity Comcast router/modem is in center of house on first floor. We have a 300Mbps plan so was disappointed when we weren't able to take advantage of its full potential, suffering from Netflix/Amazon buffering or not streaming in HD.\n\nNow with Google Wifi:\n\nEntire house has full signal strength and taking advantage of our 300Mbps bandwidth. Noticed a 3-5x boost in speed across our devices and TVs.\n\nIf you have a modem+router from your ISP, after getting your Google Wifi setup consider putting your original router into bridge mode (I can't share links in reviews, so use Google to search for \"google wifi bridge mode\"). Essentially that tells your modem/router combo box to operate as just a modem and not broadcast unnecessarily more wifi signals (the Google Wifi device is itself a router and broadcasts its own SSID). This alleviates some wifi channel interference and load on the modem/router combo box.\n\nYou do need a google account to use the mobile app for configuring your Google wifi points. If you don't want to use your personal gmail account then simply create a new one (they're free).\n\nI really liked that the Google Wifi app can help you position your other points by checking signal strength between them. At first I put one of the points on one side of my master bedroom but the app said it had moderate signal strength. I moved it to another side of the room to be a few feet closer to the main point/router and got better connectivity."}

My house is around 2400sqft, but with porches we're looking at over 3200sqst in total space that needs coverage. My house is wired perfectly for a MESH type system with 2 ethernet locations downstairs on either end and one upstairs in the middle of the house. I was looking at eero 1st gen because it seemed like a very Apple-like product and had great reviews, but was reading way too many negative comments how iphones would drop connection or the units needed to be restarted very often. I just couldn't pull the trigger on them.\n\nThe eero Gen 2 came out, so obviously I was interested, but the more I read about them, the less enthused I became. First of all, with my house all wired, I didn't want to get the beacon units which have no ethernet ports. I wanted everything hardwired, so the price is $499. I started to compare it with Google WIFI which I was able to get here for $269. With my research, I realized the new EERO was overkill. Like the tri-band is useless since all my units would be wired. I also kept reading the same old issues with iphones dropping, or the units running hot, no support IPv6 (yet?). Add that with the cost difference, I realized Google Wifi was all I really needed.\n\nWe have 2 nests, 2 iphones, 1 ipad, 2 macbooks, apple tv, ps4, 1 printer, raspberry pi, alexa dot, 2 kindles. I'm sure I am missing something else.... but every single one of them connects easily to my google wifi. I seriously love it. It's really cool to see how the Nest upstairs is connected to the mesh upstairs. And how I can walk around my house with my iphone and the connection bounces from unit to unit without dropping. It's amazing.\n\nIt's a very easy setup. The speeds have been great. I really think Google Wifi offers enough for most people, especially if your house is wired.\n\nSome comments: Set up all the units in the same room, then bring them to the locations you want them to be in. They will automatically recognize the ethernet once you plug them in.\n\nAlso, my fios speed is 300/300. The google wifi app says my internet is fast at 200/200 every time. It doesn't seem to give an exact reading, but when I use the speedtest app I get better numbers closer and sometimes above my 300 speed."}

The router has been for lack of a better term, a turd. If you want to have everything hardwired in, it works perfectly. We can see as high as 43mbps to as low as 30mbps. What we pay for is 40mbps. Not amazing, but does all that I need it to do. So as for hardwired, we are within the ballpark and I am happy. Now as for as the wifi, we typically were getting around 3-10mbps through our miscellaneous wifi gobblers. Not good, but again, it gets the job done if a few of us are using it. The downside is, between the wife, kids and I, we are techies and our electronics show it. You name it, we probably have it. So the wifi is important to us. Just a few weeks ago, all of a sudden the wifi stops working. We would have to be standing right next to it to get a feed, and even that was spotty. Believe me when I say it is a funny site to see when your household is standing around your router like a movie version of a bum standing next to a trashcan fire. (sorry to the people that need the warmth, but in this instance it is funny. First world problems right?) After several hours on hold, and a few minutes with tech. support, they concluded that the wifi was shot and I needed to buy another router. Well, I didn't want to give Centurylink any more money than I already had, so I started shopping around. That is where this little beauty caught my eye. I had yet to hear about a mesh system (my techy brain was on other tech I guess) and thought it might be worth giving a shot. One of the best features was the ability to kill wifi to people at will. I am not a devious man, but I can be if the rules aren't being followed by a very stubborn child. Or if I feel inclined, I can give it out like Oprah. You get wifi, and you get wifi, and you get wifi........... Oh, sorry I am getting distracted. So as far as the wifi is concerned, simply put, it works. The app you use to set it up has the ability to test wherever you are standing to tell you whether the signal is bad to great. In a 1500sqft (3bdrm/2bath) home, I get signal throughout. Every inch. Not just 3-10mbps, nope, but 30-38mbps. It has yet to drop below 30, which is AHmazing. I can now use my tablet in bed and not have a slow moment. Previously it was spotty, or slow or spotty and slow. It seriously is like night and day at how quickly stuff pulls up. What is wonderful is, if I see that there is a gap that needs filled, I can buy another one of these and it will wirelessly connect each other, pushing my signal further creating a mesh system. We are currently in process of selling our home and finding another. So I look forward to see how this thing preforms in a bigger space. I will update later if we end up needing another one and review if and how the mesh system works. I do have one complaint and that would be the need to have an phone app to control it. (No one needs another app on there phone) So that makes it only available on smartphones. It would be nice to be able to set it up through your computer. Also one last thing, if it helps. It is the size of a traditional whiskey glass, and weight just about the same. Oh yeah, and if you didn't already know......... you need internet to make this work. I don't know why I need to say that as it is stated throughout this product, but lets be honest, if you didn't read those instructions, I am sure you aren't reading this either. Well, I hope this review helps someone. Thanks for reading."}

{"Author": "Dane Alexander O'Leary", "Date": "on July 10, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Most user-friendly mesh wifi system at a great price", "Text": "\u00bb TL;DR\nGoogle Wifi is, in my humble opinion, the most well-rounded, user-friendly mesh Wifi solution. The bang-for-buck is great, too. From what I've read and experienced, I'd say Google Wifi is best for those with homes that are roughly 3000 sq.ft. or smaller; if your home is larger than that, there some degradation in speed as you move further away from the main Google Wifi unit (the one attached to your modem). In that case, you may experience better results with something like the Orbi. But if you're someone who struggles with dead spots in your home, would like more consistent and reliable Wifi speeds, and/or would like some mid-level customization and control options for your wireless network, Google Wifi is definitely for you.\n\n\u00bb Full Review\nJust to give a little context, I have Comcast/Xfinity internet service (as well as their TV service) and have been on the 100Mbps plan. Until recently, I was using the modem/router combo that they leased to me. While I didn't really have any problems with their hardware, per say, I noticed that my internet speeds got a lot slower in parts of my house that were more than 30 or so feet from where the modem/router was located. Since we've slowly been making our house \"smart\" and would, therefore, be having more and more connected devices straining our wireless network, I decided to invest in a mesh system. As if on cue, Google announced the Google Wifi shortly after I decided to invest in a mesh network. I opted for the Google Wifi for a couple key reasons.\n\nFor one thing, I have immense trust in Google as a brand. Although I started out an iPhone user, I currently use both iOS and Android devices, and between the two I use Google services (i.e., Gmail, Google Drive, etc). So when Google released a wireless router that had mesh capabilities, it seemed like a no-brainer. Plus, the sub-$300 cost of a set of three Google Wifi routers felt like a better deal that paying more than that for two-device system from Orbi or the extremely high-cost Velop system.\n\nBefore pulling the trigger, I did my due diligence with research and watching reviews. I came to the conclusion that, although I was sacrificing some of the more advanced controls afforded by the Orbi as well as settling for fewer ethernet ports on the Google Wifi units, the cost and feature set of the Google Wifi fit my needs. To be clear, I didn't buy them from Amazon, although I would've if they'd been available through Amazon at the time; when I purchased the Google Wifi 3-unit package, Amazon wasn't selling them and every retailer was out of them. I happened to get lucky and was notified of limited stock becoming available within a day or two of joining the waitlist on Google's own website.\n\nMy home is 1900 sq.ft. Each Google Wifi unit purportedly covers 1500 sq.ft. Basically, this mean that I barely needed more than one unit for whole-home coverage. As I waited on the shipment to be delivered, I debated with myself whether or not I would go ahead and install all three or if I would just use two. When I received the 3-unit pack of Google Wifi, I eventually decided that I would only install two, so I sold the third one on eBay as a single for $100, bringing the total cost of my Google Wifi mesh system to $200 and making it even more attractive than it already was.\n\nSetup was a breeze and is probably one of Google Wifi's most shining moments. Basically, you download the Google Wifi app, plug one of the units (doesn't matter which) into your modem and a power outlet, and take a picture of the underside of the unit by following the prompts in the app. This last part allows the app to communicate with and setup the router. This process took only a minute or two.\n\nFrom there, the next steps involve setting up your network. Once that's complete, the app will ask if you have any additional units you'd like to install as satellites, which is how the mesh system works. From what I've read, you can have a total of eight units connected to one another to blanket your home in wifi. Obviously, the average person won't need anywhere near that many since eight units would be enough coverage for a 12,000 sq.ft. home.\n\nAfter everything is setup and working, you're good to go and can use your wifi network as you normally would. In addition to really loving how simply and quick the setup process was, I love all the capabilities that the app offers. You can conduct network, speed, and mesh tests from right there in the app. Plus, it keeps a log of those tests, which is nice for comparison sake.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Google Wifi doesn't offer some of the advanced features you'd get with Orbi. Plus, larger homes may notice a drop in speeds as you move further away from the primary Google Wifi unit (the one physically attached to your modem). For me, there's virtually no difference in speed between the main unit and the satellite, but I've read a lot of other reviews that said the Google Wifi units couldn't reach the full bandwidth that was available as they got further from the main unit; for what it's worth, these reviewers were usually in very large homes (4000 sq.ft. or more). For that reason, I'd say if you would need more than 3 Google Wifi units to fully cover your home, you may want to choose the Orbi or one of the other mesh systems.\n\nThe Google Wifi units only have two ethernet ports each, too. If you happen to need three units, you'll actually only have five ports to work with because one of them will be needed to connect the main unit to your modem. If you're someone with a lot of devices that need physical connections to a modem or router, you'll need to invest in a switch for more ports, or else you'd be better suited by the Orbi, which has three available ports at the main unit and four available ports on the satellite unit.\n\nIf you take a look at performance tests and comparisons, Google Wifi typically falls somewhere in the middle among mesh wifi systems. When it comes to raw power, the Orbi is a better option, but it tends to be more expensive and isn't quite as easy to setup. However, I'm actually getting about 115Mbps throughout my home, which is actually a bit faster than I'm supposed to be getting from my 100Mbps internet package. (Note: I don't attribute the \"extra\" speed to Google Wifi, but I appreciate that Google Wifi allows me to take full advantage of that extra speed I'm getting.)\n\nAlthough it's trivial, I want to mention that Google Wifi is an extremely attractive little router. It's extremely small, roughly the size of two hockey pucks stacked atop one another, and its minimalist design keeps it from being an eyesore. In fact, Google Wifi would look at-home in virtually anyone's home. And the LED visible through the ring around the center of the unit can be adjusted (via the app) to be dimmer or brighter.\n\n\u00bb Bottom Line\nI'm extremely pleased with my purchase of Google Wifi. The only issue I've had was once or twice when the main unit lost contact with the satellite unit. The first time it happened, I couldn't figure out how to get it working again so I reset the satellite unit and re-connected it like I did when I first setup Google Wifi. The second time it happened it was easier to fix; I simply pressed the little reset button on the back of the unit, waited for it to power cycle, and it started working again. Other than those two times, the only issues I've had with Google Wifi were times when there were Xfinity outages or power outages in my area, which aren't problems with Google Wifi.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend Google Wifi to anyone who wants more reliable, consistent wifi throughout his or her home. Whether you're getting just one unit or setting up multiple units, the process is extremely quick and painless. Plus, having some added controls (i.e., push-button control of your guest network, advanced networking with DNS, etc) is nice even if you don't plan on using them. It's worth noting, too, that even if Google Wifi doesn't offer a feature you'd like to have today, it's possible that it'll come sometime down the road via a software update, which seems to happen, more or less, monthly.\n\n[Note: The modem I'm using with Google Wifi is the ARRIS SURFboard SB6183.]\n\nIf you have any questions about Google Wifi, leave a comment and I'd be happen to answer them."}

Sure enough within 5-10 minutes, the wifi was up and running and they were both in shock. I have the 100mbs plan through my provider and I was getting those speeds and even exceeding those speeds. Speed test were done through multiple apps speed tests. Google WiFi has a built in speed test, which always comes back a bit high. Both techs recommended OOKLA Speed Test app. Though the results came back lower then Google's, the speeds still exceeded 100mbs.

If you try to set them up remote from each other, you will eventually encounter a fatal error, that will not go away no matter what you do, and you will have to do a system reset and start from scratch. Turn off any other WIFI you are replacing - it will interfere and make installation fail. And hallways are your friend. Installing these in hallways - while cosmetically less appealing - lets them broadcast into rooms with only one wall in the way, instead of multiple walls. When changing floors, stack them one above the other (as close to the same position on the two different floors). And least obviously, the cord position matters. Stretch out the power cords, and they will communicate more effectively with one another. Good luck!"}

I have the main hub in the basement plugged into the modem so all the wires and such stay nice and hidden. The other hubs are on the main floor and upstairs and we have full signal on all of our devices anywhere in the house. It also has enough range to get our entire property within useful range which is pretty good for a .4 acre lot, only the furthest corners are without reception. It was very easy to set up and works well with forwarding external traffic to my owncloud server. Would recommend to anybody with a decent sized house. Best thing over my old routers is I have not had to reboot it once due to dropped wifi."}

It lived up to the hype in spades. I live in an older home (25 yrs old) so the construction is a bit less WiFi signal friendly than newer homes, 2 story. I've had non-stop issues with signal and dropped connections since I've moved in. Gone through several Wireless routers/access points, different types and brands of wireless range extenders and continue to have to reboot equipment constantly. My AppleTVs were constantly losing connections even when the signal appeared strong. My theory is that when a wireless range extender lost connection, the AppleTV (or other device, Nest, laptop, etc.) would connect to the weak signal from the main router & then never reconnect to the extender. Even when the AppleTV was connected, it would take sometimes 15 min to start playing an HD movie. I've had the Google Wifi system now for almost a month and performance/signal is amazing. Have not had to reboot a single device, AppleTV is always connected and starts any HD movie in seconds (no buffering or lag). Nest and other devices never lose connection. Setup was amazingly simple and well guided for each wifi system device and the tools are fantastic."}

Just plug your Ethernet cable from the wall outlet directly into the primary Google WiFi point when the setup app on your phone or tablet prompts you about a modem. The catch, however, that even the Google support person couldn't figure out, is that you should \"open a web browser on your phone/tablet\" that should open a \"permissions/authorization login page\" from your Internet Service Provider that will lead to the approval of this new device (Google WiFi) on their (ISP) network. After that, setup was a snap!\n\nI'm sure setup at an apartment or other dwelling where you use a cable modem or even DSL is exactly according to Google's setup steps. Home fiber users, again, do NOT need a modem to connect their Google WiFi to.However, setup for this type of internet connection is not directly addressed by the Google WiFi app.\n\nOther than this small setup hiccup, Google WiFi was just as good or better than advertised! My household coverage has at least doubled with faster connection speeds than my old wireless-N router provided. I have a 100 Mbps connection and now I get at least 65 Mbps at the worst on the most extreme edges of my home. Rooms where the WiFi points are located are all receiving 90 Mbps plus! My old stand alone Linksys E3000 pushed out around 35 Mbps at best on my home's (2800 sq ft) outward edges."}

My new smart tv has constant buffering issues, which I believed the new wifi point would eliminate. The tv is a straight shot, around 10 feet from the wifi point. Smart phone and laptop right next to the wifi point also get no signal boost from the point.\n\nAll my devices are up to date. The wifi point did not add anything to the service from the OnHub. I tried out the Orbi, during the Google router melt-down. It worked well. I returned it and bought the wifi point because I had so much $ already invested in the OnHub, and Orbi is $$$$.

I ordered 6 of them for the house, as it's more or less a complicated shaped place, and coverage is challenging. When this is working, it's decent for speed, 'n' speed, versus what the price tag would suggest you'd be connected. But, let's discuss why it's a terrible product:\n\nThere is only one way to set this up: the google wifi app. You have to download it to your phone, and then it proceeds to be not that awesome from the draw. You can't do anything 'advanced' without severe challenges, and you literally have to search of the most simple things- like \"how do I change the name of this point? I just moved rooms, so now it's inaccurate.\"\n\nNow, let's talk 'advanced'- If you have a house protected with something decent like a hand-rolled solution, pf, pfsense, iptables, ipfw, etc.. you are going to have problems right off the bat. This thing is CONSTANTLY calling home to google, to the point where it's nearly all of your traffic in downtimes (and this is with 6 ecobees doing about the same). Now, the connection will stay alive periodically, but even when plugged directly into the hardware interface, and getting through a well secured home, it will only stay active for a few hours. Constantly walking through the house and resetting things because the 'restart' option on the phone is greyed out is severely annoying.\n\nThese guys are going back, and will likely be replaced with eero. The 'wired backhaul' option requires you to burn a dedicated vlan/switch for their own traffic. I had to do soo much routing/planning due to these things being so very useless.\n\nIt's Dumbed-Down to where it's just dumb.\n\npass on this, get something better."}

I'm not going to rehash what other's have written, but instead, just give a few key points that are fairly new and may not have been covered before.\n\n1) Family Hours - when I purchased Google WiFi, I thought I would be able to schedule times for on/off time without having to manually do it each and every time. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the only option I had was to manually turn off wifi for devices and then give it a start time to come back on. I gave feedback to Google and told them that it would be a lot better if it were possible for me to set a schedule for certain devices that didn't have to be manually done each time I needed to use it. A month later, i got an email stating that they liked my idea and implemented it. So now, at 10pm - 6am there are certain devices in my house that no longer have wifi, Sun - Thurs (School Nights). For me, as a parent, this awesome!\n\n2) Easy installation and coverage for a 2900 sq foot home was no problem for these devices. They can actually give coverage up to 4500 sq feet, I believe. So I have coverage in my front yard and back yard, too, because of where I placed each pod.\n\n3) That's it. I have no complaints and am very happy with my purchase. For more in depth reviews, check out some of the other comments. I mainly just wanted to sing the praises of the ability to schedule family hours etc. Other people have already covered everything else.\n\nUPDATE 8/24/2018: I now have 2 different friends who have purchased this for the same reasons I purchased mine. 1) The ability to have one login/password that works for all three hot spots and 2) Family hours, as described above. They are also parents of kids and they wanted to be able to limit the wifi time in a way that was easy. This WiFi system is very easy in that regard and I'm still very happy with it.\n\nOn a side note: we had some exchange students that came to live with us for a few weeks. I gave them the WiFi login and password as that was the only way they had connectivity to the outside world during their visit (their phones didn't work here the regular way). However, on a few occasions they were up quite late talking with each other and not sleeping like they were supposed to. So I took out my phone, opened the Google WiFi app and turned off the Wifi just for their devices until morning. Within 10 minutes they realized that they weren't getting back on the Wifi and gave up and went to sleep. Then I was able to get back to sleep, too. This little WiFi system from Google is AWESOME!"}

This setup allows you to do something that the only other competitor can do it is $200+ than Google Wifi. Very easy to setup and THE BEST mobile application by far is from Google.... all the other router manufacturers have many bugs with their apps (I tried dozens of routers in the past 2 years) and Google is a great software company. However, they lack stuff that it should be basic at this point.... hardwire communications are probably things you never think you should worry on a router in 2017, but with Google Wifi its a big issue. In theory it is a 1Gbps ethernet port, and I am lucky to have 1Gbps internet service from my ISP; Unfortunately, this device will drop significantly your quality of speed, in actual numbers any other router gives me 900+mbps speed test... whereas this one drops to 600mbps which is a 30% loss in throughput for your connection. In my case this is still super fast speed, but if you have 12Mbps means you took 30-40% of your speed by using google wifi to provide hard wire internet service to your device (smart tv, computer, etc). This setup allows the \"Satellite\" units to be linked wired or wireless (just set them up wireless initially and then unplug and do it wired). In summary, if all you do is wireless and you do not need fast ethernet connections, then this is an excellent device it really has a beautiful look and their software is such a great sale point. However, for my needs reducing the wired connections so much is reduce the quality of my \"satellite\" units that were also hardwired so I decided to send it back."}

I had been running a router on each floor to provide even coverage. This sort of setup worked but was a big hassle to maintain.\n\nThe Google system works fantastically well. The first puck acts as the router, and the remaining can connect wirelessly or be wired to the first puck. Setup is easy and quick. Network management is straightforward and is done using an app on the phone. You can create a guest network, do port forwarding, assign fixed IP addresses. You can't change the IP range to 192.168 if that's important. You can't use another company's router and have the Google mesh features: the first puck needs to be the router.\n\nOne point to make on setup is that you should disable the router and wifi you already have. If you have a combined modem/router/wifi setup from the cable company, all you want running is the modem. Let the Google wifi handle routing and wifi. Two router/wifi systems running at the same time can cause headaches, especially if the wifi networks have the same name.\n\nSome power users note this system lacks certain features. I'd say my setup is moderately complicated and the Google system works great. I use multiple switches, and wired backhaul, and all of my devices work great with excellent speeds.\n\nSwitches are a cheap and easy way to add wired connections if they're needed. You'll want an \"unmanaged\" switch. 8 port units are less than $30 here on Amazon.\n\nI've been running this setup for a few months now and it's been rock solid. No need to reboot, everything just keeps working. This product has definitely paid for itself in the time and headache it's saved me from keeping my old setup running.\n\n1 year update: the system continues to be very reliable. I've had zero problems with it. The guest network feature works well. My only complaint is that I'd like WiFi calling to work more reliably. Overall I still have no issues recommending the system."}

I've been using an Astaro/Sophos firewall for about 6 years with a Linksys E2500 in bridge mode and finally decided I was sick of modifying rules for new applications and troubleshooting connection problems. I wanted something that worked out of the box with no tinkering required and that's exactly what this is.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that you can't change the subnet it uses. It's 192.168.86.0 and you can't change it. It would be nice if you could at least select between a class A, B or C private network.\n\nAlso, the app moved through the setup a little more slowly than I would have expected - I got a little impatient at times, but it's a small price to pay to having all three pucks configured DHCP reservations created for printers and my Plex Media Server.\n\nA tip for those who are less savvy and haven't done in depth research:\n\nThese create a mesh network via WiFi to extend your signal. However, you can connect CAT5/6 to each puck and give it a Gigabit Ethernet link back to puck 1 (or a switch connected to puck 1) AFTER you finish setting up all the pucks. Just plug it in and it will detect you've given it a \"backhaul\" and switch from using a mesh network to your Ethernet uplink. Unless you have a lot devices that use WiFi heavily you probably won't notice the difference, but when it creates the WiFi mesh network, puck 2, 3, 4, etc. and all the devices connected to them end up sharing the WiFi bandwidth of puck 1. If you use hardwired Ethernet to link the pucks together, you avoid that, and then the hardwared Gigabit Ethernet link and your Internet connection are your bottlenecks."}

But there are times the initial device responsiveness to the web searches has a Latency delay sometimes up to 5 seconds. On Both Gig Wire and WIFI. This is unacceptable on a wired device connected though Gig switches. Speed tests are not consistent and then to be 20%+ slower on wired vs my AC1900. VOIP works great one day and struggles with upload voice the next day. This should not be happening with 320 mbs download and 30mbs upload speeds VOIP never fails on my AC1900 Netgear. And I noticed my ROKU streaming is running better with the switch back to my old router. Wired connection seem to suffer on the G.WIFI Coverage is very good on the WIFI, but it is overall no better coverage when it comes to speed and responsiveness. In the time, I had the Google WIFI there have been several push updates but it does not seem to be focused on these issues. I called their help desk multiple times and it is the typical responses: it might be my Internet, Hard reset the router and reinstall it, vs accepting they have and issue to work on\nAnyhow \u2026 It tried it . Like parts of it \u2026But it is not ready for my simple home use. As a Nest owner, I expected better. I will take a look if there is a Google WIFI 2 in their future. If there is \u2026FIX the Wired side too! I drop from 5 stars to 3\n\nOriginal\nFast delivery as a Prime user, showed up in one day.. I will leave all of the Pros and Cons issues to those more critical thinkers and have their points of issues. For me I was looking to improve coverage in a multiple story home all of the other routers seem to be WIFI weak on my outer limits. I had recently moved to a Netgear R6000 AC1200 routers. Great trade up if you are in the same room or several feet away from the room, Otherwise data bandwidth was marginal no different that n my older generation routers. I'm connected to Cable Internet using +100MBs Download and 20 MB upload on wired.\n\nI wrestled on buying the Google WIFI system for months and then on to how many Pods .. I opted for the 3 pod package simply due to it is cheaper per device as a set. I Setup all of the devices in the same room sitting at my desk at a start. Simple install on my Android phone, Google pushed out two firmware updates, and then I repositioned them where I thought they would best perform in the house.. Overall the coverage seems great and more than Likely I could get away with 2 Pod in a 2,800 sq Ft living area.\n\nWIFI Setup I used the same WIFI Name and Password and within minutes of rebooting the new system all of my devices connected and work through the Apps and programs without and issues. WEMO schedules seem to fail on two devices the first day . I restarted all of the Wemo devices and all was OK the next day\n\nI have 12+ GB wired PS, Servers and devices in the house, As state in other write-ups a Gig Switch is needed. Overall just as fast. No apparent slow down is large data transfers on wire. I use a Vonage VOIP with two lines that is heavily used for business.. No issues noted seem to have good data prioritizations.\n\nI have 30+ wireless critters demanding time, Wemo's , Light Hubs, Flux light bulbs,Net Thermostat, Nest Protects, 2 Google homes, 3 Echo devices, 2 Roku Hubs, Chomebox supporting streaming, Tablets, Phone's, overall performance seem to be equal and better, Coverage is solid and responsive vs delays before.\n\nThe WIFI App has a couple features if you into looking at it. It is simple to use and make adjustment on your phone faster than logging into a Router using an IP address. Most of the App is easily used . I tend not to need it after it is up and running..\n\nI'm only into it uses for a couple days now, Time will tell if it performs, but for now I give it a the 5 stars fro my style of use. I leave it to the fast thinkers to dive into the items I will not be concerned with."}

I love the app to manage and configure these devices and the statistics it provides about your network. This by far is one of the better solutions for creating a mesh network. The main issues I take with this product the limited ability to configure the nodes in terms of IP addressing, dhcp, dns, port forwarding, etc. If you want an easy solution of a product with the newer ac WIFI and also natively supports a mesh and dont care about subnets or the other settings I mentioned, then get this product.\n\nPros:\n-802.11ac (the newer WIFI with better range and bandwidth, need ac compliant devices to actually take advantage of these speeds though)\n-gigabit ports (hopefully standard in most routers by now xp)\n-Google App (can control a list of features from right from your phone, see bandwidth overall, see which devices are hogging the bandwidth right now, centrally configure you access points (APs), blacklist devices, dhcp reservation, port forwarding\n-wired connection nodes (for the love of god, get a switch and hard wire these nodes on the same lan if you have more then one, sure they can wireless connect back to the primary router, but why would you ever do that if you dont have too? That wireless connection between the access point and your primary router node is a bottleneck and will impair your performance)\ncons:\n-fixed subnet (as of now you cannot dictate or change the subnet, the google node decides for you which might be annoying if you are running a home lab or already have an existing subnet you dont want to change)\n-fixed dhcp (as of now you cannot control the DHCP scope which is kind of annoying if you have a home lab and want to be assured your statically assigned servers addresses are not in the dhcp pool, there is no option to change the scope or even disable it and use your own dhcp server, you cant even add a search domain or dns servers)\n-port forwarding (as of now you can only port forward to devices you created a dhcp reservation which is limiting to servers you might want statically assigned, you should have option to port forward to any ip address whether or not it is in the dhcp reservation)\n-dns options (if you want to use your own dns and want your router node to point to it, it cannot be on the same subnet, the google router will always attempt to look for it on its outside \"internet\" interface rather then locally, personally i'd rather have the option to put the address in the dhcp info but google routers does not let you do that either)\n-IP of node (you cannot dictate what the ip address is of any of the google nodes, the first one appears to always take the .1 in the last octet, but added nodes are DHCP, maybe this isnt a problem if you dont care about what IPs these nodes get, there is not option to change or statically assign them locally)\n-PoE (not really big con, but I'd like to see power over ethernet on these)"}

It also has aluminum siding, and part of the house was an add on installed in the 80s. This means that about 1/2 of my house is located directly behind a brick fireplace, and getting Wi-Fi outside is a great challenge since the metal siding interferes. To add to the problem, about 1/2 of the garage also has metal backed insulation.\nI had already installed some Ethernet lines to connect some wired gear, but that doesn't solve the Wi-Fi problem, and I've tried several power line products, range extenders, and I also own several WRT routers with ddwrt installed and working in bridge mode. The results with those products have been spotty at best.\n\nSince this will work wired, and wireless, I was able to connect the main unit on one side of my brick wall, one additional unit in my basement through my previously installed Ethernet cable, and the third unit is connecting wirelessly and sitting on a shelf near a widow facing my patio.\n\nI now have full Wi-Fi coverage inside my house (which I never had before), and it appears that the signal on my patio is now useful enough to take Wi-Fi calls-which is great. If it's not, I can always add another end point closer to my patio and it will make it great.\n\nI'm currently using this system with a PLEX server, 2 Rokus, a NAS, several Android devices, several wired and wireless security cameras, a couple of wired Windows 10 machines, a couple of Linux boxes, and Windows 10 and android tablets, along with several other random wireless devices.\n\nIt was a PITA to deal with the fact that this router uses 192.168.86 instead of 192.168.1 - which I am very used to. This means I had to redo a bunch of configuration. The good news here is that this does DHCP reservation, and port forwarding. I also had some scripts that will need to be rewritten because I can't DHCP those devices back to their original IP addresses. Oh well.\n\nI dislike the idea that I need an app to configure this system. The device already serves a web page if you point your browser at it, so it seems relatively easy to have added a web config tool.\n\nI'm also slightly worried that it seems to require internet access to function. If my modem were to fail, does that now mean my wireless network is also in danger of no longer giving me access to my local network? That remains to be seen."}

Before purchasing the product I called Google to make certain that it would work since I CANNOT turn my current providers router/modem into bridge mode (Verizon Fios) as this will disable MOCA and make a few of my cable boxes paperweights as they rely upon this connection method to get cable and VOD. I was assured that this would not be a problem, though they weren't very familiar with what \"MOCA\" was. This was disconcerting but I figured that at worst I would simply return the units.\n\nTo that end I went to a local retail location rather then Amazon to purchase this product as they were having a small sale. Setup was easy and my wireless connections worked far better and my few weak and dead zones were gone. However, oddly the second mesh unit that I had in a wired location in my Family Room was not showing as wired in and was instead working as a mesh unit. Odd, but I thought Google would obviously have a support document to say how to set this up properly. They did...but it was amongst the most vague and poorly worded tech documents I have ever seen, mostly with an intuitive flow chart to make it 'easier' then any real text. I gathered from the information there that I had to have the ethernet cable going from the secondary Google Wifi port on the primary Google Wifi device direct to the second Google Wifi device. Since they're on different floors they were originally going through two unmangaged switches on this journey. This did not work. Thinking that perhaps they meant directly into the Wan port of the device downstairs I switched from my Unmanaged Switch to that port directly from the wall both upstairs and downstairs and it did work and showed up as a wired connection. Sadly, it did not pass a connection from its second port back out to all the other devices plugged into the unmanaged port downstairs.\n\nThis is when I first called Google Tech Support. They were completely useless. Not only did they have no clue what bridge mode or MOCA was as my fear was that the Google Wifi was trying to provide its own IPs and was messing with my primary router. They did not understand why that was a cause for concern. Nor did they have any idea how to provide assistance. There main mode of support was 'turn/unplug everything and turn it on again.' When, I had of course done this before calling them. That old chestnut of tech support ignorance out of the way the level 1 tech connected me to a level 2 and finally level 3 tech all of which remained utterly clueless and none of which knew at all what bridge mode meant or if my main router was causing a problem like I suspected. Eventually I seemed to come across the solution myself and disconnected the port going into my living room from the primary Google Wifi point and then plugged it back into a unmangaged switch upstairs. Then from the end of that connection downstairs into the secondary Google Wifis WAN port and then from that ones secondary port into the unmanaged switch there. And suddenly everything seemed to work. Getting off the phone with the Google Support tech I tested the connection and everything seemed to be working well.\n\nUpon waking up the next morning however I noticed that the Living Room secondary unit was again acting as a mesh unit and was not seeing the wired connection and again all my devices connected to it were offline. Annoyed I just figured the wired connection was not to be and disconnected the secondary units Ethernet ports and went back to my previous connection type happy that at least I had an expensive though working quite well wifi booster. However, upon opening up my Plex server to watch some movies I noticed that it failed to connect. Fearing the worst I attempted to log into it with my NAS's web interface only for the IP to come up as resolvable. Going upstairs I checked the NAS and found that its IP had been somehow reassigned by the Google WIFI router even though it had never been directly connected to it at any point. Groaning I checked the rest of my devices. All of my port forwarding and permanently assigned local IP addresses had been broken by the Google Wifi. This was infuriating but not entirely unexpected.\n\nThrowing up my arms in defeat I went into my Fios modem and put it in bridge mode. I knew if I was going to make this work I'd just have to deal with the Google Wifi as my new main router. And I never watched much TV anyway, so I might as well embrace this as finally cutting that cord. So not a big loss. Sadly, the Google Wifi's port forwarding, MAC address filtering, and IP reservations were completely lacking and in fact worse then a cheap $25 router. So back to the store the Google Wifi units went after another totally unproductive call to Google support whose sole solution seemed to be 'turn it on and off again and wait an indeterminable amount of time for our diagnostics technicians to look over a report.'\n\nAll of that said I think this is a great product for someone who has absolutely no complexity in their WIFI setup, and doesn't have any sort of MOCA boxes with their own proprietary connections. If you do, or want more advanced control of your network this product is not for you."}

But I ended up returning it due to its limitations.\n\nWhat I liked: it's an unobtrusive and comes with an excellent app to manage the system. In addition, each node blasts a strong Wi-Fi signal. Finally, I suspect Google Wifi is more secure than the competition, given Google's security experience as well as including and utilizing a TPM module.\n\nHere's what I didn't like, and in the end caused me to return the product:\n1) The mesh capability doesn't work in 'bridge' mode. This ended up being a dealbreaker since my gigabit service requires the use of an ISP-provided gateway that doesn't allow pass-thru. This generally will not be an issue with cable (Spectrum, Optimum, Comcast) or with Verizon FiOS, but for those who require a bridged mode, this product won't work (as of the time of this review). As a point of comparison, both Linksys Velop and Netgear Orbi work in bridged mode.\n\n2) The mesh system doesn't have a dedicated wireless backhaul, unlike the Velop and Orbi. What this means is that the mesh points (other than the main node that's connected to your ISP) will have provide lower bandwidth to your devices compared to mesh systems with a dedicated wireless backhaul. This will not be an issue if a) you use Ethernet as backhaul for your nodes (i.e., each node is connected to each other via Cat5e/Cat 6), or b) if subscribe to lower ISP speeds.\n\nWhile these may not be issues faced by the majority of users, for those of us with very high internet speeds and deal with an ISP limitation there are better products."}

You are stuck with 192.168.86.x IP range. Why is this important? If you have an existing network that consists of multiple devices i.e. Sonos, IoT's, NAS, etc that use a specific IP range, you will need to reconfigure all these devices to use 192.168.86.x network. I am surprised how they missed this basic thing. Also, if you have multiple subnets and you want to reserve a specific RFC 1918 IP range to that network, you are stuck. The IP range is hardcoded into the device.\n\nOf course another issue is lack of ports. You HAVE to purchase a Switch if you have multiple devices on your home network. It comes with one LAN port. This, however, was not an issue for me since most devices I have are on wireless and purchasing additional switch for $30 is not a deal breaker.\n\nIf above two things are not a concern for you, I strongly recommend this Router if you want to extend the wireless range of your home network."}

I was able to connect the access points via an ethernet to the main access point. You just need to make sure they're downstream of the main access point. For me this meant ISP Router --> Main Google wifi access point --> GB switch --> Remote Access Points X 2.\n- When you connect the access points, they automatically detect the ethernet connection. The app will show that they're active and attached via a wired connections. There's no configuring necessary to make this happen.\n- Even without the ethernet connections, I was getting pretty good connectivity between the access points across floors.\n- You can do basic configuration like assigning a static IP to a specified device. I did this for my print server so that it could be found easily.\n- There's very little latency / delay when connecting via wifi\n- For those that aren't familiar, a mesh network means that the hardware seamless hands off your device to the strongest access point. Unlike if you use a router and range extenders where your device hangs onto its original signal until it can't detect it anymore before connecting to a stronger signal.

This is via a fiber, GB internet connection. When I speed test via a hardwired network, I'm getting 900+ MB/S. I still haven't been able to figure out what's causing the loss in connection speed.\n\nMy situation:\n- Small house spread vertically across 3 floors. We had a router in our 2nd floor office and a second wifi bridge on the 3rd floor before, but our devices were not automatically switching to the strongest signal. So, we had to manually reconnect when up on our 3rd floor. No longer an issue with the mesh network.\n- Since installing google wifi, our video streaming and connections are noticeably faster and seamless"}

Everything seems to be working fine and overall performance is dramatically higher. High marks for Google's service department. They are easy to contact and are very responsive. These aren't deal killers, but I'd like to have more Ethernet ports on each device and I'd like to be able to wall mount in some locations. I'm using it with a 10Mbit CenturyLink DSL modem. I see the full 10MBit at each end device. I haven't tried device to device communications, so I can't say how fast it works internally. I also don't know how well it works with cable or fiber.

It almost works. All internet functions work on all my devices, except one. In order to stream videos from my iMac to my iPads or iPhones, I use a function of the VLC video app called Universal Plug and Play. It worked fine with my Apple router as wall as my Verizon FIOS modem/router and a Linksys router. There was no reason to expect a problem with any other router. Well,UPnP does not work with Google Wifi, and if streaming is the reason you are considering this product, save your money. I have spent hours rewiring my system, resetting devices and emailing Google customer support. From April 16, 2017 to May 26 their support has provided no answer, keeps asking me the same questions, makes excuses and does nothing but raise my already-elevated blood pressure. Their responses are more like \"Keep him on the hook until he can't return the router or until he quits trying to fix the problem.\"\n\nIf video streaming is not your purpose for this product and you are willing to spend weeks of your time to get no usable answer from customer service for a problem, buy this. It is easy to set up, is fast, and greatly expands your home wifi service area. Other than UPnP, I would have given 5 stars, but that problem plus poor customer service made me want to give one star (kind of like leaving a waiter a dime tip to let him know you didn't forget). So 2 stars it gets. If Google calls me, says \"Do this...\" and UPnP works, I'll try to change to 5 stars."}

I have had WiFi issues throughout the better part of my house and in the office building in my back yard for years because the modem is in the front corner of our house.

I used Linksys/Cisco power-line adapters for the past few years and it was always dropping the signal and the speed was dial-up speed at best, most of the time.\n\nLooking for alternative options when my power line adapters finally went out completely, I ran across the WiFi mesh systems and started researching. I went with Google based on other reviews, their brand and reputation -- and I am glad I did!\n\nInstallation of the Google WiFi system was a BREEZE using the Google WiFi App on my iPhone. Setup took all of 15 or 20 minutes and I now get the FULL internet speed I pay AT&T for each month on ALL devices, in ALL areas of my house and in the office in my back yard.

Only regret is that I didn't purchase this when it first came out.\n\nWe have about 4300 sf over three floors, including a finished basement. Prior to Google Wifi, I had a Verizon Fios 802.11n router in the lower level, a Linksys 802.11n router on the main level and a network extender on the upper level...all in order to try to get coverage throughout. It did not work well as we had locations with poor coverage and our mobile devices (including laptops) were often connected to the \"wrong\" wifi with the weakest signal. Download speeds were often slow or we would lose connection altogether for a period of time.\n\nI turned off wireless on the Fios Router and removed the Linksys router and network extender from the equation. The main (hardwired) Google router is on the main level with one each centrally located on the floors above and below. Coverage is great everywhere and speeds are lightening fast (over 80Mgbs both download and upload).

{"Author": "J. I. Mcmillan", "Date": "on May 16, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Fantastic for the Average Consumer", "Text": "TL;DR It's a great mesh WiFi system, and would be great for most average consumers. If it's in your budget, and you feel you could take advantage of it, buy it. You won't regret it.\n\nI bought this product after reading about mesh WiFi systems a year or two ago. It seemed like an interesting concept to me, but it was still fairly new, and therefor, there weren't many options available to the average person. Fast-forward to a month or so ago, and I was desperately in need of a new router.\n\nMy old Linksys (10+ years old) kept blowing out A/C adapters. I have is flashed with a custom firmware, and had to increase it's power draw to boost the WiFi to reach most of our new apartment. This is a problem only because this building was built in the '50's, so the walls aren't exactly WiFi friendly. Even with that boost in power, though, the WiFi would cut in and out randomly, and certain spots (such as the bathroom and most of the master bedroom) could hardly receive a signal at all. After going through my third A/C adapter, I knew it was time to retire my trusty old Linksys in the search for something new.\n\nBeing intrigued by mesh WiFi, still, I did a quick search, only to find out Google had tossed their hat into the ring with the Google WiFi System. Color me intrigued. I did my research, and settled on the idea of buying it. I was going to wait, but I was at work dreading not having WiFi at home for the time being, looked on Amazon, and found it at MSRP with same-day shipping from the local Amazon warehouse. I was sold. Got home from work, grabbed my package, and off I went.\n\nSetup was pretty damn simple. Anyone who has set up a router before should have no problem doing so with ease. The setup did take a little longer than I expected, as you have to do a connection test for each mesh point as you set them up, but it really wasn't an issue for me. A extra thumbs up to Google for the very intuitive app, I might add. It gives you time estimates for things to complete, so you're not stuck just waiting for it to finish in an unknown amount of time.\n\nOnce it was set up completely, I did the speed test, and boy was I shocked. Where I live, we're shackled to Xfinity for internet at the speeds I want/can afford. My old router, being as old as it was, was only ever able to give us about half of my modem's speeds when WIRED. The speed test I ran with Google WiFi showed that I was getting my full allotted speeds over WiFi! I was in disbelief! Never have I had WiFi go over 100Mb/s! The wired connection to my mesh in the office for my PC was no different. Perfect connection with max speeds.\n\nIn the month or so since I bought Google WiFi, I've only had one hiccup where my office mesh point went down. I did a simple mesh point reboot in the app, and a minute later, my internet was back and working. Haven't had any issues since.\n\nThe biggest con I could possibly say about this system is one that will only affect those of us who are used to tinkering with our routers. There is no fancy stuff here. There's no DMZ, which was pretty upsetting for me, but I knew about that going into it. You can't really tweak very much with this system, and if that's what you're looking for, don't even bother. There's many other routers out there that you can tinker with besides this one.\n\nBut if you're just someone looking to get reliable WiFi around your home (and a couple wired connections as well!), and without all of the hassle of complicated setup, then this is for you. The price tag is a tad hefty, but this should keep you going for the foreseeable future, in my opinion. I highly recommend it."}

Even the packaging is beautiful, full marks on the design front.\n\nCons: However even though i'm in a mostly wooden Californian 3000 Sq ft house the nodes don't appear to work well if there is a wall or any obstacle in line of sight - my download speed at my PC when tested doubled over my Almond range extender - great - but only to 10mps and I have a AT&T's Gigapower set up - while the first Google node is pushing over 100 Mps one floor directly below that its down to under 30mps. By the time the third node is set up it's below 20mps. In the set up instructions it tells you that each node should be within 30 feet of the 'master' in an open area. I spent an hour moving these things around the downstairs of my house to get a good signal and then still only get 10mps, 25 feet and one room away. So if your home is not perfectly square and the wifi nodes are more than 30 feet away from the master I don't see what I'm gaining over a straight forward range extender I plug in to a wall socket ?\n\nSo do I now invest in more nodes to cover the house - having one in every room seems to defeat the objective - some hype in the marketing claims I think -\nso for the money I'm not that impressed."}

Apple routers, Asus top routers and more recently I purchased a 6 unit open mesh system which didn't cut it. With open mesh it would drop whatever I was doing when bouncing between devices. My house is 3500sqft with a back yard and front yard that gets used by my work from home wife and daughter. I decided to scrap everything and start over with 6 google wifi hubs. Two of them are hard wired and on opposite ends of the mesh and I spread the other 4 Around as evenly as possible. For my hallway I found a clean looking wall mount that cradles the hub and ran wires through the wall into a closet that has power so it's all hidden.\nAfter an extremely easy 30 min. Setup I had all of them up and running using just the app from the Apple App Store. As other reviewers have said it took about an hour and a half before I was getting full strength signal and speed from anywhere in my home front to back and outside. I turned off the lights on the hub from within the app and also did a network restart in order to force a firmware upgrade on the units.\nHappy to say after living in my new house for 3 years now I nolonger need to deal with why the wifi isn't working.\nWhen I speed test I get my full bandwidth 72mbs and 10mbs up no matter where I am or what hub I've connected to.\n\nMisc: the on.here site that's provided by google for controlling home devices works great. I have philips hue in my daughters room and belkin WeMo light switches through out the house. Mainly I control the lights via voice with Alexa but it's nice to set the color on the fly in my daughters room right from safari. It's very responsive.\nAlso now that my network has such great coverage my nest cams throughout the house work much better and no more offline emails. I also have some IP cams and it was very easy in the google wifi app to reserve their IPs so they wouldn't be changed.\nI haven't found any benefit yet by setting priority.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is I prewired my house with cat6 and have drops located in multiple places. I had planned on using access points that support POe so I didn't concern my self with making sure there was an outlet near by. Would be nice if these devices supported POe but they work so well with just an ac wire there really isn't much point in my case."}

It's targeted at home users but could possibly serve a small business in a similar fashion. Some will argue that the UI is too limited and they can't do everything they want to do. I argue that much of what the tinkerers want is the ability to brag about how they designed and administered their home network, when it just doesn't matter - everybody does it, most through a handy UI, and it's not nearly enough to brag about. Sure, you're limited to the subnet they choose, but who cares? Just do DHCP reservations for the things that matter, and move on.\n\nFact is it just plain works, and works well. I deployed the first unit in our laundry room, because that's where the cable modem came in. I put the second unit in my office since it's not wired for LAN and was infeasible to get wired affordably. The third unit went in the living room, where it has a view of the patio and can give us three bars of Wifi instead of zero. Setup was simple, logical, and intuitive. The app is awesome, and it's great to be able to see postings on Facebook by neighbors and friends asking if our home internet was up, and being able to just pull up the app from anywhere to check."}

In my apt (no heavy walls, all one floor) my connection speed dropped to almost zero about 30 feet from the primary unit. So why 5 stars? Well with all 3 units carefully positioned I am getting the same speeds as delivered by my cable company via ethernet in almost the entire apt, about 70GB/sec.\n\nThe app is great, tech support answered immediately even on a Sunday, and as i said, coverage and speed is fantastic. And now there is nothing left to do except use the internet.....:-)\n\nNote: its security is WPA2 so older devices running pre-wpa2 security won't work, but most people probably are immune.

Their ability to mesh network and always find optimal channels results in the fastest WiFi I've ever seen in my fairly large and old house (4,000 sq ft, built in 1926).\n\nIn the past two years, I've been through several sets of wireless routers. First there was the Arris modem & router that I bought to use with my home system. If I was lucky, I'd get ~ 26mb/s if I was close to it, and less than 8mb/s if I was upstairs in my bedroom. Then, after reading reviews, I bought the Asus AC1900. This was supposed to save all my problems. I saw no improvement over the Arris modem, and the speeds were the same. Oh...turns out I needed to try and exploit my 5GHz channel to try and get higher than 30mb/s. Then the Asus AC1900 burnt out, and it was useless. Next I tried the Netgear Nighthawk, and while I occasionally saw speeds up to 41mb/s, it wasn't delivering ANY strength to the upstairs of my house. At this time, I was switching between home internet service with a peak of either 30mb/s or 45mb/s.\n\nCue the Google hardware. I immediately started getting 48mb/s all through my ground floor, and about 41mb/s upstairs (using a total of 5 devices). I switched to 75mb/s home wifi last week, and now I'm getting 88mb/s close to my hub, and 81mb/s throughout the rest of the house. This system is great!\n\nAdditionally, there are many great controls within the Google app that help me manage device usage and scheduling - an important consideration with my kids (ages 12 and 15). I can put them on a diet as to how much time they get online each day, and it's dead simple to set up guest networks and control access on a device-by-device basis. The Google app has really intuitive scheduling services, and it also allows me to share network access with guests via texts, email, etc. The scheduling and access functions can, in many ways, take the place of paid services or extra devices such as Disney's Circle.\n\nI'm incredibly impressed by this system. It's about time someone made home networking gear that anyone can use, and where you don't need to be a networking engineer to configure and run the system!"}

Sometimes I'm without wifi for a few seconds when I leave the range of my primary point. But i can manuallh reconnect with no issue.\nTwo times in the month I've owned it, I've had to hard reset the network due apparently to a known bug that's being worked on. Those were the only times I had any issue.\nComing from a router that had to be fiddled with every other day I'm very pleased with this system."}

The problem is always the same. My modem is in the basement of my two story home with no easy way to place the router on the first floor. So with most wireless routers there is very little signal on the first floor and even less upstairs in the bedrooms.\n\nSo I decide to try Google Wifi with the promise to my wife that I would return it if it wasn't any better. I had a D-Link AC3200 router with a range extender on the main floor which caused our speeds to be less than half of a direct connection to the router that wasn't possible from the basement.\n\nWe would get frequent drops and poor performance with our previous set-up. I set up Google Wifi with one device on each level of my home, main in the basement, one on the main floor, and one in the master bedroom.\n\nThe set-up was very easy and the app explains what to do step by step. The app works very well on my iPhone. All the wifi points linked up easily and the tests were successful. Our speeds and coverage doubled. I have yet to get a single disconnect on any of my connected devices.\n\nWe run two outdoor Nest cameras and one baby monitor off of Google Wifi and everything is very fast and reliable. Prior to installing Google Wifi the baby monitor camera (the farthest connected device from the cable modem) would have a signal strength of about 40% and was choppy and slow to watch and frequently offline. With Google Wifi the camera signal is always at 100% and is smooth and all functions can be used.\n\nWe have been so impressed by Google Wifi we gave away our 250.00 D-Link one to a family member. The ONLY downside is that there are only two ports on the back of the wifi unit. We have two wired connections in the basement so we had to purchase a Gigabit switch to go with the wifi unit so we could plug in both computers.\n\nWe love Google Wifi and it has fixed all of our wifi dead spot and speed issues."}

I started out on Google's Wifi site where they have a tool that can help you figure out how many you should need for full coverage in your home. I have a 2-story home with a little over 2,000 sqft, 3 units were suggested and the set of 3 was the best deal ($130 each or $300 for a set of 3).\n\nThe setup was amazingly simple. Downloaded the app on my phone and it walked me through the rest, from scanning the QR code on the first unit to adding the additional ones, even making suggestions as to where to place them. The features are really nice such as tagging devices (I tagged my kids tablets together) and the ability to pause all devices in one tag. Current device usage and prioritization, Wifi health checks and Internet speed tests on the app are simple to use and seem to give correct information.\n\nThe performance has been excellent as well. I was replacing a 4+ year old Apple AirPort Time Capsule and it's nice to get the latest AC and Mesh features at a very affordable price compared to similar technology from other manufacturers.

Seemed like a great set up, and saw great reviews. And other than one big issue, it has done really well.\n\nFirst the positives. While it took a little longer than I hoped, the set up was pretty straight-forward and the performance of the WIFI is fantastic. We now have good coverage throughout the house and everywhere I've checked the performance is much better than what I had with my old Netgear router.\n\nNow the issue. My son and I both play League of Legends. Consistently, at least once or twice a game, the connection drops. My son's computer is hard-wired in via a 8-port switch off the main Google puck, and I'm using WIFI. We are both playing, in separate games, and we both drop at the same time. The same thing happens even when only one of us is playing. This never happened until we switched to the Google WIFI, and given one of us is on WIFI and the other hard-wired, this almost has to be a router issue.\n\nAfter contacting the Goggle help desk, they suggested I set up port forwarding. Two problems with that: 1) I can only forward for one of the two computers, 2) while it has made things better, there are still a lot of drops.\n\nNow is the is the biggest issue in the world? No. Does it feel like that to my son who loses his game due to the drops. Yes. I'm currently looking for alternative solutions now.\n\nUpdate: By putting my old router and a switch between the modem and the Google Wifi, I was able to still connect up my son's computer direct, and I'm using the Google Wifi. Now it seems to be working. Issue seems to be with the Google Wifi working as a router instead of just Wifi."}

I now have whole house coverage with 3 attractive little devices. Whereas before with 2 wireless routers I was unable to have full coverage.\n\nThe first thing you notice about these (I have the 3 pack) is how well made and durable they appear. They don't have that cheap disposable feel. The packaging is superb and the included cables are seemingly high quality. I believe Apple started the trend of high end packaging and bringing an element of luxury to electronics. Maybe it's wasteful, but it does add to the user unboxing experience.\n\nI spread my 3 devices out to include my backyard, so I have 2 on the first floor of my 3 floor home and 1 on the second floor. In the basement I keep the wireless router that is supplied by my ISP. It only handles one device wirelessly now, which is the house printer. Everything else that is wireless is now on the Google mesh system.\n\nWith all the devices spaced out to where I think it will cover everything, I begin the setup process. One device has to be hardwired with an Ethernet cable directly from your router. Done. All need to be powered up. Done. Install the Google Wi-Fi app on your phone and follow the VERY easy to use instructions that will walk you through the process step by step. It literraly takes a handful of minutes to get your house blanketed by high speed internet.\n\nA feature I especially like is the guest Wi-Fi. I can set an easy to remember password and toggle this feature on whenever I throw a party or have guests at the house. Toggle it off when it's not needed. I can also can check the status of the mesh remotely. Can reboot or update each one individually. Run diagnostics and speed tests. It's pretty great. Best part is there hasn't been a single hiccup since I installed it. Not one minute of downtime.\n\nI highly recommend this product if you have a home where Wi-Fi isn't getting to all areas."}

I narrowed my search to a new router, looking at either Google Wifi or the Synology RT 2600 Router, based primarily on the topology of our house (a mesh solution seemed safer than a single router solution) and customer/CNET ratings garnished for both products. Our 4B/2.5B house is 1800 Sq feet spread out over 3 stories-- I needed great access on the top floor where we have the Samsung 8500 TV, Apple TV, and Blue Ray player as well as an iMac and iPad Pro and 2 bedrooms. The Harmony hub controlled lights and locks and Amazon Echo on the 2nd and 3rd floor can function at a much slower access speed. My expectations on speed, aesthetics, and setup have been met. I bought a 5 port gigabyte LAN switch from a TP-link to expand the single LAN port on the Google Wifi unit and accommodate direct connections to the Samsung 8500 TV, Samsung Blue Ray player, and Apple TV, avoiding the issue of canabilizing the wifi signal. The result is that there is a 225 Mbyte signal in the master bedroom, and 50-80 Mbyte signal in the other areas of the house with a single router. The only glitch was the Skybell doorbell failed to work. Evidently Skybell does not play on Google Wifi, owing to its WPA security standard and its inability to play on a 5 Ghz network. I got things working, however, by recycling the old Apple Router and plugging it into a second Comcast Ethernet port. In the future, there is the option to add a 2nd Google Wifi router (or even a 2nd generation Google Home) if speed is a requirement or there is the need for additional ports downstairs to directly connect other devices. I configured a primary network and guest network in under 5 minutes. It does everything our household needs without much fuss or relative cost."}

I set up the three devices in a roughly triangular configuration, spread around my house to cover areas where I have previously had poor reception. It was very easy to set up and performs well. One star off for the severe limitations on how you can control it - there appears to still be no web access, there is no way to give it an address range to use (which causes me problems), and there appears to be no way to set up a gateway to another subnet.\n\nI have a couple of fairly old devices that have hard-wired addresses due to their vintage and usage, and I can find no way to set up a bridge from the Google address range to the addresses or subnet I used to use. It's still a net gain but I'm going to end up having to set up a linux box with two NICs and ipchains or some such just so restore my network to it's previous service level. I fear I'll end up spending enough time and energy on this that I would have been further ahead to buy one of the more expensive but much less friendly alternatives due to this...\n\nIn summary, highly recommended if you want an out of the box solution to address dead spots in your house or yard. Not quite as highly recommended if you are an advanced user and have requirements that go beyond the basics. If everything on your existing network uses DHCP, you'll be fine. Oh, and you have to have a phone that can run the google app, and to be logged in to a google account to set up and use the system - so if you are at all concerned about privacy you may want to knock off a star or two mentally. I didn't do it because I don't think that users with needs such as mine are in their target audience, and they hit their target audience quite well."}

Very good for hard to cover areas, and great app for management.", "Text": "We have an old, very long house, that has been renovated many times. Many of our interior walls used to be exterior walls, etc. I'm kind of techy and have struggled for years finding a router that covers our whole house. Our square footage isn't large at all, but the arrangement just defeats any solution I have devised. I've used super powerful routers, and extenders and changed placement. You name it, I did it.\n\nWhen mesh routers hit the consumer market I was pretty excited, but still skeptical, since they connect to each other wirelessly. I figured they'd have trouble connecting and so my signal would still be weak, but improved. I read all the reviews and bit the bullet.\n\nI'm so glad I did. Installation was super easy - just follow the directions. It worked instantly, and well. The app is great. For example, I've identified all my son's devices, and have them in a group, so I can turn them all off in an instant without affecting the rest of my network. The diagnostics work very well. It really has solved so many of my issues with traditional routers and extenders. And so simple.\n\nPROS:\n\n* Very, very easy to install.\n* Good app, that makes it easy to manage, instead of the traditional method of logging into the router interface and deciphering tech-speak.\n* App lets me see who is on network, how much each device is using of my data, turn devices on and off immediately, and, my favorite, group devices and turn the group on and off.\n* It really does what it says - it covers my whole house with a great signal. Very stable.\n* Design is nice and doesn't look ugly in my house.\n\nCONS:\n* I hate the placement of the power cord. It's tricky to attach and detach. Hard to explain but very awkward. (I'd recommend changing, or adding a power button.)\n* When it fails - and that isn't often - I can't tell why, and its annoying to reset. I'm not sure I'm doing it right, but I've had to go through and unplug all the devices (see Con # 1 above), and then plug each back in again. The app doesn't help, because it isn't connected if the routers are having issues.\n\nI highly recommend if you struggle with coverage in your house. Even if you don't, the app makes the device well worth it if you like to control usage on your network."}

In a large house, where you need the points to connect in a multi-hop configuration, it is very difficult to get them to connect this way. Instead, as you add points which are farther away from the Primary point (but close to an already added secondary point), they seem to look for the Primary and not find it. These farther points then fail to connect to the mesh and ask you to move them closer to the Primary in order to connect. I thought that the whole idea of the product was to allow points to be farther away form the Primary via multi-hopping through secondary points, so why would I want to move one of these farther points closer to the Primary? That forces me to configure all points within one wifi zone of the Primary which works in small to medium sized homes, but not in large homes. There is some indication that if you first try adding a farther point by placing it right next to the secondary point that would be its closet neighbor, it will allow you to add it into the mesh, and then you can move it farther way. Not sure this really works, however, since the test results always report poor or weak mesh connections even though no two points are separated by more than one wall and 20 feet. The system seems to want to create a star configured network with the Primary at the center. \"Mesh\" is a misnomer here."}

This system is based on a new technology where all the Google WiFi pucks work together to create a mesh of Wi-Fi coverage throughout your house. Need more coverage? Just add more pucks. Setup is very simple like it should be in 2017 and after setting it up, the first thing we noticed was we could have Netflix and YouTube playing on the TVs in the bedroom and living room simultaneously while also taking a Skype call without any problems. Amazing!!\n\nThe app also sets a gold standard in ease of use. I just wish they had a web interface too.\n\nA cool feature I liked is the ease of setting up a Guest network. Now I have a Synology private data storage box in my house connected to our Wi-Fi network where everyone in our family stores all our photos and videos, financial documents and such. I have a printer and scanner connected to Wi-Fi. I also have various sensors and smart gadgets connected such as our water leak sensor for the water heater in the basement, our Nest thermostat, our Google Homes and some TP-Link smart plugs which we use for voice-activated lights and to ask the Home to kick off the morning coffee from bed. Obviously, I don't want to grant every guest access to my entire Wi-Fi kingdom, so I set up a Guest network with a different network name and password for them to join. It gives them access to the internet when they're here along with our printer-scanner but nothing else. Very easy to set up with the Google Wi-Fi app.\n\nI wish they would add some smart hub features so I can also connect my low-power battery-based ZigBee devices to it that I use to keep track of my windows being closed. Also some way of using the information about when phones join and leave the network so I can add some smarts to the house based on people coming and going. But as for Wi-Fi coverage, I'm one satisfied customer. And I highly recommend this system, particularly if you have a large area to be covered."}

I have A LOT of wifi devices - from 13 Sonos devices, 2 Ring Doorbells, 5 Roku devices, 1 Apple TV, 5 Wemo devices, 2 Lennox thermostats, and not even counting the smart phones, tablets, laptops, etc. In fact, I didn't realize how many I had until they started not to work shortly after installing the mesh.\n\nI reinstalled the entire Sonos system more than once in a two week period. Could never reconnect my Lennox thermostats. Wemo suddenly was dropping randomly. Roku reception was crappy. I didn't have any of these issues with my two Apple Airport Extremes and three wireless range extenders which I thought were being stretched to their limits. Again, never an issue with the Apple set up.\n\nI tried to make things work and was at the point of calling the AV people who installed our home theater and Sonos system. That's when I realized this would not be as simple as advertised. And what is the point of advertising something as simple if you need to pay a real tech person to make it work? Why should I pay over $600 and have to understand more about IP addresses than I have time for?\n\nI returned the whole system a few weeks ago and wound up getting 3 Apple Airport Expresses to extend my two wired Aiport Extremes and have been happy as a clam ever since.

Hopeful for a lot of future software/firmware development", "Text": "Great wifi mesh system, as long as you know what to expect.\n\nThe 2 biggest glaring issues for me are:\n1) inability to change IP range for LAN (inside the network). It defaults to 192.168.86.xx, which means screwing around for hours trying to change static IP addresses). If you don't have those, then you're in luck.\n2) Lack of DDNS. If you don't know what that is, you likely won't have a problem. If you have a surveillance system, better set up your device to report directly any changes in your WAN IP addresses (i.e., your provider changed the address). I use Dyn, so I downloaded their updater tool which is running on a computer that's always on. Still, it's a pretty basic requirement these days, and I can't believe they did not include it.\n\nI do like the ease of setup. The wifi mesh backload for me is garbage, luckily all 3 units are hard wired with gigabit Ethernet. The latest software update allows you to finally see they're wired vs. wireless. I do wish they could take away the crappy rating of wifi points between units if you're using a wire.\n\nThe rest are nitpicks. No sorting of devices based on name (just usage). If you have 40-50 devices, which I do, it's like finding a needle in a haystack. No automatic recognition of vendor based on MAC address (which leads to countless hours turning devices upside down to figure their MAC address so you can name them on the network).\n\nFor positives, and the reason why one would even get a mesh system, is coverage. The units deliver great speed and connectivity in all parts of the house now, with a somewhat seamless transition between points. You will drop connection as it switches access points for a second, so if you're doing something which requires a connection during that time, it'll time out (pressing submit on a purchase as it's handing you from one AP to the next, playing online game times out/kicks you offline, etc)."}

I bought this one for my dorm as the provided wireless network could only push out 40Mbps on a good day and other times would just flat out refuse to work so I decided to purchase this and use the provided wired Ethernet connection to use as the uplink.\n\nIncluded is a speedtest screenshot and a picture of the device sitting on the desk. The brightness is turned all the way up and very pretty to look at. Even after 24 hours of operation it only is slightly warm on the bottom half of the device but not burning hot. Data transfers from devices connected to the device was incredible with an unprecedented 38MB/s (304 Mbps) from a wireless client to a device attached to the LAN gigabit port on the device.\n\nFor everything this device has done right it isn't however without some flaws. The first thing I noticed was there was no way for you to set your own local LAN IP address subnet and it's locked at 192.168.86.x which granted for a small home network or even for someone who isn't into digging into the nitty gritty with their network it isn't that big of an issue but for me I'm hoping we get the feature in the coming updates. The second issue is the lack of a web interface for which to manage the device from. I understand that in this day and age if you don't have some sort of smartphone device you're most likely living under a rock but having the ability to do so really helps in decreasing the heavy dependence on such devices. I didn't remove a star because even though those features are missing it hasn't affected my utilization and use of the device.\n\nThe fact that the devices are protected with TPS and will only run Google-signed software its at least a peace of mind that nobody is going to hijack your devices in the middle of the night and is the first devices I have used to actually have that feature. The dual broadcast SSID on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands is a blessing since you don't have to worry about which wireless network you're connected to at a given time and it will automatically switch to whichever one your device supports and is in optimal range to utilize.\n\nUltimately though until they allow you to specify your LAN network I would not recommend this where you need more than a /24 (253 usable addresses) on your wireless network. For everything else, absolutely."}

{"Author": "Justin Lelacheur", "Date": "on April 4, 2017", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Why I decided on Google Wifi", "Text": "I'm sure like many of you, trying to decide among all the mesh router systems that have come out was not easy. I thought I would share my research for those that might appreciate a summary and why I ended up selecting Google Wifi.\n\nInternals:\nEero, G Wifi, Linksys Velop, Luma and Netgear Orbi all use Qualcomm chipset internals. Knowing from business experience how Qualcomm tightly controls reference design and software drivers it makes them very similar. They all deliver the same AC1200 2X2 MIMO speeds to user devices. Linksys and the original Netgear differ from the rest in that they have dedicated wireless backhaul radios with Netgear having double (1733 Mbps vs 866 Mbps) that of Linksys. This is why they have different AC2200 and AC3000 ratings, but that is all about backhaul speeds between the access points which I expect for most buyers is the critical decision point.\n\nBackhaul:\nI selected G Wifi for a few important reasons. As the whole pack of vendors are essentially the same in the most important aspect for speeds to user devices, where they differed most critically is in the dedicated radio for wireless backhaul and supported features. In my case, having Structured Ethernet throughout the house let's me use Ethernet backhaul which makes wireless backhaul unnecessary and saved me from the price premium for the Linksys or Netgear solutions. So eliminating that decision factor really opened it up and left me looking at eero, G Wifi and Luma given the better price points.\n\nSoftware:\nFrom a history standpoint, eero and Luma are startups and led this category of equipment, coming out in the first half of 2016. It shows as they have network and family software features that have not yet been enabled in solutions like G Wifi which came out more recently in the fall. These differences in features is all in the software with each adding new features with each new software update. These are very subjective in need and use for each so I won't cover them given the subjectivity.\n\nHome automation:\nHaving eliminated backhaul as the #1 decision factor I choose to focus on #2 which is future capabilities. Knowing that future software updates will close wi-fi feature gaps between them I was able to slim down the field around home automation which currently is barely acknowledged. Only G Wifi and Linksys have added a Zigbee wireless radio inside to let your wifi system also serve as the future home automation hub for connected devices. This is a natural fit in my opinion and G Wifi already supports Philips Hue Bulbs which saves me in the future from added yet another device specific for this in the future.\n\nGoogle doesn't really trumpet this capability in its marketing messages which I suspect is due to so few devices supported currently. Either way, knowing Google spent billions buying nest which I am also already invested in makes this converging home automation platform from Google an easy pick for me and will be a huge differentiator as they build it out. Knowing they own nest which leads the home automation category makes me believe they are making a huge investment here.\n\nUnboxing and setup:\nHaving bought Apple, Amazon and Nest devices, we've all become expectant of a meticulous unboxing and this is the best I've seen yet. It had a single simple card inside that essentially just says go here and download app. Otherwise, the three pucks each have power cables in identical boxes under each unit. Now, I have no experience in setting up other systems, but the G Wifi setup was amazingly simple and had me up and running quickly. I had some issues with the 2nd and 3rd syncing with the main unit, but the G wifi app has the tech support phone number built right into the mobile app I downloaded which had me connected to a support tech I kid you not within 2 minutes. We had to a reset those units, but they then came up no issues.\n\nSpeeds have been very good, but a vast change for anyone using an older 802.11n wifi router like I was. As speeds are very much subjective to the local environment of every home I'm leaving any kind of room by room detail out. Hope my research and commentary helps."}

Even my desktop that was directly connected by Ethernet is offline.\n\n5 or 10 minutes later without any intervention at all they return to normal. No, it's not the modem or my cable provider. I had a Nighthawk X8 router. It didn't quite cover the entire house but it never once locked up. This is all due to the Google WiFi.\n\nTech support? Very friendly but not too helpful. Just unplug them and plug them back in. Sure enough that cuts the dead time down from 5 minutes to 1 minute. But a few hours later... dead again. It could be I just got a dud. Or possibly by the time yours arrive whatever software bug these things have will be fixed.

Was very unhappy with it. The mesh technology was suggested to me by a friend. The Google version was the least expensive option of the three brands that seem the most reviewed. So returned the Asus and bought this.\n\nPros:\nVery easy to set up.\nOffers some simple parental controls. (pause kids devices)\nUses a phone app to control.\nProvides nice seamless coverage throughout the house.\nSpeeds are very good and consistent (in areas I have designated as important - see related con below.)\n\nCons:\n-Offers limited advanced options, so may not be for network techie people that really want to tweak and control all settings. Wasn't a factor for me.\n\n-Can ONLY be controlled from the phone app. (I would like to be able access from my laptop if needed.) Had it lock out my phone when I played with pausing kids devices, even though my phone wasn't on the list to be locked out. Since I had not set up another phone or device to be the administrator, I had to reset the entire system. Still haven't figured out exactly what went wrong. Possibly user error, but I don't think so.\n\n-Signal strength is not as strong as they advertise as far as coverage per unit. I have 3 units and need all three to cover my downstairs (2800sf 2 story house) due to walls, I guess (they suggest no more than two rooms separation between units - ie 2 walls it seems.) If there were any heavy users upstairs I would need at least one more to provide really good coverage upstairs. It does have a signal upstairs, it just is not as strong as I would like. But for my current usage patterns, this isn't a huge problem right now. Would advise keeping it in mind and planning ahead when you buy, depending on your setup.\n\n-only one lan connection on each unit. Not a huge deal, but did require the purchase of a simple inexpensive switch unit for the main office placement to run some hard connected devices.\n\nDespite being more verbose on the cons, I am happy with this router system and would recommend it."}

I installed one of the Google Wifi routers and the bedroom speed was still terrible but after installing all 3 (yes, instead of a 4500 sq ft home I needed 3 in an 1100 sq ft apartment), we now get speeds of around 40 Mbps, sometimes better, in the bedroom. So I am *very* satisfied and pleased that this works as I needed it to.

I was constantly power cycling everything to get back online.\nGoogle Wifi has really helped us simplify and keep a steady connection. It was super easy to set up, we just needed to turn off the modem's built in router and got rid of that extender. Our wifi connection is at least 50% faster - it was so slow before that our TV would never connect to let us stream anything.

We were barely able to get them 1 room apart without the Google WiFi app complaining that the connection was not adequate. If you have a very big house, or lots of walls, you will be buying additional access points, as 3 won't do the job. Google really needs to address this. I think they are trying to make the devices inconspicuous so that they blend in to any decor, but adding at least 1 external antenna to each device wouldn't compromise the looks that much and would allow more separation between the units.\n\nThe other negative is that there is only 1 ethernet port available once you have plugged your Internet modem into the 1st access point.

I've had a variety of wifi routers over the past 10 years and--for the most part--they have been set up and forget. When the network went down, it was usually Comcast's fault, and when it wasn't the unplugging/replugging sequence seemed to work fine. When my skydog service (cloud-based router) was discontinued, I decided to get a mesh router, as the coverage across my house hasn't been uniformly good.\n\nTo its credit, Google WiFi is easy to set up and provides pretty good coverage and throughput across the 3 stories of my house. I have no idea if it is the fastest solution--but, all the devices seems to work well. And, it nicely tests my internet speed every night--so, I know what Comcast is providing on a regular basis.\n\nThe problem is that the network has gone down 4 times in the 2 months that I've owned it. The first time in Feb, Google actually had a glitch on their end--where they reset the routers of either selected (or all) customers. (note--Google has access to your router and regularly updates the software/fimrware). I spent 4 hours one evening trying to diagnose the network problem (Comcast actually provided GREAT customer service, here), before I came to the conclusion that it was the Google devices that were the problem and plugged in an old router. It was not until THE NEXT DAY that I received an email from Google telling me about the problem and providing *incomplete* instructions on how to fix it. Another 3 hrs down the drain.\n\nRecently, the network went down again--3 times in 24 hrs--all due to problems with the Google devices. I wasted another 2 or 3 hours resetting the devices powering the network up and down before I got stability back. The problem is that I don't know for how long. To their credit, Google's service personnel has been patient and helpful. But, I'd like my wasted hours back and I now have to worry about what I'm going to do if the network goes down while I'm not at home and my wife (who runs a home business) has a deadline.\n\nOne of my general rules--which I violated here--is to avoid buying the first generation of a product line. It, typically, takes a while to work out all the bugs associated with different topologies and configurations. From my experience, Google hasn't got it all together with this technology. It's taken a piece of equipment which is normally out-of-sight and mind, and has given me yet another thing to worry about."}

Its a mesh network that firstly uses wireless communication to establish connection back to the base. You can't use the 2nd unit to connect to the main unit. They all have to be in range of the main unit. Which doesn't make much sense. Its also very quick to double NAT you.

BUT the wifi system would drop out periodically (average about once every week or two) requiring unplugging the units from the wall to re-set. Not acceptable with a home security system running over wifi. The two packs of 2 cost about half of the Google wifi 3-set.\nSo, I decided to try the Google wifi. Although pricey, it looked like it might solve my problem.\nI installed the first unit in the computer office upstairs; (SE corner of 2nd floor); the second in the bedroom across the hall on west side of second floor, but a bit north of the house corner. The third unit on the first floor near the middle of the house.\n\nIt took about 15 minutes to install the system including determining most effective locations.

They even had me connect to the primary hub over an ethernet cable. Sent them a diagnotic file on Friday and here we are on the following wednesday and its still not working. Some of my security cameras are now out. How many things to try and how long to i need to be down before the simply replace the defective ap?\nUpdate: After 6 days of troubleshooting they are going to send a replacement. Never did hear if the diagnotic files I sent them were any help. For some reason now my HP wireless printer no longer works over wifi. The printer says its connected and so does the google app but no IP address ever gets assigned. The printer works fine if I plug in ethernet to the google ap so its definately a wifi issue.\nUpdate 2: 2 weeks later I received a replacement hub but you guessed, it, it does the exact same thing. On the phone with support trying everything again. Emailed them another set of diagnostic files and they said expect an email back in 48-72 hours. I'm now going 2 weeks without a working hub. While I had the support person on the phone again I told them about my wireless printing problems. However this time when I hooked it up wireless, it got an IP address. I can only imagine they did a software update then fixed what had been broken earlier. Starting to think the problem is the primary hub now. Just learned there is no way to back up the configuration. I have loads of port forwarding rules and reserved IP addresses, and there is no way to backup the config.\nUpdate 3: Have used now for about 1-year. Remaining problems include random dropped connections even on wired devices, no way to set channel for 2.4ghz band and no ability to steer traffic to one particular AP which means your devices may choose to connect to an AP with poor signal rather than one closest by."}

It is bad when my daughter doesn't ...", "Text": "I purchased this because at the time I thought my current router had failed. I can't state how important it is for us to have a working router. We have cut the cord and our house is a true definition of a smart home. It is bad when my daughter doesn't know how to turn off her lap manually lol, as my wife pointed it out to me. My ideal smart home is for everything to work seamlessly, it should feel like a it's not there. Until it is not there and you realize how much you depend on the smart home. So getting a replacement was on top of my list, but never gave up on my old router. When researching for a new router I was looking at a mesh system because of the problems I was having with my current system. My house is around 1800 square feet, I feel it is not a extremely large house. But coverage of my Nighthawk Ac1900 was good but not great. In the house the signal was great we had no problems with a 60mbps on average. But we don't just live in the house, we like to be outside when possible. We have a tv in the patio with a fire tv connected to it. I found it easier to have a better wifi signal than run a bunch of wires outside. The problem was that my router didn't provide a great signal outside. So the connection was not consistent. To fix this problem I purchased a wifi range extender not just any one but a good one or so I thought. Well I shouldn't say it was bad, it worked well my problem was that it made two new wifi signals. The Nighthawk Ac had two signals 2g and 5g, so with the Netgear Ac 1200 wifi extender it added two more wifi signals 2gext and 5gext. Most smart devices that is not a problem you set it and for get about it. The phones is what had the biggest problems, knowing which wifi to connect to when and where. So the front of the house worked better with the 2g and 5g while the back of the house worked better with the 2gext and 5gext. It is not a huge problem but I really want a seamless smart home. I was very happy that I got the netgear back working before the google wifi got here. So I feel I was given the chance to compare the two. I figured that I could test it out and still return it for any excuse. The price was a little hard to swallow, because I spent around $200 on the Ac 1900 and $120 on the ac1200 and forgotten to mention the $35 on the n300 wifi range extender. So spending another $300 on a new router was hard. I truly wanted to keep my old set up, that is a lot of money to spend. I am using wink products because you find some of them pretty cheap, wink hubs are cheaper than purchasing two smart switches in my experience. I know if they have the quirky label it is even cheaper. The quirky smart plug is a inexpensive way to control two plugs. The problem with an older technology and will only work with the 2g wifi set up. If you try to connect it to a 5g wifi it will not work. When I connect the google wifi i was very concerned that it only had one wifi signal. I was sure that it wouldn't work with the quirky smart plug. But to much surprise it worked with no problems. I really didn't have any problems hooking up any of my 47 connected devices in our house, yes I said 47 devices. I would definitely advise if you have many devices to label them as soon as you enter them in. Trust me they can get easily lost when you go back and try to label all of your devices. The photos I have provided one to show how many devices and the other is the download capability with two hd videos streaming. I'm very pleased with this purchase, I can say that I put this wifi to its limits and I'm not disappointed. Because they are three devices and none are considered to be the true master. I feel that I the chances of completely be in the dark (no internet) falls solely on my internet provider. If one fails i can move them around to get it working, a smaller wifi signal is way better than no wifi signal. Not to mention that the price for one replacement is cheaper than replacing a \"good router\""}

I'm loving the seamless connection moving from one room to another not having to worry about my device trying to connect to some repeater. One wifi unit on each story seemed to do the trick and the fact that I could always add more for even better coverage is a plus. I wish I would have had this system years ago. This is definitely the way of future home wifi."}

After battling horribly spotty wifi in two homes and with two different carriers (Time Warner and AT&T) we were at our wits end. Paying for \"high speed\" internet and getting barely better than dial-up was getting old. Google Wifi was our last attempt to rectify the situation as our internet providers were unfailingly unhelpful and always shirked any kind of responsibility despite numerous complaints all over the internet (and our neighborhoods) about their outdated equipment and spotty wifi. I hooked it up in a matter of minutes and have not one problem since then. It's been about a month now and somedays running a speed test shows even higher download speeds than our plan offers. We have about a 2100 sq. ft. house and I have found ZERO dead spots. The network automatically picks up the strongest unit and there is no switching over lag like we had with prior extenders. It even lets you quickly set up a guest wifi network so you don't have to give out your passwords. We love Google Wifi and HIGHLY recommend it!"}

Only challenge was that one of the unit's SSID was set to \"148\" with an unknown password, instead of the setup SSID name and password shown on the bottom of the unit. I wonder if I received a previously returned product. This caused the Google Wifi app not to recognize the unit. I did a hard factory reset on the unit (found the instructions online, very easy but took a few minutes to completely reboot), and this solved the problem. Otherwise, very intuitive setup using the app.\n\nI have a ~3000 sq ft single story ranch and the coverage so far seems great. The first unit is connected to the modem on one far end of the house, another unit essentially in the middle of the house, and the third unit on the other far end. This far end had problems with my previous router, and now the coverage seems very strong even though it is \"2 degrees\" removed from the main unit/modem.\n\nI wanted to refute a couple comments i've seen in the reviews:\n1) Some reviews have said that their work VPN's did not work with the system and the Google customer service told them that the system specifically does not work with VPNs. That was the first thing I tested (my company uses PulseSecure VPN) and it worked fine, even faster than my previous Asus router.\n2) I've also seen comments that the security of the system will not work with printers or other wifi devices. So far, my 2 HP wifi printers work fine, as well as my Roku.\n\nThe only customized network setting I am using is a custom DNS to use OpenDNS (to keep the kids off of bad websites).

The whole effort feels like an early prototype that may someday fulfill it's potential. Unless you enjoy being a beta tester, I suggest waiting a year or two. Examole: If you already have a Google OnHub wifi hub, there doesn't appear to be any way to remove it from the phone application (and you can only control this system from your phone; it's a real pain doing network management from a small screen).\n\nFor now, avoid this unless you have never had any network or have only had a wifi network, don't use an ISP that requires a login, don't have wired devices such as printers or backup storage, etc. Google designed this for \"dummies,\" which may turn out to be a good idea. However, that also seriously limits the utility. When installed as a mesh network, which is the intended application, the main unit expects to be connected directly to your Internet connection without an intervening router. Depending upon your ISP and connection, that may or may not be possible. You have little or no control of numerous aspects of the network, including what DNS it uses (Google's???). The list goes on and on, and I'm too tired from fighting with it to elaborate. This is definitely not for anything other than a residence.\n\nWhat I find incongruent is that the mesh system is clearly intended for a large house, but most owners of large houses have already established some kind of networking and some of it is probably wired. The Google system basically requires you to start over and abandon everything that's in place. That simply doesn't make sense. The apparent target audience, people without networking, are more likely to live in apartments or small houses. In that case, this makes the perfect starter system and it's portable enough to just unplug and take to the next place. But a small residence doesn't require a mesh wifi system; a single hub should be sufficient. Bottomline: not yet, but there's hope."}

I asked my friend and he told me he had google wifi. I had to research about it. I thought about all my internet problems I have at home. The google wifi was supposed to help my dead zones and improve my slow wifi off my normal router. Knowing I have these problems, I decided it was worth the money and decided to buy it.\nThe main strengths of the product include easy to set up and climates the dead zones.I have a normal size house and am able to connect to the internet in the backyard. I was never able to do this before I brought this. The set up was extremely easy. There are just a couple plugs and very easy to use. They have an app which does all the installation and information about the google wifi. It also gives the tricks and trip.\nThe main weaknesses of the product include it being white and doesn't improve wifi speeds. I extremely dislike the color white. It does not blend into the colors of my house. It sticks out like a sore thumb. Google needs to improve by making an assortment of color options. My wifi did not improve. I was under the impression that my wifi would be faster. I already knew how slow my internet was. I wish it could help make my internet speed a little bit better.\nI give this 4 stars because of the google wifi does what it meant to do. I know that it is not google's fall that the internet is slow. I also hate the color and I am not able to get over that. I would recommend this to my friends that have bigger houses with a lot of dead zones."}

We have a 2,400 sq. foot, two-story home and a basement, so a mesh network seemed like our best bet. I will say though, our old Linksys WRT54GL was still going strong after 10 years, and put out a great signal. We had no dead areas with that router (though a few weak areas), but it just couldn't keep pace with our upgraded broadband speeds. Anyway, Google Wifi seemed like a safe bet for our house, which was built in 2000. Sadly though, we are returning it.\n\nAs indicated elsewhere, those sleek, white hockey pucks are a breeze to set up and the mobile app (which I didn't mind) is intuitive and easy. While I am tech-savvy enough to set up the traditional routers, I don't love doing so, and usually end up spending a good chunk of time doing web searches for answers about specific settings. With Google Wifi, there is none of that, and I loved it.\n\nBUT. I just couldn't get the mesh network to \"mesh\" well and with a strong signal. I placed those darned satellite pucks all over the house, and would get an initial mesh test of \"good\" to \"very good,\" only to then have it degrade to \"fair\" or \"weak\" in a short period of time. While there was Wifi signal throughout our house, in was weaker in a few areas, and honestly not much better than our old Linksys router! And a couple of times, one of the satellites (closest to the router) actually kicked itself offline despite being within 25 feet of the router, on the same floor, and having no major barriers between.\n\nI called Google Wifi support. To their credit, it was one of the best tech-related troubleshooting calls I've ever made. The tech I worked with actually listened and seemed to thoroughly consider the situation and variables. We went through a lot of different tests and steps to try and determine the issue, with no luck. He escalated the service ticket to additional tech support, but I decided over the weekend that I just didn't want to mess with it any more, so back it goes.\n\nWe ended up purchasing and installing the Netgear Orbi system and wow! While I miss the ease of setup, the great app, and low-profile size of Google Wifi, the Orbi signal is sooo much better in our house. One router and one satellite are supposed to blanket 4,000 sq. feet and it does the job amazingly well. So, if Google Wifi isn't working for you, perhaps consider the Orbi."}

The gamer in our family hasn't noticed any improvement in speed or reliability. The parental controls are nearly useless. You can't schedule down times. You have to hit the pause button every single time. And it was an enormous pain to set up with the router AT&T provides. (The earlier routers are easy, but the ones AT&T provides now aren't set up the same way.) I was really excited about this product, but now I just feel like I wasted hundreds of dollars for nothing."}
{"Author": "William Todd Word", "Date": "on March 19, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Google Wifi - Easy Setup, Fast Wifi, Everything I Wanted!", "Text": "Google Wifi Review\n\nTL;DR version: 48 hours in and I\u2019m absolutely amazed. True to form and other reviews, these things just work, are rock solid, and fast. Very happy with the purchase.\n\nThe longer version for those interested\u2026.\n\nBackground: A while back I got gigabit speed internet here at home. The speed is amazing on my wired iMac, but wifi through my Apple AirPort routers (1x AirPort Extreme, 3x AirPort Expresses acting as repeaters) was leaving something to be desired. Comcast had given me a big Netgear Nighthawk monstrosity as part of the gigabit package and when I tried it out vs. the AirPorts the difference was night and day - the Nighthawk wifi network was multiple times faster than the AirPort network. Come to find out my trusty AirPort network didn't support the newest, latest, greatest wifi standards so simply wasn't as fast as the Nighthawk. And Apple has apparently decided to get out of the router game.\n\nThe Problem: To take advantage of the greater speed, I reconfigured my network to support both the higher speed Nighthawk wifi and the lower speed AirPort network. Why keep both? Because the single nighthawk didn't have enough range to cover my three story, 4,500 sq.ft. house (and the now hard-wired 1,000 sq. ft. guest house) while the multiple AirPort expresses did. So now I had two completely different wifi networks running at two different speeds covering different parts of the house. Not ideal, especially now that I'm more reliant on wifi for my iPhone (T-Mobile's signal in the house isn't great, so my wife and I have been using the really excellent wifi calling feature.)\n\nThe Solution: Today I replaced ALL my routers with four Google Wifi units. The primary wired into the Comcast modem in the office (downstairs), one for the Master Bedroom (2nd level, mesh), one for the guest bedroom (kind of a separate split level thing off to the side, also mesh), and one for the Guest House (hard wired to Ethernet run from the main house). The primary unit connects to a gigabit switch that then connects to several wired devices.\n\nThe Verdict: Only two days in, but so far I'm thrilled. The Google Wifi units form a mesh network that seems to cover my entire house in strong wifi. I haven\u2019t found anywhere in my oddly shaped and sized house that i\u2019m not getting flawless wifi. Some places are \u201cfaster\u201d than others, but even in the \u201cworst\u201d spots I\u2019m still getting at least 40Mbps which I\u2019m not going to complain about. At best, I\u2019m getting 200+Mbps, which definitely isn\u2019t full gigabit but is leagues better than I could get from the AirPorts and on par with the best I\u2019d ever gotten from the Nighthawk\u2026 while covering both houses with a single, uninterrupted network with great signal in every room.\n\nSetup was stupid simple and completely done from the iPhone app. Haven\u2019t had a chance to really play with all of the cool features (internet pause, etc.), but the core functionality is fantastic. I was slightly concerned about functionality since it\u2019s a Google device and we\u2019re all-in on Apple gear (3x Macs, 2x iPhones, 4x iPads, etc.), but almost everything has worked flawlessly (the only glitch was, ironically, with the now Google-owned Nest Thermostats I have - the trick is to reset the network settings on the Nests and re-enter the new wifi info). Every device, wired or wireless, has worked beautifully and the speed is phenomenal.\n\n(As a note and as a point of comparison, I had been a pre-orderer for the Luma mesh wifi system and had briefly tried that out when it finally shipped. I had been greatly looking forward to it and was so disappointed when the units finally arrived. Setup was a nightmare - the stations couldn\u2019t find each other requiring starting over, but then I entered a slightly different name during the process and then it tried to set up two networks, the coverage was bad, and on and on\u2026 The Google Wifi units are everything I had hoped the Luma system would be and more.)\n\nDownsides: Honestly, none that I can really tell so far. I\u2019ve long since given up on caring about being able to tweak every little power user setting in a router, so the options offered by the Google Wifi app more than take care of my needs. It was a little confusing when I hooked up the Guest House unit (wired into Ethernet) as a wifi point because it asked me to unplug the ethernet during configuration but then didn\u2019t really give me any guidance, but it still flawlessly added the unit to the existing mesh network (but now with ethernet backhaul). Placement in my house was a little bit of a pain, but that\u2019s just my house being weird - since you just have to plug in wherever there\u2019s a power outlet it\u2019s about as painless as it can be.\n\nFinal Thoughts: If anything changes or something wonky happens I\u2019ll update this, but otherwise I wholeheartedly recommend Google Wifi. Buy it you\u2019ll love it!"}

And I have four of these discs spreads throughout my house which should give me plenty of coverage. I even have two connected via Ethernet. But my home network goes down CONSTANTLY. I'm talking several times a day I lose connectivity on all my devices. My iphones, ipads, security cameras, my smart tv, my video doorbell. Everything. I am so tired of having to go into their app and restart the routers, and still be left with spotty service after that.\n\nBeyond furious at how unreliable these are. Contacting Google this week to get a fix or a refund."}

I've tried Wi-Fi extenders, Wireless Access Points, and Powerline adapters with little to no success...and then Google Wi-Fi walked into my life. As soon as the device was announced I was ready to pick one up. Once I knew that it would be compatible with the Google OnHub I decided to pick one of them up as well to extend my wireless signal throughout our home and setup a 4 hub mesh network with OnHub and Google WiFi. So I setup the OnHub router first and added each wifi access point to our network. It was much easier than adding a wifi repeater, wifi extender, wifi range extender, wireless repeater, wireless extender, or range extender. The Google WiFi app makes adding wifi points simple and easy. Just open the app, select add wifi point and the app walks you through every step.\n\nAdding the wifi points to the OnHub router allows you to create a mesh network that covers your entire house while allowing your laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other devices to seamlessly switch between the closest access point with the best signal. Google OnHub and Google WiFi points use technology called Network Assist to provide the fastest possible speed. Behind the scenes, Network Assist automatically helps to avoid Wi-Fi congestion, and transitions devices to the closest Wifi point for the best signal.\n\nThe network is then controlled through the Google Wifi app. Use it to share the Wi-Fi password, see what devices are online, and prioritize them for better performance. It also has Google Wifi\u2019s family control which allows devices on the network to be paused. The Google OnHub and Google WiFi points work together to create a strong, dependable wifi network for you and your family.\n\nThe attached video from our YouTube channel -Smart Home Tech- shows the step by step setup process and some speed tests."}
