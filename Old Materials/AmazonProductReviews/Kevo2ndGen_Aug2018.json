We needed a key backup since this is our only door, and if the electronics fail... Otherwise I probably would have gotten a Nest. Works well for me, family, and the help. Even opens with my Verizon Wear24 smart watch, older Nexus 5, 2 Nexus 6 phones, and 2 LG 8\" tablets and keeps track of which user opened or locked the door. I set it to auto relock in 30 seconds when anyone leaves. -1 star for the fob not tracking which one was used, although the fob's do work well (we have several). We don't have the Plus hub yet, but will probably get it so I can issue a temp ekey to maintanance workers if we are out of town. After two months it seems reliable and solid. It is now the only lock we use, and is convenient and faster than our old key locks which we no longer use."}

For first adopters only", "Text": "Unlocking/locking from the kevo app is not reliable. It works most of the time, but sometimes it just does not perform the action. Using this device with alexa kevo home automation skill is even worse, it maybe works 10 - 20% of the time for locking. My kevo plus is maybe 12 ft from the door so that should not be the issue. The kevo lock while a great idea is not reliable in general, and this is just more of the same. The entire product line of kevo (lock, kevo plus, integration with alexa) is very very poorly engineered. Wait until they improve the product (gen3, lock or kevo plus firmware update), or get a different lock."}

The Kwikset lock does everything I want it to do, and is (IMO) better looking and considerably easier to use (I can't speak to the latest versions of August).\n\n- The animated, step-by-step installation guide was super helpful and the box came with everything I needed (except a screwdriver, but that was not an issue).\n- The app, while not perfect, does its job effectively (the \"two factor auth\" setting is in need of some love).\n- Updating the firmware was easy and clear (it works through the app).\n- \"Programming\" (pairing with phones and fobs) works quickly and is literally a one-touch operation (or maybe two).\n- I haven't yet tried sharing e-keys with others so I can't speak to that feature.\n- Tap-to-lock and unlock is kind of magical.\n- The interior deadbolt switch feels like a normal deadbolt (the August lock added resistance and was a giant disc instead of a standard flip switch).\n- Being a Kwikset, it's very easy to re-key the lock if needed (as long as the key you want to replace it with is also a Kwikset key)."}

But while they were doing a group think to try to figure out what was going on (great service, by the way) I was fiddling around in settings and I found it.\n\nTLDR: Settings: General: Restrictions: Bluetooth Sharing: Allow.

In that time I've replaced the batteries in it about 3-4 times and the key fob (which I bought separately) twice. My indication the battery is low isn't a warning light, it just stops working. Also about every couple weeks (or a few times in that week if the battery is low) or so I get a spinning orange ring (which according to the instructions indicates its lost its link to the wifi, which I don't even care about and doesn't seem necessary for the keyfob only use) which makes the whole thing stop working. Then I have to use a key to get in, and take the cover off and remove the battery and put it back in before it works again. It takes about 3-10 seconds to open on any given touch and over time this has \"seemed\" longer and longer. I am tempted, very much, to just stop using its electronic feature and just go back to a key. I got it so I wouldn't have to fumble for my keys when carrying things in and out of my garage entry, but its been barely helpful at that. So then I will have a $200 lock on my door... fantastic!"}

Although my phone was too old to use by itself, I did get a key fob ($25) which worked.\nMy wife (iPhone) had problems from the beginning. While initially it would open the door, after a couple days, the lock would flash red at her and leave her searching for the physical key.\nThen the app started to report that the batteries were low. I tried to replace them but Kevo only wanted to use the original batteries. That's something that will perplex me for years. The new batteries were alkaline, all measured above 1.5v - was it too much power? I'll never know. But putting in the original batteries (after a couple days in the device, they had dropped to 1.3v each) got Kevo up and running again.\nBut then it all went south. Came home to a red light. Replaced the batteries and all I get is an amber spinning lock. Put the original batteries in. Amber spinning. New batteries. Amber spinning. Wait hours, try again. Amber. Leave the batteries in overnight. Amber. Factory reset doesn't work. No help from Kwikset (they regurgitated the Kevo Plus install page). So, this will be the first tech device I've returned in over 20 years."}

Which is infrequent.", "Text": "I've had this lock about a year and half. It worked perfectly for six months, and then a friend told me I should have more than one fob. So I got two more, synced them up with the lock, and it never worked right again. It was on a metal security door. When I touched the door, with no fob and no open phone app in the vicinity, it would spontaneously lock or unlock. I had to hide a key outside because it had a tendency to lock me out.\nGotta give the support service some credit, because they sent me a replacement. That's the one star. The second lock worked perfectly for a little while until it too, had a hissy fit and started failing to respond and open the door, and eventually started locking me out. The third lock they sent me tested out perfectly after I installed it, but the very next day when my tenants tried to get in, it wouldn't open. The security company had to let them in.\nThe fourth lock is on its way to me now. Gotta give them credit for honoring that warranty. Here's the problem, though: they send you refurbished locks when the one you bought fails. So you get a problem lock to begin with after that first one fails. And fail it will.\n\nToo bad. It looks just like a normal deadbolt, no big klunker sitting on your front door, and when it works it's a thing of beauty - to this gadgeteer, anyway. But don't leave home without the key. Sort of undermines the purpose of a fancy - expensive - electronic lock, though. On the up side, it does tend to work with the phone app, even when the fob fails. This doesn't help me with my tenants though, because I give them a fob."}

Once I did this it woks probably 97%. much better that the owner key. I like the convenience but the Bluetooth running in the background suck a lot of battery power.

I was watching an episode of Shark Tank and UniKey was on showing their software for a smart lock. What they demonstrated was exactly what I was looking for. I searched to see if I could find a UniKey supplier and learned that they had licensed this technology to Kwikset which is what is used in the Kevo. I did further research on Kevo and really liked what I saw so, I ordered a lock along with the Kevo Plus. One of the major reasons for shifting to a smart lock was that my wife and kids routinely lost their house key. However, they have never lost their cellphones. So, a smart lock was a win-win.\n\nWhen the lock arrives they suggest downloading and installing the Kevo app on your phone. I highly recommend this because it has great interactive instructions for installing the lock. It took me about 15-20 minutes to install the lock and everything went very smoothly. It was very easy through the app to setup my initial eKey. Please note that you do need to setup an account first before you can generate an eKey. Once the eKey is generated and on your phone the lock is ready to use. You can send additional people eKeys for the lock through email but, each person will need to setup an account with Kevo to accept the eKey. If there is a downside to this lock, this would be it. I would prefer there was a way to send eKeys without the recipient having to download the app but, it has to be setup this way so you can revoke eKeys to people you have sent them to if you choose.\n\nOnce the lock is installed you will most likely see through the phone app that a firmware update is required for the lock. The update process works well but, you have to leave your cellphone within 20 feet of the lock while the update is sent to the lock. Your phone stays unlocked and screen on during the update process. The update for me took about 20 minutes but, worked very smoothly.\n\nI also highly recommend you purchase the Kevo Plus if you are purchasing this lock. The combo is a bit pricey but well worth the money. The Kevo Plus allows you to remotely lock or unlock the door and also see the status of the lock. Great way to lock the door if your kids leave the door unlocked when they leave the house. You can also see which eKeys have operated the lock so, if you are concerned whether your kids have made it home safely you can see that in the history of eKey usage through the mobile app.\n\nThe last thing I will mention is the cybersecurity of the lock. Like most things, smart locks are susceptible to hacking. I watched several YouTube videos and read articles about this lock before purchasing and I couldn't find one where they were able to successfully hack the Kevo. There were articles that mentioned the Kevo key fob had some security issues but, that did not come with my lock and I would not have used it if it had. It is important to install firmware updates when they come out to ensure your lock stays secure. No smart device is 100% hack-proof so, be comfortable with that risk before purchase."}

Unfortunately, it's still full of bugs.\n\nThe main problem is that the software controlling both the app and the lock doesn't work. After adding new batteries to the lock and loading up the software on my phone -- an old school Nexus 6 Motorola (still a fantastic phone) -- the lock and phone established a connection and all was good. I then installed the external lock portion to my door but because my door is older and thicker (2.25\") than modern doors the bolts didn't fit. A \"thick door\" kit is waiting in the wings to be ordered.\n\nSo on to the body and brains of the lock. When the app works the lock works as expected -- it locks and unlocks. However, not too long after its initial test the app started throwing warning about jamming. The problem with that was that that the bolt and the housing were not connected. All the lock needed to do was turn the knob open or closed. Finally the Bluetooth app could no not find the lock and so nothing. Absolutely nothing. Ab.So. Lute. Ly. No.Thing.\n\nRight now, only after a few hours of initially connecting the app to the lock, my phone still cannot find the lock. The lock mechanism itself is sitting right in front of me ... only 2-3 feet away. New batteries. New app installation. Kevo keeps searching and searching and searching and then finally tells me that there's a connection error. No kidding, the lock is sitting right in front of you and you can't find it!\n\nThe build quality seems nice -- metal and plastic as expected. The bolt itself could be thicker and appears to be hollow but the throw is good and will probably withstand a kick or two before the frame gives way. The only problem is that if the software fails then there's no reason to have a \"smart\" lock because you're going to be using your key.\n\nSo I'm going to order the thick door kit and see how it goes. I will update this saga if there's anything worth mentioning. If the Kevo continues to fail then at least I'll have the right bolts to use on a new manual deadbolt."}

We wanted it for the convenience and control it offered with the ability to send scheduled keys to our guests for their stays. We also bought a fob for our housekeepers and the hub so that we could monitor the lock remotely via wi-fi. I was super pumped about this system. My husband was skeptical from the beginning. I talked him into it and defended it over and over again. I am now changing my tune (I hate it when he\u2019s right). This lock has been nothing but trouble since the day we installed it. The app is buggy and needs to be restarted and even on occaision re-installed to operate the lock. Even with the app working properly, the lock still doesn\u2019t respond sometimes. The batteries began to fail less than 3 months after install, despite ensuring that the lock was properly installed and free to move. Many of our guests have found that it isn\u2019t intuitive to use in the first place\u2014the flashing lights and colors are basically meaningless if you don\u2019t have a decoder to tell you what\u2019s going on. We have fielded many late night calls from guests unable to enter the house after a long day, culminating in a call last night because the lock was stuck in an infinite reset loop (spinning amber lights, which according to the Kevo website, means the lock is rebooting). I couldn\u2019t access it remotely during this crisis which completely defeated the purpose of the $100 hub, and the fob didn\u2019t work either\u2014 another $30 wasted. I drove 2.5 hours to let our guests into our condo with the mechanical key at 0130 in the morning. According to the guests who checked out this morning, the lock is still spinning amber, so the batteries will probably die soon as well. Kwikset will be getting a call from me today, but in the meantime, please don\u2019t make the mistake of purchasing this lock. Kevo has a lot of work to do before it\u2019s appropriately useful for this basic necessity of home use.\nI guess the one star is for its aesthetic appeal. It looks nice on the door.

The operator walked me through a few factory resets (which I attempted earlier, before the call) and then the phone support person had to call an engineer to discuss my issue.\n\nAfter waiting on hold, the operator came back on, stating that there is something wrong with the circuit board in my unit. And since I'm not the original owner, I CANNOT GET A REPLACEMENT--the warranty doesn't apply to me.\n\nPlease note that the manufacture date printed on the inside of my unit is from September 2017.

He asked valid questions, asked what we did to make sure both phones were resynced. I explained even after it still unlocked with no phone outside. He assured me that should not happen ever.

Lock works poorly with rechargeable batteries; indicated they need to be replaced even when fully charged. I suspect this is due to the lower fully charged voltage of rechargeable batteries. This is a real inconvenience since the non-rechargeable batteries shipped with the unit only lasted three weeks.\n\n2. Given the frequency of battery replacement needs, it is silly the the entire shroud must be removed to replace the batteries. Batteries should be replaceable by lifting sliding plastic cover.\n\n3. Your iPhone app hangs and/or crashes too frequently while running in the background. I would say the unlock function only works 80-90% of the time first try. This is a pretty poor record. I a running in iPhone X with the most current version of iOS. Hope this gets fixed with future app updates. I may have to try a fob, just to see if it is more reliable."}

Product Design Issues: 1) When the motor which drives the deadbolt into the jam experiences any back pressure it reports a \"jam\" condition to the app, so you never know if the door is locked or not. We have all experienced this resistance when locking manually. you naturally pull or push/pull the door against the insulation slightly to relieve the pressure, and the door locks. 2) can you be sure that all the contractors/service people who need access will have a iphone? Android is only marginally supported. Did you know that all of the people who want to use the Kevo feature have to download an app and register themselves (you know, user name, password, a bunch of security questions, and their phone number) before they can gain access. I'd return this boat anchor if I could, but I waited too long and now I'm stuck with it."}

{"Author": "Cosmo Lee", "Date": "on April 16, 2018", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Warning - Security Risk: A very dumb lock with a *fatal flaw*.", "Text": "I really wanted this lock to work for me but it is too problematic. The biggest problem is that you cannot depend upon it to actually lock your door.\nWhen locking, the unit uses \"dead reckoning\" to decide when it locks. That is, it waits about ~40 seconds after you unlock it, then it locks. What's wrong with that? Well, the lock doesn't actually know that your door is closed, it just extends the deadbolt. (August fixed this with their newer gen locks, btw.) Then it reports a status of \"Locked\" to its app.\n\nBut if the person leaving didn't actually close the door, the door is just sitting there with its deadbolt stuck into the air. The door is *not* locked, as the app status indicates. When the app tells you the door is \"Locked\" you can't believe it's true. And this lock has *no* way of sensing that your door is closed so that it could wait until then before extending the dead bolt. That's why it uses \"dead reckoning\". And as it applies to this lock you understand why the word \"dead\" is in that phrase. That is incredibly *dumb*. I mean, isn't this supposed to be a *smart* lock? This makes it a safety risk. You can't rely on your door actually being locked when the app says so. I'm talking about the 2nd Gen version of this lock. Even the second time around they couldn't figure out that a door has to be closed before it should try to lock it?? So if you have a kid or someone whom you cannot rely on to be sure to positively close your door, you could be unknowingly left with an unlocked door. But this is supposed to be a \"smart\" lock. You shouldn't have to rely on people to do the job correctly, the lock is supposed to be smart and make sure the job gets done, right? A truly smart lock should be able to tell you, \"Hey, the door couldn't be locked.\" It shouldn't mislead you with false positives. FAIL.\n\nWhat about having an automatic door closer on your door? Glad you asked, because that's exactly what I have. Automatic door closers can get stuck. With a change in the weather it may not close in the allotted 40 seconds before the dead bolt extends. Or something could block the door from closing completely - a rug could bunch. All kinds of things could happen. What about the touted features of having the convenience of being able to unlock the door from remote or give out eKeys to let the delivery person/dog walker/etc in? They could forget to pull the door completely closed - this lock has no way of knowing that the door is ajar, and it will blithely tell you via the app that the door is \"locked\". Now imagine that you get home later that day to find that because your door has been left open, your place has been ransacked or your pet has run away!\n\nOthers have written about the incompatibility issues with the phone software. I can confirm this. I've had to give out dongles to those whose phones won't work with the lock. The lock provides logs to show you who has unlocked the lock with an ekey to enter your premises. The problem with the dongles is that the lock does not report when a person uses one - no log entry. You can't associate a particular dongle with a specific person. So if you need to keep tabs on who is entering a space and need to give someone a dongle, forget about knowing when a person comes into the space. Even with the ekeys, the logs often don't show an entry for a person unlocking the lock - it's simply missing.\n\nThe other thing is that the number of dongles you can use with a lock is limited to 8. Need more? Forget about it, you can't, Kevo doesn't support it. What if someone loses a dongle or you want to selectively disable a dongle. You can't. You have to reset your lock. But this deletes *all* dongles and ekeys from your lock. You then have to reissue all your ekeys and dongles to your people. Talk about inconvenient.\n\nSpeaking of inconvenient, let's talk scheduling. One of the touted features of smart locks is the ability to give persons selective access to the lock. But the Kevo scheduling is very limited. It can be for any specific day, but not for different times. So if you want to provide the cleaning person access on Monday, between 7-9am, and on Friday between 3-6pm, you can't. You can only provide selective day access at the exact same time period. EG: Monday 7-9 and Friday 7-9, but 7-9 is all you get. Only the same time schedule for different days. You also can't provide two different access times for an a given day. Say you want the dog walker to be able to come in Monday betw 7-9am and also 3-6pm. Can't do it. You can't do two schedule periods on the same day. You would have to provide access for the total span, 7am-6pm. Dongles can't be scheduled at all. They are always 24x7.\n\nOh yea, my unit died early on. It had to be completely swapped out under warranty. This did not inspire confidence. And the batteries died without the lock giving me any forewarning. If I hadn't had my physical key I would have been locked out.\n\nI will be replacing this lock."}

On an Android phone, there is a key icon in the upper left of the display showing you that it's running. You don't get that on an iPhone. The Kevo app needs to be running in the background on your smartphone in order to unlock the lock. In the beginning, their software had more bugs, but they've improved it, and it's gotten more reliable. While hold time was a little long with tech support, they did manage to fix any trouble shooting issues that I had. The lock has worked well for my family and I. The problem I have is that the Kevo app has not always been consistent (it's gotten better over time). The app tends to unlock and lock the door better with an Android phone (which my wife uses), than an iPhone (which I use). On an iPhone you have to make sure that the app is running in the background, so that it will work. However, even when the app is running in the background, I find that the lock will not lock or unlock when I touch it, as it is supposed to. Many times, I've had to take out my phone, open the Kevo app, and then lock or unlock the door lock via the app over WiFi. I always update my phone and apps, and I use a high-end & high-speed Mesh WiFi network. The lock's app software lacks consistency, as sometimes it will work with the phone in your pocket, and other times, I have to retrieve the phone from my pocket, and lock or unlock the door over WiFi using the app. I forgot to mention that I have the Kevo Plus accessory, that allows for control over WiFi and cellular via the smart phone. Tech support had me reset the lock, and lock and unlock the lock 10 times with my phone over Bluetooth, so that the lock would pair \"better\" with my phone. That seemed to help the consistency of using the Kevo app, but still not 100%."}

Better results seem to be had if I'm almost humping my front door which I'd prefer to have to do than have it work when my phone is 30 feet away in the closed garage( on the outside of the lock) under a car too far away to hear the person helping themselves to whatever they fancy. Unlike most, I don't expect perfect technology (I still remember the first Terminator movie) so a glitch here or there is not a show stopper but I think the manufacturer should be working to fix the range issues. Finally, there is the ridiculous kevo plus. ridiculous because I shouldn't have to spend another $100 to get remote access when I can open my older Kwikset with my hub.

The system for sharing keys is very flexible and easy to use, but they need to work on the lock.\n\nMy guess is that they need to rewrite the app and simplify the handshake between the app and the lock. The way it works now, the app has to connect with the lock so it can show locked or unlocked status. 99.99% of the time, this is pointless, as you are actually located at the locked door and just want to get in. Why does the phone have to \"know\" if the door is locked?? Instead it should just let you send a lock or unlock signal to the device. Two-way communication could be reserved for when (if) you connect to the lock remotely over the web. Stupidly over-complicated software that fails too often. So unnecessary.

This is the first major manufacturer that did not even respond to my complaint, abridged below. I think Kwikset knows this product is a real dud but is pushing through anyway, which is very disappointing.\n\nWhen I first purchased it as a Christmas gift at the end of 2016, it was great. The install was seamless, and the reliability was very high. Then, seemingly related to iOS updates that changed the Bluetooth protocol, everything started breaking down, and Kevo became increasingly less dependable. Over the past year, we basically gave up on using the touch function completely and went back to using the key. At $200 per unit, this is an extraordinarily expensive deadbolt.\n\nI have carefully calibrated, re-calibrated, reset and reinstalled completely, many, many times. Sometimes it's better for a while, but then it stops connecting until I reset again. I do not need further technical instruction as I have spent hours of time researching and attempting to correct this issue. I am amazed that Kwikset is continuing to sell this product, especially as I see the negative reviews with the same issues popping up regularly. This is a real disservice to Kwikset customers who were willing to invest more in hope of enjoying a smart product that delivers on its promise.\n\nRegardless of whether this is Apple or Bluetooth, or whatever is responsible for the destabilization of Kevo, I think it\u2019s Kwikset\u2019s responsibility to recall and refund a product that is not working. For now we continue to mostly use standard keys, and my family is frustrated. When we do switch to a keypad or other lock in the future, Kwikset has lost our business completely."}

Their solution was they would send me a dead bold which I could install, send the defective unit back, wait a couple days to get a replacement, un-install the dead bolt reinstall the Kevo, send back the dead bolt......\n\nI told them if I had to take it off without the replacement in hand I was returning it to HD - which is what I did\n\nAll in all a cool idea that is not yet ready for real life use.....

This can be very useful if you don\u2019t really like having a giant keychain then owning a Kevo device is the way to go. This could be a problem for those of you who don't like to carry unnecessary weight to carry around. The main thing that is needed for the Kevo app to work is a Kevo which is a type of lock that can be put on the door. The Kevo app is reliable most of the time and most of the times that you go to open your door it will unlock. Kevo at times is not as reliable as you want it to be. Sometimes the connection of the app doesn't catch which won\u2019t open the door. This can lead to you needing to use that actual key to open your door to get into your house. Another potential drawback to the app is that you will have a notification on your phone that the Kevo is active which may get annoying to people that don\u2019t like to see notifications. Creating an account is a very simple process and you can send your key to other family members or friends that have the app. The user interface for the Kevo app is simple and shows you the keys that you have and a button at the top that gives you the usual commodities like settings and help. At the bottom of the screen there is a plus sign that allows you to setup your Kevo to the app. If people coming into your house with the Kevo is not something you want you can set a curfew on the app which disables activity during those hours. Though the Kevo app may not be as reliable at times it is a great commodity to have when owning the Kevo lock."}

The review got delayed further because it spontaneously stopped working. I went through customer support and they determined that it was broken, I sent it back and they sent me a replacement. That one also didn't work. Another round of customer support, another broken device. I sent it back and they sent me a THIRD one. This one more or less works. Here's the highlights:\n\nTHE GOOD\nThe concept is really cool. When you have arms full of groceries its really nice not to have to fish for keys. Sending virtual keys to people is really handy. My 3 year old loves being able to unlock the door.\n\nTHE BAD\nResponse can be a little pokey. I would say it works properly about 70% of the time, the rest it needs more taps or sometimes even opening the app, which leads me to.....\n\nIn order for it to work the Kevo app has to be open in the background of your phone. The problem is that at any moment iOS can kick your app out of memory if it needs it to run other apps. This isn't as much of a problem for me since I have a newish phone with a lot of memory, but my wife has a 6c and the app is constantly getting booted, which means it is almost useless for her. Opening the app and waiting for it to find the lock takes longer than just using the key.\n\nLast complaint - this thing rips through batteries. I have to replace them every couple of months. I tried using rechargables but it burned through those in a matter of days. Replacing the batteries requires unscrewing the case which is a bit of a hassle since it happens so frequently.\n\nBottom line is this is a cool new tech, but its not ready for prime time. Wait for them to work out the kinks. If you want a keyless entry I much prefer the Schlage BE365VCAM619 Camelot Keypad Deadbolt. Its cheaper and more reliable."}

Had it for 3 weeks and it would have left me locked out 6 times had I not had a key. Have returned it to Amazon (no hassle) and bought the Schlage Sense which has been working flawlessly for a week now.\nOriginal review: I bought 2 locks for 2 doors in the same home. Installation was simple. Took my time and followed the directions to the letter with the first one and it took about 30 minutes. The second one took literally less than 10 minutes. Was able to easily re-key both locks so they would work with he same key.\nInitially both locks works perfectly. Then one would not work. Called K\u0113vo and the tech was great. Got me up and running in nothing flat. I am using an iPhone 7plus with the latest Apple software installed. He had me close all my apps, close the Kevo app and turn off my blue tooth for 15 seconds. When I started it back up everything was fine. 2 days later I had the same problem with both locks at the same time and they would not work with either my phone or my wife\u2019s phone. Went through the close apps, turn off bluetooth, wait 15 seconds and restart. Did it twice without success. Called Kevo and they got me going again. They blamed Apple and the latest update. Quite frankly I see a hardware blaming software and software blaming hardware scenario in the making. I would hate to think I spent this much money for a simple deadbolt. Bought a lockbox for an emergency key just in case! I am very disappointed. If I can go along without an issue I will revise my rating.\nWell, after 3 weeks of ownership and being potentially locked out of the house more times than I can count, I have initiated my return of these locks to Amazon. As soon as my new Schlage Sense smart locks arrive and are installed, these are going back. Thank you Amazon Prime for the great customer service and making the return a smooth and hassle free experience (even though I no longer have the original packaging)."}

You can also give out eKeys over the Internet using the Kevo Plus. The device works well, easy to setup and hasn't failed me yet.\n\nThe bad points:\n1) Costs $100 for basic Internet operations. For Smart Devices this is pretty ridiculous as everything needs Internet for integration.\n2) Only Bluetooth - since there are no Smart Hubs which offer Bluetooth management of Smart Devices you have to shell out $100.\n3) You need a network cable to your router. Sadly the Kevo Plus is NOT a wifi device. This can be an issue since you have to plug it into your Wifi router AND you have to be close to all your locks. Getting a Wifi repeater with a LAN port close to your Kevo Plus can solve this, but not too close as Bluetooth is the same frequency at 2.4 GHz wifi. Also introduces other issues such as wifi channel congestion if you don't have a MIMO repeater and latency over the Wifi. At $100 this device should have a Wifi antenna at 5 GHz so it doesn't stomp on the 2.4GHz Bluetooth antenna.\n4) Still need to use the App. Even with Internet connectivity there is no website for Kevo management.

Since they already had a Kwikset dead-bolt, I noted in the online documentation that this lock could be re-keyed to use their existing physical key if needed. My brother-in-law was able to install it without any issues and I received an automated email at one point with a link to download the electronic key for the lock. I have an iPhone 6S Plus so I downloaded the Kevo app from the app store, created an account with Kwikset so that I could login and activated the electronic key on my account.\n\nUsing it is very simple. Your phone needs to have Bluetooth turned on and the application has to be active. Then you simply touch the collar of the lock. It will light up with a rotating blue light and if it successfully unlocks, the collar will turn green and you will hear the bolt retract. Locking from the outside is the same. Touch the collar and wait. If it locks successfully, the collar will turn red. Note that you can also lock and unlock the door from the app directly without having to touch the lock.\n\nIf you do not have your phone or for some reason it is not working correctly, you can still use a physical key. Kwikset has a setup procedure to easily rekey the lock to your existing Kwikset key. Once that is done, your physical key will open and close the lock."}

You should look at the install video on kwikset's web site. It will let you know how to install, it's not that difficult, at least wasn't for me. I bought the Kevo Hub. I plugged the unit it, sure enough it's red. The documentation on Kevo's website says ports need to be open. I am guessing that for most people, Kevo Hub will be setup easily without opening ports (if it does not turn red, you may want to look at your router's security - too many ports open - not a really good thing). Well, I plug the Hub in after opening ports. It's blinking white, almost looks like a white-blueish color. Waiting for the blue color so the Hub says it's ready. It was taking a long time to turn blue, so I just gave up and left it plugged in overnight. Wake up in the morning, and the Kevo Hub is blue. I followed the documentation, it's not difficult, and really surprised how easy the process was (almost scary easy - I really thought I had this not working with the blinking white). The interesting part is when I finished with the setup, and I cannot remember if I waited for the blue or just gave up and tried it. It told me the lock was too far. I was afraid of this. To my surprise, the lock still works over the Internet with the lock being far from the Kevo Hub (maybe 75 to 100 ft). It may be convenient to open and close the lock one day, so I figured I would get another lock. Ah, this one, the installation not so smooth. This is not why I gave it four stars, I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. The reason for no 5 stars is, I sure would like a log for when someone opens the lock with a key without the Bluetooth or Internet. Ok, back to difficult second install. The lock feels like it's jamming, this is before I setup the Bluetooth Key. I'm trying to figure out what it jams. I run the setup anyway. The App tells me the lock jams. No surprised to me. Better yet, the App gives you step by step instructions on how to get it working! I would not put three screws on the cover when getting this setup. I put the screws on and off so many times, I lost count. I had to delete the e-key and reinstall; however, after the steps, the lock works perfectly. I am wondering why some said the batteries drain. It could be the non-smooth operations of the lock, I am guessing. After the unjamming instructions, the lock is really smooth. I thought the issue was mechanical; however, maybe the lock fixed itself. The rekey option, I love it. More details: Android, Moto G5 (not happy with the phone with security - nothing to do with Kevo or Kwickset - strictly the phone) and Samsung S8. It works with both brands. It was easy to move from phone to phone, if you wrote down your username and password. I use complex password phrases, never short - security important. One more thing, maybe you may want a UPS for Hub, router, etc. It's amazing how things don't work when there is no power. Remember always carry your key, nice to have a backup for the convenience, and no UPS needed for the physical key."}

Since it was past its return timeframe, I pulled it apart to see if I could identify the problem. Apparently, the wire that attached the programming panel had broken somehow. I don't know if this is something that I accidentally cause during install or how it happened. I soldered the wire back onto the control board ensuring the solder did not come into contact with any of the other contacts or grounds on the board. Once complete and reinstalled, it because to function properly from the phone commands. However, the touch sensor for the lock activated the ring light but did not activate the lock.\nSince I am past the point of no return on the lock, I would appreciate a little technical support for what else could be wrong with it so that I can attempt to fix it. If it wasn't for the multiple issues with the functions, the lock is an incredible idea and the perfect addition to any home. But I would like to see the newer models have a more rugged internal design and have better reliability and distance programming functionality."}

Reviews don't lie.", "Text": "It looks beautiful and when it worked it was great. But it often didn't work. I never had to spend so much time troubleshooting an analog lock before, I don't think the additional features of this digital lock at all made all this headache worth it. I should have heeded the low ratings here on Amazon. I figured they were all due to fluke or user error but I'm on my second K\u0113vo lock (a replacement) that still does not work and I am no luddite.\nProblems we have had:\n\u2022 The first fob I got immediately stopped working. Call to customer service suggested battery was dead. On a brand new battery. This turned out to indeed be the case.\n\u2022 Brand new batteries in the main lock itself were immediately drained. Replaced with rechargeable batteries which also immediately drained. Call to customer service suggested to only use brand name batteries and not rechargeable ones.\n\u2022 Lock several times lost its pairing with my phone (which was the 'owner'). I had to do factory resets twice and set up the lock again, which meant everyone who had a digital key needed a new one.\n\u2022 Lock suddenly stopped recognizing the signal from my phone and fob. I had to run out and make copies of the physical key so I could leave the house to go to work that day. Call to customer service suggested another factory reset. I suggested no, not again, I just want a lock that works. They said I was outside the warranty window. I said that's BS because it was at least my third call to them about this faulty POS (I used nicer language on the phone) and the first calls were within the warranty period. They suggested they might be able to make an exception for me and while they were working that out I realized that my warranty was definitely not up yet. So they sent me a new lock, which I had to pay for and will only get my money back when I return the old lock. Meanwhile they didn't send it right away and I only received it after Thanksgiving, my busiest time at work, so they started sending me warnings that the charge would become irreversible unless I called for an extension. I called for an extension and they said I was fine with a new shipping label. Then they sent me an email saying they charged me anyway.\n\u2022 Now I'm trying to set up the new lock and it absolutely will not pair with my phone. So I'm waiting for customer service to call me back and am debating whether to take apart the replacement and reinstall the previous faulty one because at least everyone had physical keys to that one."}

It works pretty well. I docked it one star since its not completely without flaws. For example, one time I had to yank the battery and plug it back in after the LED stopped lighting up. Sometimes it takes a while before it throws the bolt. I assume its looking for an ekey, and it just takes a few seconds to connect. My wife dislikes that since she can just use a key much quicker. But I personally use it as an Elock all the time. I've used it in conjuction with my Ring doorbell to let in family. I love that I can share an ekey with contractors instead of handing them a physical key. Along with this I purchased the web hub and two key fobs. You need the web hub to be able to use the lock (and check its status) when you're not at the house. In my opinion, the lock looses half its functionality without that. Either way, I am happy with it, and I would certainly buy another."}

I do love the touch to open and not having to dig around for key in the dark (assuming I forgot to leave lights on - also something I am looking to make smarter). However, there are some issues. For about every third time I use it, I touch it- the lock blinks and thinks and decides it is not sure so it doesn't unlock -I touch again -the lock thinks and then finds me standing there, and lets me in. This isn't the end of the world but annoying just the same. Also, it eats batteries. I went and got rechargeable set of batteries (takes 4) for the lock which isn't too bad although they don't seem to last as long as the regular kind. My big annoyance with the battery pack is that you have to take the screws out of the case on the back of the door to get the battery pack out! Why the unit was designed to have an access panel for a reset button but the same panel does NOT let you pull the battery case is beyond me. My recommendation - keep looking."}

I have less than 12/day and my batteries lasted a little over four months before they needed to be replaced. Replacing batteries is a total PITA because you essentially have to take the unit off the door with a screwdriver to get to the battery compartment. Expensive.

After I purchased it and other HomeKit items this feature was removed and works solely with the Nest thermostat which can then help it to be HomeKit compatible. I purchased the Ecobee thermostat around the same time as this and they were supposed to work together. It seemed once Schlage released their HomeKit lock everything changed and Ecobee and Schlage work together but not K\u0113vo. This became extremely inconvenient especially after paying full price for the K\u0113vo lock and then an extra $99 for the upgrade to connect with wireless not just Bluetooth. As of late tapping on the deadbolt which should unlock and lock the door no longer works. Each time I come or leave home I have to pull out my phone, open the app and manually tap the icon to unlock or lock. This goes completely against what the lock was purchased for. It would take less time to unclock it with a key than my phone at this point. I am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied right now. The batteries seem to run out very quickly and sometimes the lock just doesn\u2019t work which literally requires me to climb my deck and go in through my sliding door. The product is very glitchy and I feel I wasted my money with the purchase. The concept is amazing by allowing you to go keyless and send or take away electronic keys as needed to family members or guests. But it seems it was rushed and the system is not being maintained as it should. I really would rather switch to the Schlage lock but it\u2019s hard to justify throwing the money for the K\u0113vo out of the window. I\u2019m at the point of giving it a few more months to feel I may have gotten my money\u2019s worth and then making the switch."}

This is so frustrating to think I can unlock the door with my now wiggly toddler in my arms & any other after work bags & then i stand in front of the door touching the lock multiple times before juggling the toddler to dig through my bag to find my actual key (which I would have in my hand if I didn\u2019t have the expectation of a keyless entry). We\u2019ve had it for ~1.5 yrs. and I think I hate it a little more each day.

This includes the KEVO hub that I later ordered for $100 to be able to get access to the lock remotely and away from home.

Yes I have the background app refresh enabled, bluetooth sharing enabled, app runs in the background OR runs in the foreground and the app has access to location services ALWAYS. I have tested it all. The touch-to-open is inconsistent and works about 30% of the time. I have to refresh bluetooth connection and/or recalibrate the lock however it is inconsistent. It is more of a pain in the ass to get this going and is much much easier to just open the damn lock with the key. I have had this lock for about 90 days and I feel totally defeated out of my $350. The manufacturer is slow in app updates. Requires app to be in the background however if you have multiple apps in the background then it is up to IOS to shut the older ones down from RAM. At that point, the touch-to-open does not work and you have to re-open the app and this whole process slows you down. Faster to use the actual Key. The app has consistent issues with refreshing the bluetooth connection and actually making a secure connection for touch-to-open to work. For a $350 setup, this lock and its software is a failure.\nSo, this 90 day experiment has exhausted me to make this thing work like it is supposed to. I will not settle for mediocracy for $350 and therefore will be uninstalling this lock and going with another lock that works near flawlessly. Several other good brands come to mind.

There's already enough details of the lock itself floating out there..\n\nThe first unit I received, I spent about 20mins to install. Great, that was a cinch. Typical door lock uninstall/install process. It's after the hardware installation that's where the nightmare came in, and it took about 3.5hrs. I had issues after issues from trying to get the unit to pair with the app (\"try to reset and push 'A' and register again\"), then the many attempts to update the firmware on the unit (\"there was an error updating your lock!\"), and the the aggravation of the app itself not getting the bluetooth (low-energy) signal from the unit itself after the pairing. Btw, I've tried in vain with several phones I have (Samsung S7 & S8, Moto G4, OnePlus 3T). In the end, I conceded to the lock, but, I speculated it's a lemon I just purchased. So......I returned the unit, which Amazon always makes amazing, and get this, I exchanged it for a replacement. Stubborn, right? But I gotta see this through.\n\nOk, I took receipt of the second unit the following day, thanks to Amazon's awesome Prime ship service. Long story short, this time, I literally had the same experience and hair-pulling. One thing I noticed however, which concerned me was that this unit looked used. Seems like this is a refurbished unit--I can tell by the subtle scratches here and there that someone had already played with it. Not sure how quality control is conducted over at Kwikset, but my guess, sub-par or nil. And yeah, a \"told you so\" sign should be hung around my neck for even trying the second time.\n\nIn summary, I really, really wanted this second unit to work. I like the idea of having such a convenient smart lock for my family when we're locked out or give family/friends accesses remotely. But why am I putting myself through this? Simple, I'm on a mission to get a working smart lock so I don't have to keep coming home because my boy forgets his key. I haven't given up; I will find that right smart lock."}

{"Author": "Technologist", "Date": "on August 18, 2017", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "How bad could they make it?", "Text": "I so want to give this a great review. At first it was OK. It's sometimes convenient. You get to the door, touch the lock, wait a few seconds, and then... sometimes it unlocks. Performance got better after a firmware upgrade, but the last \"upgrade\" has been a total downgrade.\n\nSo you may have a car key that stays in your pocket, you touch the door or wave your foot and the thing works instantly, 100% reliably AND you can't lock yourself out. Well this lock is NOTHING like that.\n\nOn a good day it opens. On a bad day several tries that take several seconds each all fail. You then either have to get out your key, which would have been far far faster, or open the Kevo app. The Kevo app has to remain open on the iPhone. But it's chance of working deteriorates the more apps you have running. More than 5 or 6 and your lock probably won't respond.\n\nThen the real problems.\n\n1. Brushing the lock accidentally - you'd never guess how often that happens and you unintentionally lock or unlock the door.\n2. Getting home and finding the door unlocked. Before the latest software update you could tell from the phone who unlocked or locked the door. Now the software ONLY shows in its history who last LOCKED the door. Why this change? My only guess is its a liability to them recording unlocks.\n3. Mechanism jams. Our lock now seems to be jamming internally. It can be hard to manually lock or unlock even with the door open (so it has nothing to do with the mating hole for the deadbolt.\n4. Since the last software update, battery life has become 1-2 weeks. The first set of batteries lasted about 6 months.\n5. Replacing the batteries: Hard to believe, but it takes a few minutes and involves removing three screws. If, like your car remote, the battery lasted a few years that wouldn't be so bad, but every couple of weeks?\n6. Lock / Unlock is performed the same way - touch the lock. What would have been sensible would be to touch the outside of the lock to lock, and the barrel (the key area) to unlock. This would mean you don't accidentally perform the opposite of what you intended, or when there are two of you leaving at the same time, one locks the door and the other unlocks it.\n\nWhen car door locks do it so flawlessly well with keyless entry, how can this be so so bad?\n\nA much as you might want the convenience, this lock is badl Sometimes it's convenient. Sometimes you stand there with your arms full waiting and waiting. Sometimes you get home and the door isn't locked and, with the latest software, you can't even see when or who unlocked it in the history."}

I have spent HOURS calibrating, resetting, and experimenting trying to get this stupid thing to work. The software update times out at zero percent. I've read the FAQ on such and your \"fix\" of tapping the dial to avoid the timeout is laughable at best as it does NOTHING. The lock even after calibrating does not open unless the phone is in my hand less than 2 feet away directly in front of the lock - NOT in my pocket, or a bag or a purse. This defeats the entire purpose or benefit of your product. Still even with the phone in my hand, the lock responds to my touch MAYBE 1 in 2 or 3 attempts.

It was always a little slow to lock and unlock. The 2nd Gen is impressively fast. True it doesn't always lock right away, but 90% of the time I feel it's locking within 3 seconds. There's been a few glitches where it stopped flashing once, but it resolves itself.\n\nThe only reason I dinged it a star is because I felt the old version was much more convenient to change the batteries on - a task that was required maybe every 6 months. The Gen 1 lock just had a compartment that slid off. This one is a little less convenient in that it has 3 tiny screws, but it's fine.\n\nIf you aren't a slightly technically inclined, or patient person - this lock isn't for you.

Getting the flipping thing paired? Monumental headache.\nWant to avoid some of these headaches? Here's some hints:\n1) Charge your phone to 100% before you start - they have you push an update to the device upon connecting to lock.\n2) Read how to Factory Reset the device before you start - If your pairing fails at any point in the process, you will need to do this to fix it.\n3) Have at least 30 minutes free without your phone - it will take that long for that blasted update to arrive, and you can't even use your phone, or minimize the app while the update is running.\n4) You should seriously set up the lock's software/app bits before you install it into your door. It will let you get set up before you install it.\n5) Do the SmartKey change over BEFORE you install the lock! I am unable to use any key right now, because of this.\n6) The App is poorly written for its use and does not request any permissions if you've secured your phone.

NADA.\nI assumed that it needed location, FAIL. Enabled all permissions, FAIL. Restarted phone, FAIL. Pulled battery pack and reran handing, FAIL. Only fix is to factory reset, and Setup a Device all over again, with full permissions enabled, just to pair it properly. THEN it slapped me with the update, while my phone is all of 25% charge, you can't move more than 20 feet away with the phone, or start over later, or anything else - just wait it out.\n\nNow that the update is installed, and the lock is working, I opted to re-key with SmartKey. STUPID IDEA. Why? The touch lock kicked off while inserting the new key and it twisted the lock while it wasn't all of the way in, so now NO KEY works at all. ARGHH!\n\nRecap: Connection software QA: FAIL, go take a pay reduction or work in CustomerSupport for a month and fix everyone's problem. Update software QA: Annoyingly slow and no hope when it comes to firmware - maybe tell people HOW LONG it will take to update before forcing their hand?

Which doesn't does sound bad, but I suppose I'll feel differently this winter...\n\nOtherwise, I love the lock. The capability of emailing keys is great, I don't need a key when I run, and I can see exactly what time my dog walker stops by. I also like that it looks like an ordinary lock which is great for our historic neighborhood. I'd highly recommend for a family that's constantly loosing keys, or for anyone who wants to tech-up their home without a super-tech look."}

Well, out of the box the lock worked about 60 to 70% of the time, to times taking more than 3 or 4 tries to open the lock at about 5 seconds at least per attempt. Now after a few months I can safely say all I have is a deadbolt that has bright colors spin around it while I unlock it with my key. It does not work at all, the lock spins in blue attempting to unlock it for about 10 seconds then gives me a nice orange circle that spins. Never works now. This is an absolute piece of garbage, please do yourself a favor and don't think you will be one of the people this may work for.

Let's count the ways...", "Text": " Kwikset Kevo (2nd Gen) Touch-to-Open Bluetooth Smart Lock, Works with Amazon Alexa via Kevo Plus, in Satin Nickel\n\nI really wanted to have kevo work. It had all the attributes I wanted (geo boundary, ability to use my old keys, respected manufacturer, WiFi accessibility). I didn't like that I had to pay half the price of the already expensive smart lock to get WiFi, but again, I wanted it to work...\n\nNOTE: I made four videos (referred to below), they are all combined in the single attached video.\nNOTE: I refer to the kevo installation documentation, but I can't post a link to them (Amazon review guidelines). You can find them with a search for kevo gen 2 installation.\n\nHow many things can go wrong with a simple replacement of a lock from the same manufacturer? Let's count the ways:\n\n1) Unclear instructions on which latch to use.\n\nI had to use the \"Drive-in latch\" instead of the latch with the faceplate. There was not enough room, needed shorter latch (60mm backset). Instructions refer to chiseled or not, in my case the chisel had nothing to do with it. The instructions don't mention the latch with the rectangular faceplate has a 70mm backset which the \"Drive-in latch\" has a 60mm backset. My previous Kwikset lock had a rectangular faceplate but a 60mm backset.\n\n2) Cable did not fit through hole in mounting plate.\n\nInstructions say to \"route cable through the center hole\" on the mounting plate. In the Instruction video at about 2:10 it shows an animation simply pushing the cable connector through the plate. In my case the hole in the mounting plate was too small (and even looks too small in the video, see screen captures \"Connector entering plate\", \"Connector in plate\", \"Connector leaving plate\"). My experience can be seen in the video, \"kevo connector bigger than hole\".\n\nWanting to give kevo the benefit of the doubt, and the fact that the mounting plate is a simple steel plate where the hole has no significant mechanical or electrical impact, I filed out the hole enough to pass the connector (see the video \"kevo connector with modified mounting plate\"). Problem solved, I thought, although in my zeal for finishing I may have violated the warranty (but, it's just a little metal, I thought).\n\n3) The control shaft in the kevo was (mostly) upside down\n\nThe installation video says to make sure the turn piece on the interior assemply is in the vertical position (at about 2:30, see screen capture \"Turn piece vertical\"). Note the little diamond is pointing up. In my case the turn piece is upside down (see video \"kevo turn piece rotation\" and screen capture \"kevo turn piece upside down\"). I thought about turning the latch upside down in the door (it was installed correctly, see \"latch is UP\"), but I was concerned something else would go wrong and just wanted to test it.\n\nIn any case this meant that I could not actually mount the kevo interior assembly correctly. At this point I wanted to test it, which meant I had to install the interior assembly upside down on the door.\n\n4) The kevo automation sort of works, but even installed upside down the shaft is turned so that it doesn't actually retract the bolt all the way.\n\nI tried \"handing the deadbolt\", following the installation video at about 3:22. In my case I never heard the \"long beep\" after installing the battery pack, despite holding the button for more than 3 seconds (see video \"Handing the deadbolt\"). The installation video suggests the beep would happen while holding the button, the written instructions more accurately reflect my experience.\n\nNote the installation video shows the deadbolt retracting and extending twice, followed by two green flashes from the LED. For me the deadbolt attempted to retract once, got about 80% closed then whined as it tried to finish. Then it extended followed by a beep and gave a single green flash. So it kinda looked like it worked, but it didn't really work right as it cannot actually retract the deadbolt completely.\n\n--------\n\nGiven all that it may not be reasonable to try again, but as I said I really want this to work. I documented everything, reinstalled my old lock, and now I'm trying to see how to get another kevo and try again. That is, if they don't void my warranty because I modified the mounting plate that didn't actually work with the connector."}

Key: Thank goodness it has keys or you won't get in your house. Install: about the same install time as a normal deadbolt. Can make the inside housing cover easy to remove by removing a screw from inside the cover, you will need to do this because you will be resetting this lock a lot. Rekey: comes with a rekey function so you can match keys to the rest of the locks in your house.\nThe Bad: where to start... one of the inside housing screws is at the bottom of the housing, if you are normal your deadbolt is above your door handle, hard to get a screw driver in there. That's just dumb. App: app is crude at best and slow to connect if you go out of range of the lock Bluetooth. If you park in driveway like I do, by the time you pull up, walk to door, open door with key, grab a beer and make a sandwich, you may have connected with the lock. Oh by the way the app has to be open on your phone before you arrive too, the three tap function only works if app is running on your phone as well. That's a fail. I have had this thing installed for a week and it has \"lost connection\" three or four times, I.e. You have to reset the lock and set it up again. This involves taking the back cover off, removing the battery pack, holding your phone up to it while putting one finger on the reset button and putting another finger on the top of your head. When it loses connection you get a continuous flashing amber led circle on the outside of the lock, this is annoying enough that you will get the screwdriver out... sad. Oh I almost forgot, if you want to remotely control the lock you will need to buy an additional hub, only available from kevo website $105 includes shipping. I ordered it the day I got the lock, been a week it's not here yet. Do yourself a favor, avoid, I would say any other lock will work better than this one, I'm not sure they even tested this thing, if you google 'amber light on kevo' you get no hits, so don't expect any support. Sorry this thing gets a hard earned one star."}

Heck, I bough the first generation one and then replaced it with this one because I keep hoping it will do everything it promises. But it never really does. I can't recommend it.\n\nThe lock software and app are not often updated, and they feel clumsy to use (even after the most recent update) and unreliable. It works about 50% of the time first time, and maybe 80% of the time second time. Sometimes I can stand there for a while tapping the thing to make it open. If I get my phone out and open the app (which appears to have often stops running in the background for unknown reasons) it will open 99% of the time, but the point is that I shouldn't have to do that. Somehow it seems to do this when I'm carrying two bags of groceries.\n\nThen there's the battery life which is worse after the last lock software update. It probably lasts 2-3 months on each set of batteries (and these are high-power lithium ones). Oddly, when the batteries begin to fail, it will still lock the door if you do the \"three tap\" gesture, but the bluetooth part stops working so your phone cannot see it. And with this generation changing the batteries requires removing three screws which is oddly annoying.\n\nI keep hoping it'll improve. I love the concept and the engineer in me knows it can work.

I've had the 1st Gen for over a year and it was slow and frustrating to use. It would almost never work with both app and fob. This 2nd Gen, however, works almost instantaneously and reliably almost all the time. If it misses the first time you tap (about 15-20% of the time), it'll definitely get it right away on the second tap. Again, I'm using both phone and fob, in my pockets, so your experience may vary. I've not yet had to do 3 or more tries to lock/unlock, which is already the biggest advantage over the 1st Gen because it always needed several tries to respond. Installation is a tad more difficult than a 1st Gen, but that's due to more security implemented into the lock. It's also much more aesthetically pleasing with a sturdier construction than the 1st Gen.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is that Kwikset still needs a better development team for Kevo.\nIFTTT compatibility is a plus, but there is plenty of room for improvement. Remote locking/unlocking is not possible without a $99 add-on (must be purchased directly from Kwikset) is a thumbs down. No proximity lock/unlock is also a downer. I'm also hoping for Google Home support soon, since they've supposedly made it compatible with Alexa months ago.\nSupport for Android Wear is also finicky. Kevo did not initially work with my Moto 360 and took months before Kevo became compatible. Now that Android Wear 2.0 is out for Moto 360, Kevo stopped working with it again. There are also issues with sharing eKeys and assigning available times, which ended up forcing me to factory reset the Kevo lock.\n\nThe 2nd Gen Kevo is a great smart lock, but, again, there's lots of room for improvement... if Kwikset ever improves their Kevo development team. And, if you have issues with the lock responding to the app, make sure to disable battery management for the app. Otherwise, assigning a fob may make the experience better and painless."}

The Kevo consistently drained in 1-2 weeks time. By this time, it was too late to return the product so now I am stuck with an overpriced deadbolt that replaced my just fine deadbolt. I use my keys, I haven't used my Kevo in months.

Horrible software update process...", "Text": "I purchased a 2nd Gen Kevo.\n\nTo start I'm in love with this concept, but it has some specific serious limitations everyone should consider before purchasing.\n\n1) Noisy lock mechanism. Much louder than I thought it would be.\n2) Slow process to lock & unlock. It's not instant like they show in the video. Expect to wait 5 seconds every time you lock or unlock, sometimes much more if it can't find you and you have to try a few times.\n3) The software/firmware update process is totally horrible. Expect it to take 2 HOURS upon initial install. If I have to do this every few months I'm going to want to kill someone. And I had this experience across installing two locks, not just one. So it's not like I got a bad single experience or something. On the first I had to download the update 4 times - each time takes 10 to 20 minutes. Then it installs and goes to \"Verifying Update\". As I'm writing this I'm over an hour just waiting for the verification on the second lock. I'd cancel it because I feel like it must be messed up - but then I'd have to wait for another damn download and I know I'm locked in waiting for another 30 minutes at least without access to my phone. My first lock was the same, it's maddening. My phone battery was at 98% when I started and now it's at 75%. This is no joke, it's maddening.\n4) Kevo Pulse should be included by default, and not an extra $100 charge. I'm already paying $250 for a damn lock they should throw in for free the connectivity that all other smart locks include at no cost.\n\nAnyway, seems cool - if this stupid update would ever effing finish.\n\nUPDATE: I wrote the update above right after buying the locks. I've now had these locks for about two months. They fail ALL THE TIME. What a disappointment. Thank God I have two locks so I'm not constantly locked out of the house. One will fail and I'll be able to go to another door and get in that way. But without a backup way to get into the house, i'd be screwed. They just go offline for no reason at all.\n\nI have a process I do about once every 1 or 2 weeks. I have to take the cover off the lock, pull the batteries out, wait for 10 seconds, then put the batteries back. After that, it will work fine again, but without having done that process it will NEVER WORK AGAIN. I tried waiting for days to see if it would fix itself, it doesn't. I tried other phones to see if it was a problem with my phone, in particular, it wasn't.\n\nMy wife did not approve when I bought these locks. She expected they would fail and leave her in trouble without a key. It's unfortunate but she was right. These locks just are not ready for regular use. Only buy these with the expectation they will fail on a regular basis. Typically once a month or more."}

See update review at bottom.", "Text": "Update: 10-16-2017. I've used this device for about 3 months. I've lowered my rating by a star because the unit does not work reliably. I'd say it works about two-thirds of the time. The problem is that often the door won't lock or unlock using bluetooth, which is pretty much the reason you'd want to buy this lock. As a result, you need to be sure to have a key with you when the bluetooth doesn't work. Also, the app will show a locked device as being open, and vice versa. This makes it next to useless for checking remotely to be sure you locked the deadbolt.\n\nWould I buy it again? Yes, for my particular need (see the full review), but it's an expensive device that all too often fails to live up to one of its most important features: hands free ability to lock or unlock the deadbolt.\n\nOriginal Review: I'd rate the device, the app, and the Alexa \"skill\" to access the device through Alexa commands 5 stars.\n\nThe reason for the four star rating is that it's rather complicated to set up. I had to call Kwikset support and hold for 30 minutes prior to being walked through the process of resetting the Kevo Plus device and re-booting my cable modem and router. The instructions for paring the lock and Kevo Plus were confusing, although via trial and error over about a three hour period, I was able to figure it out. However, I wouldn't wish the process on someone who isn't handy.\n\nOnce everything was installed, the system meets, if not exceeds, my expectations and solves a specific need (see below).\n\nOne warning: you have to pay an extra $99 (plus shipping and taxes) for the Kevo Plus device, which wasn't available from Amazon and took a week to deliver (I bought it directly from Kwikset). This device is required if you wish to control the Kevo deadbolt using Alexa or over the internet. Keep in mind that the Kevo lock uses Bluetooth to communicate with a smart phone. Alexa, on the other hand, communicates via WiFi. To enable the two devices can talk to each other, you need the Kevo Plus, which plugs into a router and then communicates through your WiFi or Internet to the Kevo lock via Bluetooth. (If your eyes are glazing over, just know that it works!)\n\nHere's the specific need that the Kevo system helped solve: We recently installed an exterior residential elevator (our main living level is on the second floor). In addition to the Kevo deadbolt, Kevo Plus device and Amazon's Alexa enabled devices, we purchased a \"Ring\" video door-bell, with two-way communication capabilities.\n\nThe whole package works as follows. A guest comes to the elevator's entrance, which is an exterior door with the Kevo deadbolt. She rings the doorbell. We see her on our smartphone, using the Ring app. She can talk to us and we to her. We also see her displayed on the smartphone via the Ring video feature. We then can either unlock Kevo on its app, or, even easier, we simply say, \"Alexa, ask Kevo to unlock elevator (our name for the Kevo lock).\" Alexa asks us for the pin we've provided to unlock the deadbolt (as an extra security precaution) and we ask our guest to enter the elevator and select the 2nd floor. She then rides up the elevator and we greet her as she enters our living room.\n\nWe can also instruct Alexa to ask Kevo the status of elevator (is the door locked or unlocked) or lock it. I haven't yet used the features which work through Kevo Plus to allow remote access (temporary or otherwise) to others (such as service personnel) through the app or by logging into the Kevo account on a computer. But I understand how to use these features and expect that they would work perfectly."}

Does this seem like a whole lot of money to spend, considering the entry price is about $200, to just have to use your key, that you already had working on an existing lock? Now that I've got it installed and sort of working, to me the reviewer, the answer is not really.\n\nI started by unpacking the Kevo and going over the items and downloading the app to my iPhone 6+. The app has a good step by step instructional video/animation to do the install. I started by removing my existing deadbolt lock. I originally installed and since repaired that lock so I wasn't worried about having issues installing this. I did the measurements as instructed and found my door was close but not exactly the measurements listed. I proceeded anyway figuring I was close enough that given the Schlage I removed was a standard off the shelf lock there shouldn't be a problem. My only concern was the original lock has squared off plates and the Quickset has curved. If it was the other way I'd have needed a chisel. The curves fit in the square but I\u2019ll look into an adapter later. I proceeded with the assembly of the parts onto the door. Everything seemed to fit well regardless of my measurements being slightly off. As I proceeded to the point of screwing things together I had good tightness and alignment. It was now time to install the battery pack and set the system to my door. The instructions and animation show the deadbolt retracting fully then extending fully if I follow the instructions. Well, here was my first panic. My lock was only partially retracting but did return to full extension. If I told it I had a problem I was instructed to try again then call for help. I'm doing this on Sunday and support is Monday to Saturday. So, having no help I just pressed on to see if it would work when fully assembled.\n\nIt became time to pair my phone with the lock, which then initiated a firmware update to the lock. I've never had to firmware update my front door before, welcome to the 21st century. After the update I finished putting on the backing and set about to testing it. Well, now that it was all assembled it opened and closed the lock as it should. It fully extended and retracted the dead bolt. I took a deep breath and continued setting up my software side for use.\n\nIt was now when I learned after sending my roommate an eKey that his Android phone wasn't on the compatibility list. It is a Motorola Android phone on 5.0 but not blessed with compatibility. So, he's going to have to use a key or carry the fob ($25) to get in and out. If you need more than the two eKeys included in the kit, they are $2 each. As I continued to explore my options I learned about the Kevo Plus upgrade. The sales pitch in the app mentions there are no fees or subscription but never mentions a price. I had to start the order process and fill in all my information to get to the shipping page where I can choose from all my shipping choices. Yup, all my choices was UPS Ground at ten bucks and the device was $100. So $110, maybe tax, I took it no further to get the dongle that talks to your router and lets you access the Kevo from anywhere. That's more than half again the price of the lock for what looks like a little plastic dongle. From the picture I can't tell if you plug it in to an A/C socket or hang it from the router with an Ethernet cable. I'm assuming you need to plug it in as the lock is Bluetooth and the dongle is going to have to be near it to function and the dongle will wifi to the router. I'm guessing on this but feel confident that's how it would work. Maybe someone will splurge on this and add to a review. Amazon doesn't sell this kit as of yet. Seems mighty high to me and I'll be holding off.\n\nSo, I have it all working and I am trying to test use and stress it. With my iPhone in my pocket I stood outside my door, key also in my pocket and roommate inside, I'm not crazy. I started opening and closing the door lock, by touching the bezel of the lock. The outer lock flashes blue, green and red depending what it's doing. My iPhone buzzed with notifications when it was successful. There numerous times I got a flashing light and no action. I always let it settle between attempts. It was discouraging the amount of times it didn't work. This is only my first day and I had failure. It always seemed to respond correctly on the next attempt but I had reliable failure with this test. The key always worked as it is fully mechanical. So I'll always be carrying the key as when the batteries fail you're going to need it. Based on what I learned in the app a low battery warning is part of the system. That said, what if you're on a long trip and the battery may warn you but you're not near it and return home to a dead battery. You'll need the key. As for that key, my roommate used to manufacture and sell high security locks. He looked at the key a saw no special high security cutting, a regular key. So all the high tech with a lock that can be picked by a twelve year old girl (check the YouTubes\u2026). The literature says its bump proof or resistant but I want to see that girl on the Internet have at this. I'm not convinced. Why all the electronics if your just using a simple key? Yes also, this has the easy key changing system to rekeying the tumbler.\n\nIf I learn something new later I'll update this but as of now I'm not thrilled and especially not thrilled with the money pit this device starts. I think unlimited eKeys should just be there, 24 hour eKeys are free, and 50% the price of the device again for a remote dongle that should just be in the box seems outrageous to me. Support for more phones is a must and for a version 2, not having them, preposterous. I'm also disheartened that the not inexpensive price of the lock is just a starting point. This is my first smart lock and I don't know what the competition offers for price and features but I'm only mildly impressed and mostly concerned. Maybe version 3 will be even better?\n\nUpdate: June 16, 2017\n\nWe've had firmware and software updates and it's really not working well at all. I like it when it works but every exit and entrance is a game of \u201copen the pod bay doors, Kevo\u201d. It usually doesn't, that's the bottom line. This week I had my scariest problem. Until now I haven't been locked out. I left my apartment and amazingly the Kevo locked my door on the first tap. That was great and I went along. It wasn't until later when I needed my iPhone that I realized I had left without it. I had the holster on my belt but neglected to take it. WAIT!!! How did the Kevo lock my door? I don't have a fob on my keychain and no phone. How the heck did it lock? It did. I went home to retrieve my iPhone and found it in the living room next to my recliner. The\nThat is about 20\u2019 away from and 10\u2019 in from by front door. Definitely inside the house and should not be confused with being outside the door. This now means an accidental brush of the lock when throwing out garbage could wind up locking me out. I don't usually carry my keys to toss out the garbage. The chute is right across from my door. I'm looking into replacing this as it's a total fail now.\n\nAny ideas Kwikset? I haven't called support yet as this is a Vine review and not sure if I have true support."}

I wanted to like this product, I really did... Prior to this I had a door lock with a number keypad, which I was able to unlock with the number code or unlock from my phone (whether I was local or not).\n\nI specifically got this product because it \"works with nest\". I obviously didn't read it clearly enough, I thought I'd be able to unlock and lock it from my nest app... (however, I need to pay another 99.00 plus shipping to unlock remotely). OK, that part is my fault for not properly researching... no stars taken away there.\n\nHowever... that said... this bolt is very unreliable. I ALWAYS have to have my keys with me. It does work upon touch... eventually. I have to stand and wait for a while while the light spins... and spins... and spins. I DO have the app open on my phone and bluethooth turned on... but still no avail. Most times it will eventually open, however, occasionally I have to dig out my keys.\n\nIt DOES work quickly when I brush the lock on accident though (grrrr). On occasion, I will touch the lock while closing my door and the bolt engages before I get the door shut. I have to reach around, unlock it, then shut the door, then tap it to lock again.\n\nWhether it's my lack of research or not, I also am not a fan of having to pay an extra 100+ dollars to be able to remotely lock and unlock my door. I was able to do that with my old lock and it was very handy for letting in the pest control guy (for example). He'd call when he got there and I'd remotely unlock the door. I cannot do that now. So I either need to be there, give him a key or just not have him come at all. I don't have time to take off of work.\n\nLastly, I don't feel it's very secure. If I happen to be near my front door with my phone on... ANYONE can tap my lock from outside and unlock my front door. I used to leave my phone and keys by my front door so I wouldn't forget them and now I can't do that because it makes my home insecure.\n\nIt's not broken (I don't think... maybe the slow response is a fault with the product) so I can't really return it. I tried it for 3 months and have since lost the box and receipt anyway. So I'm stuck with it - or I have to just waste the few hundred I spent on it and throw it away... I'm just not really happy with it. It's pretty looking though."}

Something didn't look right and it wasn't. The deadbolt assembly has a triangular shape and the interior locking knob was missing the insert. I spoke to the people at Kwikset and they got a replacement out in record time. Once the lock was completely installed, it worked as promised.\n\nThe construction is on par with most locks I have seen - it certainly was no less durable than the keyed deadbolt I replaced. the ring lets you know the status - the blue led spins the circuit and turns amber when it locks, green when it unlocks. One beep, locking, two beeps, locking. There are other status colors that Kevo covers through their app and support site. You also have the option of using a key - and I recommend this highly - while I am a huge fan of technology, I believe in redundancy.\n\nThe bluetooth can be a little finicky - sometimes I have to take the phone out of my holster and bring it closer. Our neighbor watches our pups while we are at work and she loves her kevo fob - this is a great accessory for someone who isn't interested in installing the app.\n\nAnd the app IS useful, folks. You can give privileges, revoke privileges, and monitor who is accessing the lock. This is a pretty powerful tool and one the be best things about a smart lock. I got the kevo plus at the same time as the lock but I believe the bluetooth only interface also lets you know when someone is locking or unlocking your door - and who.\n\nI finally got around to linking my Kevo with Alexa. You can ask your unit to check the status of your lock or locks and instruct it to lock your doors - you cannot unlock it without reciting a pin code. I am not sure if this is something you should use save as a last resort - while it is unlikely someone outside your home would be able to learn your code and have Alexa recognize it, it is something to be mindful of.\n\nSo $250 for the lock and a fob. Another $100 for the Kevo plus unit - which I do recommend. That's a lot of money for a smart lock. I do like knowing who is accessing my door and when it is accessed. I like being able to check on the lock. Combined with our KUNA smart lamp, this is a great home security tool.\n\nI would like it a hell of a lot more if the package cost me about $100 - 150 less though."}

{"Author": "D. Matheny", "Date": "on May 8, 2017", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Be sure to get a Gen 2! Compatibility and performance are excellent.", "Text": "I've been playing around/trying different smart locks over the last couple of years, and hadn't really found anything that worked better than a standard keypad - until now.\n\nA couple of months ago, I replaced the keypad lock coming in from our garage with one of these. Shortly after, I put one on my workshop out back - and the results have been so positive that we now have them on all our exterior doors.\n\nBefore going into details, I need to specify that you should definitely make sure you get the Gen 2 version of this lock. After trying the Gen 1 previously, I suspect most of the bad reviews here may be mistakenly referencing the previous version.\n\n[*** Installation ***]\n\nIf you've ever installed a lock, you already know how easy it is to do. Having said that, on the first one I got I just started slapping it together and realized half way through that I should have read the instructions first. (Who knew?)\n\nThere's an awesome interactive guide available if you install the mobile app which makes the process extremely simple.\n\nEven though installing the lock itself is easy, the firmware update takes forever - and you need to keep your phone in close proximity during the update process. Be sure to allocate at least 20 minutes for that update.\n\n[*** Compatibility ***]\n\nWe have 4 people in our family, 2 using Android and 2 using iPhones.\n\nThis lock works perfectly with all of them - just remember that you have to keep your Bluetooth enabled for it to work. I will say it seems to pick up a few seconds quicker on the Android phones, but that's just an observation and I didn't try to measure the difference.\n\nOn top of Android and iPhone compatibility, it also works great with Android Wear. It's pretty cool to be able to lock/unlock the door from my wrist. :)\n\nPersonally, I'm using a Casio Men's WSD-F20 Watch which supports Bluetooth.\n\n[*** Functionality ***]\n\nThe mobile app is pretty basic, but does everything it needs to do pretty simply.\n\nI was able to create & share keys with my family, and can easily specify schedules, expiration dates or administrators.\n\nOn top of that, I got the Kevo Plus upgrade and can control/view any of the locks remotely.\n\nThere is another issue the Kevo Plus solves: Without the Plus upgrade, I was able to share keys with people but the key never seemed to work until after the person had accepted the key AND I had gone back and connected to the lock at least once. That kind of makes sense because the lock doesn't stay connected to the Internet and only connects via Bluetooth.\n\n[*** Performance ***]\n\nI'd say the lock opens immediately on the first touch about 80% of the time for all connected users.\n\nThe remaining 20% of the time the lock requires 2 touches - which means you will be waiting for it to open for 20-30 seconds in those situations. Personally, that isn't a big deal for me at all, but I can see how it would be irritating if you aren't expecting it.\n\nThere are some situations that impact performance:\n1) Leaving & locking up tends to require 2 touches more often than arriving. I suspect this is due to the feature that detects which side of the lock your phone is on.\n2) When multiple family members are together with their phones, it can take a bit longer. Once again, my theory here is it doesn't know immediately which phone to connect to.\n\nWe had one that was defective (the lights didn't light up reliably, and it didn't lock/unlock all the time). Fortunately, Amazon replaced it immediately with a new one and we haven't had any additional problems.\n\n[*** Keys ***]\n\nI had never used the Kwikset re-key feature, but it's pretty cool - and very easy to use.\n\nIt takes just a few seconds to re-key a lock, so now all our exterior locks match. :)\n\nSince each of these comes with 2 keys, I purchased a Kwikset SmartKey Re-keying Kit which comes with 4 matching keys and an upgraded re-key tool.\n\n[*** Remote Access ***]\n\nAs I already mentioned, we're using the Kevo Plus service for remote access.\n\nThe coolest thing about that is only one Kevo Plus device was enough to power the entire house. As a quick reference, we have a 3,000 sq ft - 2 story home. A centrally placed Kevo Plus can easily access our 3 exterior doors.\n\nIn addition, we have an outdoor workshop about 20 yards outside the back door - and the Kevo Plus reaches that perfectly as well.\n\nI expected to need at least 2 Kevo Plus devices and was excited to only need one.\n\n[*** Looks ***]\n\nThis is subjective, but we love the look of these. The lighting ring is great for providing status - but it also adds a 'tech' feel to a traditional-looking lock.\n\n[*** Battery Life ***]\n\nI know it's only been a couple of months, and I'd be disappointed if the batteries were already dead.\n\nWhen the original batteries die I'll post here to give an idea of how long they last.\n\n==> Update 6/20/2017 <==\n\nI just changed the batteries for the first time in the workshop lock last night after getting an alert that the batteries were low.\n\nInterestingly enough, it wasn't the first one I installed - and it isn't the one that's used the most either; so hopefully the other locks get quite a bit more than a 4-month run-time. I'll post again when the batteries start failing on the remaining locks just to see if the short life on this one was a fluke.\n\n[*** Conclusion ***]\n\nOverall, these locks were exactly what I was looking for. They're reliable, look great, and are easy to manage.\n\nI would highly recommend giving these a try!"}

{"Author": "Yeah, well my review is the only one that matters! So there! :P", "Date": "on May 1, 2017", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Kevo lock chews through 4 AA batteries at a time, has design flaws making battery replacement a pain, and poor customer service.", "Text": "#1 BATTERY USAGE: This lock goes through AA batteries way too fast. I use very good quality name brand batteries but this lock uses them up quickly because it is battery operated for everything it does. The lock mechanism for opening and closing uses battery power and it's on standby mode all day and night just waiting to detect someone touching the lock which uses up the battery.\n#2 BATTERY COMPARTMENT ACCESS: It wouldn't be that bad (just the cost of the batteries every so often) but Kwikset designed this lock in such a stupid way that to replace the batteries you can't just pop off the cover and switch them out. You have to go get a screw driver and unscrew these 3 teeny tiny itty bittty little screws on both sides and 1 on the bottom. The screw on the bottom is directly over the door handle so it's tough to get the screwdriver in it and you must angle the screwdriver. Over time unscrewing the bottom screw with the bit head angled the way it has to be will strip the screw head rounding it out to the point it won't even catch anymore. These screws are very small an easily lost so if you have carpet below your door be careful not to drop a screw and if you have wood floor, as I do, or tile be prepared for a hunt as well because they do bounce far.\n#3 FALSE TOUCH LOCKING: I've been inside feet away from the door with the door wide open and no one has been near the door in at least 5 minutes and all of a sudden it will activate and lock. I don't have it set to auto lock after 30 seconds or anything like that and there was no one around to brush by it let alone touch it. It happens fairly often but fortunately I've only noticed it locking but that may be just because if the door is open the lock is in the unlocked position so it only has the option of locking.\n#4 I'm not sure but I think the Kevo App is also using my phone battery because I've noticed my Galaxy S7 doesn't make it 3/4 of the day anymore and it started right when I got this lock.\n#5 Any time my phone dies and I have to charge it up and power it back on or if I reset my phone or turn it off then on I have to remember to go back into the Kevo app otherwise it won't work with the lock. The app must always be running for it to work with the lock.\n#6 I called customer service at 1343 hours and they said they are experiencing a high volume of calls (THERE ARE LOTS OF UNHAPPY KEVO CUSTOMERS!) and they gave me the option to leave a call back number and they would keep my place in line and call me back once my number came up... well I left my number and now it's 1453 hours and I still haven't heard from customer service so that's over a 70 minute wait which as far as customer service goes I would say that's pretty crappy.\nOverall crappy design flaws, crappy power consumption, and crappy customer service... all for the price of about $230+tax so $250?"}

Living in the city with dogs means I go in and out of the front door multiple times per day every day. Big picture this lock is an improvement over physical keys, but just barely. If the performance or reliability were even slightly worse I'd take it off and send it back.\n\nKwikset's support division for this product is absolutely comically atrocious.

However this weekend while washing the car out front, my young daughter, who I didn't give an ekey, runs up and tells me that she was able to unlock and lock the front door by touching it. I check the history and found that it used a key on a phone charging upstairs and another on a phone about 50 feet behind the front door.\n\nFor $200+ I expect much more peace of mind. Cool concept, but I am not convinced that Bluetooth is the right medium - too much variability in RF and not exactly near field when you consider BT signals reach pretty much anywhere in most American households.\n\nWe got the smart lock bug but we're sticking with a traditional deadbolt until this technology shakes out."}

When we first installed it, we were thrilled with the way it worked, especially being able to unlock our front door by just touching the lock, as long as we had an iphone in our pockets. Unfortunately, however, recent updates to the Apple IOS system have totally destroyed the locks functionality,. Even though Kevo claims there is an update to the firmware that will solve the problem, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO INSTALL THE UPDATE. I have tried dozens of times, but each time the update fails a few percentage points in. To make things worse, Kevo's product support is totally unacceptable. You can never get through on phone support, and even though they claim they will call you back, that never happens.\n\nUnless and until Kevo fixes both their software and their support system, I'd stay far away from this Smart Lock."}

They come from one company, so it's easier.\n\nAnyhow, Kwikset finally pushed the app out to other Android handsets aside from the Google and Samsung phones, so I finally bit the bullet and bought one. So here's my summary:\n\nInstallation of hardware: easy peasey. I've changed a few doorknobs and locks, so this was pretty straightforward. The install instructions in the app are also accurate and easy to follow. Rekeying the lock was VERY simple. Calibration of the lock was automatic and fast.\n\nPairing: pretty simple. Paired quickly, then proceeded to update the lock's firmware via Bluetooth (that took a while).\n\nUsage: Sometimes the Bluetooth connection takes a bit longer than I'd like, but still faster than pulling out my keys and unlocking it manually. It connects in the time it takes me to walk from my car to the door, so no problems unlocking. When leaving, it takes a few seconds of standing there outside the door before it connects. All in all, function is quite good. Accessing the lock from the app seems to take a while, but I don't actually touch the app often.\n\nAppearance: Very nice. The electronics are much smaller than the first gen, which were similar in size/shape to the 910/911 models for ZigBee/zwave. Wish it came in more finishes, but the Venetian bronze is quite nice.\n\nE-keys: this is the only part that's a bit clumsy. Once someone has an e-key it works great, buuuut... The ekey invite links to the iOS app only, and the process for accepting an ekey is rather cumbersome. I had to walk each recipient through the process. This is the only thing I marked down for.\n\nAll in all: quite a good piece of hardware, and the app is quite solid. Most importantly, it's very good at working and doing its thing without me having to take my phone out. The primary downfall of most \"connected home\" applications is the fact that you wind up using your phone as a remote control. This doesn't. Good job (finally) Kwikset!"}

The software often has trouble with iOS updates and for quite some time the lock would only sense my phone if the app was open and visible on my phone. The last two days, upon coming home late at night, the blue lights have just started spinning eternally and I could not open the lock at all and had to find an unlocked window or other way into the house. Only pulling the batteries would reset the spinning lights. And speaking of batteries, it eats batteries like crazy and is so poorly designed that the only way to replace the batteries is to unscrew the entire cover (multiple screws) as the battery pack cannot be accessed simply by removing the pop-off back cover. In short, coming home is always a trial now and this poorly conceived lock is not the convenience it claims to be. I'd rather use good old-fashioned keys.

It is quite disingenuous to call it a BlueTooth device. I feel that 90% of all the problems that I've read online about it are a result of this one fact. Although it technically uses the bluetooth frequency and hardware, it does not comply with bluetooth protocols and does not work as a traditional bluetooth device. For instance, you cannot \"pair\" it the way you would a headset, a keyboard, or a speaker device - pairing throws a bunch of errors and causes your smartphone to get very confused; locked up even! The way it works is through this proprietary app (which at first looked scam-ish to me because it did not clearly state that it was the official Kwikset app for the device). The app pairs with the lock using your bluetooth hardware, but uses it in a non-standard way that is full of problems. The short of the long is that on my Samsung S6 with the latest stable android build, it would take me multiple attempts and up to 5 minutes to lock or unlock my door. The \"scanning for lock\" would time out, lock/unlock could not complete. The initial software update that it performed via this highjacked bluetooth interface took a solid 20 minutes to upload a tiny firmware file. Something is VERY wrong there!\n\nThere are some other concerns as well:\n1. The software absolutely requires for your phone to have it's GPS location to be on in order to work with the lock. That is extremely creepy because that means that some datacenter not only has the information to open my lock, but also knows where that lock is. I tried a few things to trick the software into working without GPS, but it is just hard-coded not to and they are serious about it!\n\n2. The installation instructions for the lock failed to mention that you have to perform \"The Door Handling Procedure\" for the gearing mechanism to align itself with the direction of your deadbolt. The lock just makes god-awful clicking sounds and is hard to turn until you successfully complete this. Every other electronic lock that I've worked with, usually has a toggle switch that does this, but the Kevo has a poorly made automated procedure that does this. I eventually found the instructions online, but they were not part of the video guide that I played to install the thing!\n\n3. They talk a lot about the awesome security log that is built into the system, but they missed that mark by a mile! The lock itself doesn't actually log anything! The only log is kept in your app, so there is no way for your app to know if someone else's phone opened your lock, or if someone used a key, or if your lock was opened via the latch. All things that could have been easily coded into the lock and would make it an awesome security device with alerts and stuff like that. But no, the in-app log is garbage! It logs lock/unlock events even when they fail, which is why I read so many posts from people saying that they were confused when they found their doors open and the app saying that it was locked.\n\n4. The fit and assembly left much to be desired. The blue lug on my lock did not seem to sit deeply enough (although it was clicked in and secure) and prevented the metal sandwich from coming together well. I took it apart a dozen times trying to figure it out and finally decided that it's made that way. As a result the screws and the holes don't align well and the mechanism is not super-flush against the door. It's not an eyesore, but it could have been made better.\n\nIn troubleshooting my connection issues, I read a lot of posts from people complaining that their lock worked perfectly until a software update to the app, or to their phone OS, or until they changed their phone. Given the unholy proprietary way that they are using bluetooth and GPS hardware to make the link, I am not at all surprised and would say that you absolutely should not buy this if you plan to use it via Bluetooth with the eKeys.\n\nThe silver lining:\nKevo does have this thing called the Kevo Plus, which as of this writing can be only bought from their website and costs $100+shipping. What this thing effectively does is bridge the Bluetooth network to your wired ethernet network and allows you to open your lock from anywhere via the internet. It says that it's wifi but it actually requires to stay connected to your wired network. At least the instructions (which have you connect it via wire for the initial config) never tell you to disconnect, nor was there any place to enter my SSID or WiFi password. The 'wireless' part is the bluetooth side of the bridge that talks to your lock without wires.\n\nWhat is however very cool is that the Plus uses the same hacked-up flavor of bluetooth to talk to the lock and appears to have zero issues doing so! They are like furbies - they speak a language nobody can make scene of, but they do understand each other and that is what makes this actually work! The box then translates furby speak into standard IP, which you can reach through the web without issue.\n\nOnce you finish the setup of the Plus box, you marry it to your phone's app and then the connection goes from your phone, via the internet, hits the Plus box, which then opens your lock. I've tested it a bunch and it works great and very quickly each and every time!\n\nAs an IT guy however I again have some security concerns with this. The only way that the app on my phone could find the Plus box via the internet is if it always knew your home network's public IP and for most people (myself included) that IP changes regularly. That means that the Plus box has some sort of a built-in DDNS system that the app can check in order to make the connection. That means that Kwikset is maintaining a database some place of IPs and locks they go to. Naturally, this can be broken into and probably used to unlock your door. If nothing else, it gives Kwikset a way to 'obsolete' your lock whenever they stop supporting this database, or for your lock to become useless if they go out of business. I would have much preferred the ability to set my own DDNS services and configure the app the access the address of my choosing without the involvement of a 3rd party.\n\nThat said, I've been using the Kevo lock with the Plus box all day today, and it worked well. Without the box, the thing would have been on a truck going back to Amazon by now."}

You install a free app on your phone, which walks you through the installation process. This is pretty straightforward. Once installed, you connect to it via Bluetooth and can then lock and unlock the deadbolt from your phone. You can share it with other people in your family so they can use it, and you can create temporary guest keys as well. This is very well designed and works very well. It has a slight lag when the app is loading and connecting, but if you do that while walking up to the door, it shouldn't slow you down any. Of course there are keys you can use if you don't have your phone or the batteries die. This is the annoying part...you do have to disassemble it a bit to replace the batteries (which are included) but that shouldn't be very often.\n\nThe one thing I dislike is that the door automatically re-locks every time. That means if you want to go in and out several times, you have to unlock it every time. I haven't found a way to disable this yet. It's certainly nice for when you leave for the day, but you can always lock it from your phone after you leave. And opening a specific app is a bit tedious as well. It would be nice if it worked like some car locks, where it senses you near it and automatically unlocks."}

Only 4 eKeys available unless purchased. Access to unlimited eKeys is provided with a gateway purchase.\nNotes: I like the idea of the Kevo. I had high hopes after installation that it would be everything I had hoped it would be.\n\nGateway - provides access to your lock from the internet.\nPros: Again, relatively easy setup, small device easy to hide. Access to door control, the ability to check lock status, and ability to view access logs is great. Response to a lock or unlock request is fulfilled within 5-10 seconds over the internet. With the gateway you receive unlimited eKeys.\nCons: appears to not work unless connected directly to your internet router - communication protocol appears not to be routable through switches that you may be using to extend your network.\nNotes: The gateway is an additional purchase - an extra hundred bucks on top of a relatively expensive investment. I attempted for two hours to configure the device attached to a network drop close to the door. All attempts failed. After another hour of reconfiguring my network wiring I was able to connect it directly to the router with immediate success. Nowhere in the literature did I find anything that would have led me to believe I absolutely had to connect to the router itself rather than just any ethernet port on my home network. This would have swayed me away from the purchase of the gateway because I believed my router was too far from the door to be effective, and the thought of reconfiguring the wiring was not attractive.\n\nKiwkset Kevo Key Fob Accessory\nPro: it works\nCon: It is not configurable through the app.\nNotes: The fob is essentially an electronic pass key. If you have it in your pocket and touch the lock, it opens. This is where my disappointment sets in. It is not immediately clear from promotional materials that a fob cannot be controlled much the same as eKeys from the standpoint of programmed access control. They do not show up in the app. You cannot enable or disable a fob on demand. You cannot schedule access times. If a fob is lost or stolen you must reset the entire system and reassign all eKeys to all users.\n\nFinal comments:\nThe prescribed procedure for dealing with a lost or stolen Fob is not an acceptable solution in my mind. It was my expectation that I would be able to give a fob to my house cleaning lady (she doesn't have a smart phone) and I would be able to limit access to a prescribed window of time and maintain my privacy and security at all other times. This is not possible with the Fob.\n\nThe access control features available for eKeys is somewhat better, though it is not possible, for instance, to allow the pool guy access every other Tuesday - your only option is to allow access every Tuesday, or manually turn access on or off. This kind of defeats the whole purpose that triggered this rather substantial investment in the first place.\n\nPerhaps this is a case of jumping on the technology too soon? I'm afraid when the features I need become available I will need to rip out and replace the entire system. That's how a five star product becomes a two star review, sad to say."}

It will randomly lock when you walk outside without your phone or fob but then it won't unlock. The movement of air moving past it seems to be enough to set it off, the unit does not need to be touched -unless you are actually trying to lock it and half the time it won't lock. It will also lock sometimes when you have the door open, which has resulted in our door trim being beat to hell from the extended bolt. Again, no phone or fob is needed for this action to take place. I hate it with every fiber of my being, and consider taking a hammer to it DAILY. We've ran every update and the issue persists.

The obvious disadvantage is that it will not work if you do not have your phone. I have a combo lock on my garage door, and I moved the old lock to my interior garage door into the house to fix this. It is supposed to work with my smart watch, but I have not been able to get it to work yet. When I bought this, it was only advertised to work with my iphone. The irony is it now works much better with my android. I have an iphone 6s for personal use and an s7 edge for work. The iphone requires the app to be open (in the background is fine). The android version allows a service to run in the background with the app closed. When I have my android phone, kevo works every time, the first time, perfectly. With my iphone I sometimes have to press it multiple times, and it often takes a while to work. My wife's iphone has the same issues and my father in law's android works just as well as mine. My biggest complaint is the battery use. When the run in background service is turned on (in settings on android) it drains the battery at 2x the speed or more. This happens on the iphone when the app is running as well. Because of this, I end up shutting the app off when I am not at home. This reduces the convenience of the app a lot. My wife has been asking me to return to the combo keypad lock since we installed it. The biggest reason I haven't yet is because it looks better and it is on my front door. Another complaint I have is that when I remove the battery cover to replace the batteries, it scratches the door.\n\nAll in all, if you use android, and you use and charge your phone a lot, this is a fantastic product. If you are like me, and you go a long time between charges on your phone, you are better off with a keypad style lock."}

Very good with technology and very disappointed with this locks performance. First, we installed the K\u0113vo smart lock because it seemed like the perfect solution, no app to open. As long as the app is running and your phone is on you, it should work.\n\nReality is different. The lock is constantly saying it is jammed, even though it locked the door just fine. It makes a really loud beeeeeeeep and flashes red. We just let it go because I know it's locked. I believe this is because our door is new, with high quality weatherstripping and it seals nice and tight. I installed the lock so that the door handle latches a smidge tighter than the lock. I knew the lock being powered would not be able to push the door a little and lock the deadbolt. The deadbolt glides locked pretty easily and only started saying jammed about a month after install.\n\nAnother huge is how dumb this thing is for a smart lock. Don't lock yourself out like I have. Ever go to take out the trash with your phone and your keys inside your house? I mean you are just walking to the trash can outside and back. Not with this lock. A few times now I've accidentally hit the deadbolt on the way out. Well since its touch to activate I close the door and it deadbolts. Then I'm stuck in the garage, no phone or keys. My phone is inside when this happens. Thankfully someone else was home the 3x this has happened, otherwise I would be invigorate trouble.\n\nThe device is just more trouble than its worth."}

I did buy the antenna (Kevo plus) which helped a lot with boosting the connection. I travel a lot and it's great for giving access without handing out keys. I also found that roommates were moving the latch after Kevo \"closed\" (they didn't think it closed completely). This screwed up the calibration after awhile. The lock WAS locked completely, but the inside knob has play. Just ignore the temptation! Once I reset the lock it went back to smooth moves. Overall I'm happy- all bluetooth has a bit of lag due to connecting. The trade off is no more lost keys!"}

Door motor is poor. It's loud and slow and the small amount of friction in my old front door causes it to jam. It has not successfully unlocked yet, although I have gotten it to lock via Bluetooth several times.\n\nBluetooth would be my second gripe. It you're close enough to connect via Bluetooth it is faster, quieter, and more reliable to take the three steps and operate the lock by hand.\n\nTouching the bezel doesn't seem to work unless I've connected via Bluetooth, so see above issue. And if I've got the phone out and the app open to connect why not unlock from the app instead of putting the phone away to touch the lock?\n\nI have had it connect about the same time i got the door unlocked with my key, only to brush the lock and have it try to relock the door.\n\nI don't go out the front door unless I have my keys or the back door is unlocked for fear of it going Hal 9000 on me and locking me out.\n\nThe ekeys have been a fail so far too. They require the other person to install an app, install the ekey in the app, sync their phone to the lock, and then hope the lock doesn't jam. Both times I've tried this I've gotten home and unlocked the door with my key before any ekeys were successfully used.\n\nOh and connection wise it does not sync with Alexa, Samsung smartthings, or anything else it seems. I knew this going in but I didn't realize how bad the Bluetooth would be. I've decided to double down and pay the $120 for the kevo plus to see if it improves the situation drastically. I'm also going to grease the bolt. If that doesn't help its going into the trash.\n\nThe kevo plus works as advertised for locking and unlocking remotely. The bolt seems to be working fairly well. I only come in and out of this door once a day, so it gets 2 uses a day. It's asking for another set of batteries which I don't understand, I've only had it installed since December and this is the third set. Kwikset says 10 uses a day for 12 months. I'm at 2 a day for 2 months. The kevo app has to be running on your phone and the phone has to be on you or the lock will not operate by touch. I have use the remote unlock once because it was faster than having relatives download the app, register it, get the ekey, etc. There really isn't much other functionality to it. Definitely not worth the extra money and the hassle.\n\nI gave up replacing batteries for 2 months and have been using my $200 dead bolt as a $20 dead bolt. I replaced them last Monday finally. 6 days later I'm getting a low battery alert every time i go through the door. 6 months in... its down to one star"}

{"Author": "SierraQ", "Date": "on December 9, 2016", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great lock but could be just a little better", "Text": "First, be advised that if you lock is not behaving as expected you may have a defective unit. I've read enough negative reviews that line up with my FIRST lock that I wonder if there are some quality control issue when making these.\n\nMy FIRST lock worked initially but then quickly developed some irritating behaviors including: not recognizing my touch (it took 3-10 tries to get in most of the time), not recognized by my phone, displaying false jamb (red light) notifications, displaying yellow lights (indicating lock) but not actually locking. After this got bad enough I decided that this cannot possibly be normal so I called customer service. They walked me through some tests and it quickly started acting up again. So they send me a new lock.\n\nThe SECOND lock is what earns the four stars. It has behaved way better. Gone are all the symptoms except occasionally it does ignore me. MOST of the time it opens on the first try but every once in awhile it takes 2-3 attempt. I find that if I kill and restart the Kevo app it works perfectly afterwards.\n\nAnd that is why I did not give it five stars. 1) the reliability is not perfect. I would like to get in my house the first time, every time. 2) the Kevo app requirements are a bit annoying. They are:\n1) App must be running in background -- I can deal with this\n2) Bluetooth must be enabled -- this is also normal and fine\n3) Location services must be on and Kevo app is ALWAYS used it -- it is this that I object to.\nThey claim location services are used ot detect movement and offer a more reliable experience. I can believe that but this is a misuse of location services. Phone have gyros and fitness chips which are designed to track movement for exercise and these are on all the time by default. So why can't the Kevo app make use of these? The annoyance of location services is not battery usage--I have verified that the battery usage of Kevo on my iPhone 6 is only 1-3% typically. The annoyance is having the location indicator constantly on because I use that to flag apps that truly are sucking down the battery by using it excessively.\n\nTHE GOOD\n- Supposedly this lock fixes the physical security deficiencies of the 1st generation.\n- Has technology to detect if you are inside or out preventing just anyone from opening it.\n- Can open lock without taking phone out\n- Auto-calibrates, unlike gen 1, so installation is fast\n- Three kinds of eKeys are available: anytime, scheduled, and guest (24 hour key). Two anytime eKeys and guest eKeys are free. Permanent or timed keys cost a few bucks via in-app purchase.\n- Can also use app, regular key, or a fob (sold separately) to open the door, this offers nice flexibility\n- You can disable touch-to-open function and just use app if you wish\n- App tells you if it is locked or not--kind of nice if you are in the car or in bed and wonder: did I lock the door? And if you didn't, you can lock it remotely.\n\nTHE BAD\n- Not 100% reliable and not always fast. Sometimes it might take a few tries to open the door. This will of course happen when you are in the rain, cold, and have a screaming toddler in your arms. Generally, however, this has been fairly rare since I got the replacement lock.\n- The interior piece is large and requires about 3.5 inches additional clearance beyond of what a normal deadbolt would occupy in the up direction. It's not an eyesore, looks pretty good in my opinion, but if you have anything above your deadbolt, like a secondary lock, this may not fit.\n- Likewise it is not compatible with those big-handle locksets where the deadbolt is built in (handle and deadbolt are all one piece)\n\nNOTES\n- There is a warning that if you have a room in front of the locked door like a study that juts out past your porch, and your phone is that room, then it might allow the lock to be opened because it thinks you are outside. I tried this and admittedly one time out of about twenty did it open for me. I am not worried about this because the phone is never in that room without me--if you have such a setup just don't leave your phone unattended in such a room at night or place a sufficient metal barrier between it and the door to reduce the chance of the lock seeing your phone.\n- DIP switches inside the control area of the lock allow you to turn on/off certain features like \"sound effects,\" \"lock on triple tap,\" and \"turn off inside LED indicator light\" (the latter blinks occasionally showing you lock status). So read the manual carefully for these features"}

Do they have the same folks that design the lock building the web site? Against my better judgement, I decided to try and make this thing work. So, since I was repeatedly nagged to upgrade it seems like perhaps the only way to get the lock to perform in a reliable fashion. Hopefully the upgrade process is not an indicator -- the \"month\" field does not work. You have to select the County first, but it is displayed last. The State field would not work on my iPad - I just gave up and found a computer where the experience was not much better. After a few attempts I managed to get the page to accept the Month. Then there is shipping. There is only 1 option - why ask which option I want? Further, what are you shipping? That took some time to lookup as well. Why not just say \"Our lock doesn't work via the Internet (and really doesn't work well otherwise) unless you buy our bluetooth gateway router and that is what you are buying. Oh, and we are going to stick it to you on the shipping.\"\n\n3. The lock frequently fails to pair. In 8 days of use, I've had to pair it 3 times. A popup every 8-10 seconds prevents me from reasonably discovering the problem - I finally just gave up and will wait until the \"upgrade\" arrives. (hopefully will be better than the lock and software). After the first \"lost\" pairing, I put a key in the car. Good move - I need it frequently. I know, Apple and iOS 10 was a problem. As it happened, I had iOS 9x and two devices and iOS 10 on another. Kevo performs equally terrible on all.\n\n4. two eKeys only? where is that on the web site? (hint - it is not)\n\n5. I recently installed 8 Sensi thermostats. Kevo, you might want to call them to learn how the technology should work.

Installation and set up were no problem. I also added Kevo Plus for remote capabilities. The remote capabilities work great. The issue is in using your phone to unlock/lock door in person. Sometimes it works quickly on the first try, other times I have to keep poking at it as I watch the blue ring light up and then disappear. Sometimes closing the MyKevo app and reopening does the trick. I've tried hitting the recalibration button, but that doesn't seem to do anything. Overall, very inconsistent experience. It's terrible because I am really rooting for the lock!\n\nI can only give it two stars since its primary function, operating by sensing my phone and unlocking by touch, is very unreliable. For now, I'd recommend having either a Kevo Plus (which works great), another access point into the home, or just go old fashion and carry your key.\n\nWebsites support has a ton of articles, but not many covering inconsistent response. My next step will be to call customer service. I'll update any new information.\n\nUpdate: 8/2/17\n\nThe inconsistencies in this lock were just too much. It worked for me 80% of the time.

I got the Kevo, Kevo Plus and one Fob. The first week everything worked great. When I had to update my iphone software things started to be weird like you couldn\u2019t use the touch to open unless you had the Kevo app running. I thought I could live with that for a little while, until things will be solved software wise. The problem is that things got even worse. The touch to open started to be even less predictable - now there is a 20% chance it will work. Sometimes it works with the app running, sometimes it works even if the app is not running so I started to use the Fob but even the fob has a 50% chance of working. For almost a month now, when I'm in front of the door carrying heavy things, phone in my pocket, Fob on my key chain, the touch to open is working only after the 4th try. For a few days I used the Plus feature, opening the door from the app itself, but it usually takes up to 2 minutes and doesn\u2019t work all the time. At this point I will just use the key. So if you want a really expensive door lock that does exactly what a $20 lock does, go for it and make the purchase. Home automation is great and this had the potential of being a great product, but in today\u2019s world you need a lot of software maintenance and fast response after you release a good product.

There are some things I do not like, and the chief one is the noise. Clearly, I understand why it's needed, but it just seems a sound proof casing or something could be an option. The only other problem is the app does not allow full set up IN IT. And that leads to confusion for people who have no intent to use Kevo themselves. For instance, my gardener; now that it is set up, it's outstanding. But for someone who uses it once or twice a month, having a persistent notification or having to create an account that takes ten minutes to create, is kind of a show stopper. Makes the person receiving the eKey be all \"what the hell am I getting into?\" Ha ha.\n\nOther than those issues, it is fantastic and I highly recommend it.\n\nI must note, I test almost every single Smart Home product out there, and while I \"Love\" most of them, I would not recommend most of them. Good example is Philips Hue. Super rad, but monstrously buggy, expensive and requires tons of work to keep up and running. Please do not take offense to this, but the \"wife\" test, as she calls it herself, is that something should function right if I were gone for two months. Well, Kevo 1st generation and now 2nd generation, does just that. It is a set it and forget it.\n\nI must also mention, I think Kevo Plus is required for perfection.

Everything from garage doors (like Chamberlain WD832KEV 1/2hp MYQ-Enabled Whisper Belt Drive Garage Door Opener) light bulbs (like TP-Link Smart LED Light Bulb, Wi-Fi, Dimmable, A19, Tunable White, 60W Equivalent, Works with Amazon Alexa) to light switches (like Lutron Caseta Wireless In-Wall Dimmer Kit, (Kit Includes Dimmer, Pico Remote and Wall Plate), 600-watt/150-watt, Multi-Location,Works with Amazon Alexa) to cameras (like Ring Video Doorbell Pro) to electronics (like Wink Connected Home Hub) and now to door locks with this item. I was very excited to add this to robots (IFTTT) but after receiving and installing I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed.\n\n****- INSTALLATION is super easy. If you've changed out a lock before this will be no hard task. If not, you install the app, create an account, and then you can download a PDF of the instructions or you can watch videos. Very easy. Rekeying is also a really easy task. Put the new key in and turn sideways, put the Kwikset lock key (included) into the very small slot next to the keyhole, then put the existing key in and remove the lock key. Twist your existing key and you're done. If it doesn't work, do it again. Note that it says you may feel a click when you push in the lock key thing, but I did not. It didn't matter. Just push in firmly. The only down side was that my existing deadbolt hole (in the door frame) wasn't as deep as this needs to be. If you try to stop it anywhere less than fully extended the lock jams and you get an error and the app and touch access stops working. You have to use a key. So I had to drill out the bolt hole a bit. Once that was done we were good.\n\n**--- USE is minimal. With your phone always running the app (yes, it is always in your shade on Android) and Bluetooth always on you can tap the lock and it does work to unlock... several seconds later. The fencing is something I gave up on for several reasons. First, I don't want the house to lock me out just because I go outside or lock the doors just because I came inside. If I lived in an apartment with no one else this may be good for security. But I live in a home with several doors and 5 other people. Locking my kids outside just because my phone is inside isn't a goal. I like having control. I want a smart lock that I can choose to lock or not when I want to. This isn't that lock. You can use a key, which is great, because in setting this up I accidentally locked myself out a couple times!\n\n***-- APP is alright. It is slow as heck at times and doesn't recognize the lock via Bluetooth all the time. Even when I'm close. This is on a full door - no windows as have been issues for others - and up close. If you tap the unlock button it may or may not work in my experience.\n\n*---- CONNECTIVITY is where this \"smart\" lock really let me down. In order to be able to add this item to your Smart Home you have to buy an additional item, called a Kevo Pro, which your lock connects to via Bluetooth to allow it to connect to whatever hub you are using and/ or allow you to have access to lock or unlock remotely. I can't tell you strongly enough that the only reason I would recommend a smart lock is so that you can lock or unlock remotely. That's the whole point. I understand that this runs on batteries so putting out a WiFi signal may be a serious drain, but this could easily run on Z-Wave, ZigBee or other wireless to connect o the hub. It could also simply allow a hub to connect to it via Bluetooth, which other devices do. I see no reason other than profit margins that this can't connect to a hub as-is via Bluetooth.\n\n*---- PRICE is tough to swallow. At over $200 for just the local lock functionality this is already extremely highly priced against its competition. Consider the extra $100 just to get it only and you're talking about $325 for a connected lock. Consider that Schlage Connect BE469NX CAM 619 Touchscreen Deadbolt with alarm & Camelot Trim, Satin Nickel has 1500 reviews at 4.5 stars and is less than $200 and you get what I mean. At this price point I simply cannot recommend this. And the Kevo 1 came with an additional key fob, while this one does not. You have to buy those as well. You get two digital Bluetooth keys, but additional keys cost a few bucks.\n\n***-- OVERALL this is not very useful for me. I got two of them and am debating whether to even install the second one or take it back. I've had it installed for more than a week and I have NEVER yet used the Bluetooth touch unlock. It's simply faster to use a key. If this were Z-Wave I'd unlock in the car or have a robot (IFTTT recipe) tell the lock to unlock as I got home (along with opening the garage door and turning on the lights) but I cant. Because for some reason this Bluetooth only touch deadbolt costs more than many other smart locks but doesn't have their same functionality. I just don't get it. I don't recommend it even though technically it does do what it promises, if slowly."}

Touch to open works about 60% of the time for me... but 100% of the time for my wife. The issue is that I keep my phone in my back pocket which seems to be out of range already for the Kevo. Not a big deal, better a shorter range than a longer one. Twisting to bring my back pocket slightly closer works right away. My wife has had zero issues with the touch to open since her phone is in her shoulder bag.\n\nI do however, have general app issues. The app itself takes forever to find the lock and it doesn't respond as quickly as the touch to open. Android wear function is also slow to search for the lock and doesn't respond as quickly.\n\nWith regards to brute force attacks, I can't vouch for any improvements. But if you want to make it more secure against a kick-in, upgrade the strike plate. Wish they made it a grade 1 deadbolt.\n\nOnly drawback over 1st gen one is that it no longer comes with a fob (at this price it should) and only comes with 2 e-keys (4 would've been better considering they don't really cost Kwikset anything)\n\n*Update on updating the Kevo.

Still has an issue with 'brush locking' where the lock triggers while the door is being closed.

{"Author": "FRCP", "Date": "on November 10, 2016", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great smart lock!", "Text": "I upgraded from 1st Gen to 2nd Gen. My review of the 1st gen is reproduced below, as not much has changed between revisions. All of the below still applies. As for differences between the two, the only obvious difference is the smaller profile of the interior portion of the lock. It is much less of a giant beast inside, and makes the interior of the door look a lot cleaner. It is more difficult to access the internals (you now need to unscrew the outer housing), but this is a good thing as it means someone cannot easily toggle on auto lock. It will make battery changes take a few extra minutes, but that is no big deal.\n\nTriple touch is still the best feature in my opinion. Bluetooth seems to work a bit better on 2.0, but still is mostly hit with a few misses sprinkled in. It always opens eventually though.\n\nInstall is a bit easier as there is only a single wire now between the outer and inner portion. Sadly, wifi/remote connectivity still requires an upgrade. Hopefully 3rd gen will have wifi built in.\n\nThis is a cool product, with an upgrade option to make it wifi capable and thus even cooler. I have a couple issues with it, but not enough to lose a star.\n\nInstallation was very very easy. If you have ever replaced a deadbolt, you will be able to get through this installation in minutes. The only difference between a regular deadbolt replacement and this is that you will need to connect a couple of wires. Like I said, very very easy. If you have never replaced a deadbolt, the instructions are simple to follow. You can also pull up a video tutorial that will show you what to do.\n\nOperation of this is simple. My favorite feature is the triple tap to lock. You toggle a little switch inside the interior housing, and when you tap the outer portion of the deadbolt three times, the door locks instantly.\n\nBluetooth unlocking is a little less than perfect. Sometimes it unlocks when my phone is in my front or back pocket, but often I have to actually pull my phone out and get it very close to the lock. I keep meaning to recalibrate which will supposedly fix this issue. But even with having to pull my phone out, this still is more convenient than a regular. It is much easier to get a phone near the lock and tap the lock with arms full of kids and groceries than it is to find and insert and turn a key.\n\nAlso great is the ability to go for a run without any keys. I already carry my phone for the music and GPS tracking, so I am able to unlock my door when I get back without having keys bouncing around in my pockets.\n\nOverall I am very happy with the Kevo."}

Every time there is a new Apple update this sorry app has a complete melt down. You are going to love this, the lock STOPS recognizing your phone when you delete and reload the app which makes perfect sense when the app is NOT recognizing your phone to open your door. By doing this you apparently disable the Bluetooth on the lock itself. The app developers solution is to then, delete the app, reset your phone, download the app and try again. Guess what that doesn't work either!!! My son has an android and same problem. So NOW the answer is to purchase bluetooth fobs?? Isn't the whole point not to carry keys!!??? This is the sorriest product I have ever purchased. It only gets better, this happens to me today on a Sunday. Their customer isn't open!!! Had to call a locksmith. I can't wait to speak to Amazon, Kevo and the app developer tomorrow on this. I want my money back. This product should be sold its a scam because it does not work at all as it should. If you need to purchase more products like bluetooth fobs and kevo plus for this to work correctly then the answer is to raise the price and include it NOT con your customer into a crap product that only works if you keep coughing up money. They can all kiss my a$$ !\n\n*** PREPARE TO SPEND AN ADDITIONAL $100 FOR KEVO PLUS APP!*** I'm giving this 3 stars because they should make you more aware that in order for this product to work properly you'll need to pay Kwikset an additional $100 for Kevo Plus. It's great when it works right. My son takes the trash out and it automatically locks him out which my daughter thinks is funny. I have to wait for the app to come up on my phone to unlock the door and let him back in. If you forget your phone inside, take out the trash and it locks you out you are going to be upset. I need to figure out how to disable this. The app should be a little more user friendly. I think there is a switch on the lock to disable this auto lock feature. I really didn't like buying this and then a pop up asking me to download the app for additional $100 if you want to use it wirelessly. You can only unlock your door within bluetooth range and it does crash and give you problems. I use the latest iOS with an iPhone 6, I do find myself opening up my phone and making sure the app is up so that I can open the door which annoys me. For the I just carry my keys. I do like the fact that I was able to rekey the door to the same house key and that I can use my house key if necessary. This is was kept me from ordering the August Lock. I've heard once you download the app for an additional $100 these problems disappear but, paying $200 for a lock is already expensive. $300 is out of the question. Install was really easy and it does look cool. They need to fix these app problems and not charge $100 for Kevo Plus."}

I followed the steps in the Kevo app, and things went well. We got to the end, I pressed the green button on the back of the lock, held my iPhone up to the lock to pair, and -- nothing. I pored over the .pdf manual, and saw that the lock and the phone had to be on the same WiFi network. We have a bunch near the door, so I tried connecting my phone to another WiFi, and it worked immediately. It asked to download a software update for the lock, and we were done.\nUPDATE: While I like the concept, the need to have the app open for the last couple to work is REALLY irritating. I get to the door, touch the lock, the lights whir, and ..... nothing. Standing in the rain (of course), I pull out my phone, and find out the app isn't on. I click on the app, and five to ten seconds later, the door is ready to unlock. By this time, I could have used my key. This is not a true Bluetooth device, it's a cute proprietary link that works sometimes, except when it's cold or raining. Would I get it again? Probably not."}

It made noises and lit up but wouldn't move. So I called Kwikset, told them about my issue, and I spent 15 minutes on the phone trying things that the support person told me to try until we gave up and they said they'd send me a new one. I took a few photos, uploaded them to the portal they sent me, and then we had a very expensive non-smart deadbolt for two weeks.\n\n-The second one arrived in the mail sooner than I expected, and I had very high hopes. The door was all sanded and primed from the first install, so it went much easier the second time. I held my breath when I got to the door handing part, and voila! It worked. I installed it completely, messed around with it on the phone (with the e-Key) and it worked just fine. We then tried the \"touch to open\" and to close, and it was fussy. But, a few times coming and going, and the touch to open and lock seemed to be working flawlessly...\n\n-...Cut to 4 days later, when we got our first \"Low Battery\" notification.

The app is _very_ helpful, though. For example, it has you measure the various dimensions of the hole your old deadbolt left, then it gives you the directions for installing in those circumstances rather than some annoying 'if the door width is x, do y, but if the door width is a, do b'. (There is also a path for 'there wasn't already a deadbolt', but i didn't follow it, so i can't speak to its utility.)\n\nUltimately, i had two problems with the installation. First, the hole through which the bolt slides was too small in my door. I had to spend several 'fun' minutes sanding it out a few millimeters. Second, the correct pressure for the lock plate is very finicky. When i couldn't get the lock to work properly, i called the EXTREMELY HELPFUL support line, and they _very_ patiently walked me through loosening the plate several times until the lock was happy.\n\nNow, i have to admit, as much as the installation support person was awesome, patient, helpful, and wonderful, i do wish the lock plate wasn't so finicky. Maybe in Gen 3?\n\nSo, the app. You can lock and unlock with the press of a button. If you have the 'master' account, you can see a record of all app-based locking and unlocking, though manual bolt-turnings don't show up. You can share two permanent keys (the 'master' account has the option to limit day/time availability of those keys), buy more for a few dollars, and share one-day keys at will. It's pretty well done.\n\nThis is my first experience with a smart-lock, and if i decide to install more, i'll probably go with Kevo again."}

If you're fast, you can beat the bluetooth connection and you'll have to touch it a second time. But it's still convenient to me.

There are a lot of non standard doors out there but if you have a standard door, it's easy. If you're not sure, check the manual on Kwikset's website for the door measurements before you buy this.\n\nThere are some limitations and pros to a bluetooth lock. One of the downsides is that you're at the mercy of both Kwikset's software and your phone maker's operating system. There was a bug in Apple's IOS 10 that was fixed in 10.0.2 that wouldn't allow this Kevo software to work unless the app was open. Now with 10.0.2, you can go back to just having the Kevo app running in the background and your door can unlock. I had problems at first till I saw a write-up on the issue. It's fixed now as long as you're still on 9 or have upgraded to at least IOS 10.0.2. But it's a good reminder that this stuff can break and even be no fault of Kwikset.\n\nBut once I got beyond that bug, this has really worked well. I've realized that it won't work with gloves, so I'm not sure what I'm going to do for winter. I guess I'll see if it works with touchscreen gloves.

In addition with enabling blue-tooth, 1) enable location services 2) enable wi-fi services. If you do those things, then you don't have to have the Kevo app open on your phone. What is puzzling is that you can turn location services off and it works sometimes. This is not very well documented on the Kevo FAQ.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the battery life on the door is way too short - 4 AA batteries should last longer than 30 days. You don't know the batteries are dead until everything stops working. Since the lock can communicate to the Kevo app on you phone even though it's not running - it should communicate low battery to your phone. I am going to wait until Kwikset fixes this - Gen 3 perhaps?\n\nI have seen the complaints about the lock extending when the door is open on accidental touching - you learn not to inadvertently touch the lock - it's not a big deal. Overall, not having to fish out your keys from your purse/pocket when your hands are full is a worth the few idiosyncrasies you have to learn work around."}

Directions were straight forward and very easy to follow. I paired the lock with my wife's phone configured the Kevo app to run in the background. Once this was done I left the area for a couple hours and then came back and touched the lock. It immediately unlocked without any delays. I was very impressed. The next step was to set my phone up to work with it. It was easy enough to send an Ekey to my phone. I'm not sure if I was doing something wrong but I could not get the lock to work with me touching it. I could pull up the app and hit lock and unlock from my phone and it would work. In my opinion this isn't any more and maybe less convenient than using a key. My wife is the one that is more apt to be coming home with her hands full and she is tickled to death with only having to touch the lock to get inside so it serves it's purpose. I haven't used the option that allows temporary Ekeys to be sent out yet but I can see where this will be helpful in the future."}

It cannot be bumped, and unlike a lot of smart locks, all the research I read said it was very secure physically with the actual locking mechanism. Also, the encryption is excellent, so the digital keys are secure. The makers put a LOT of work into making a very strong lock.\n\nThe design could be better though. My door isn't that old - I haven't even painted it yet, and it came with standard holes already in it. We have all our doorknobs above the deadbolts. Well, this deadbolt goes up so high that it hits the base of the doorknob, which means to change the batteries, I have to take the doorknob off! It has a battery pack that slides down into it, and it is positioned so the doorknob gets in the way. If I'd realized this, I'd not have got it. I don't know if I will keep it or not, I suppose once the batteries run down, I'll make that call of switching everything out or not. I might leave it and just use it as a lock though because it is a good lock. Without batteries though, I lose all the smart function. It would be better for people that have the deadbolt on TOP of the doorknob if it were shorter.\n\nAlso, the unit opens without a key to the inside. I have one door with a window in it, and you could just bust a window out, reach in and open it. It wouldn't work well in doors like those. My deadlocks on those doors currently have to have a key from the inside. The touch function would make it so easy to do away with the hand close function. Just be aware of that if you have doors with windows close to the knobs.\n\nIt doesn't come with a fob. They are $19-$29 everywhere that I looked. I feel like they should have included at least one. They did with the first generation, from what I can gather. I had saw those reviews so I thought this would have one too, but it doesn't. You don't want the first generation locks though, there were physical problems that left them vulnerable, so they redesigned it and made it a stronger product.\n\nIf you have a APPLE I PHONE 4s or up, the app will work. If you have a ANDROID, beware that you cannot go by your OS. I have the latest Android but this app will not work on ANY of my phones. Sony Xperia Z3+, brand new Axon- nope. It mainly seems to like Samsung Galaxy phones. There's a list on the website you can check. I will tell you that sometimes it is cheaper to buy an older Apple 4s that has a bad ESIN than a fob though, and that will give you full access to the app's functionality.\n\nInstallation was pretty easy - my husband did it and it took about 15 minutes, but he had an existing deadbolt hole. He got a bit miffed that he had to print out instructions to install it and set it up. It did not come with them.\n\nAfter he got it installed, it was easy to activate and it works PERFECTLY. It's a bit noisy when it opens, with a mechanical sound, but that's not annoying and it doesn't last long. It's just a bit more noise than if someone puts a key in the lock to come in.\n\nIt comes with 2 physical keys.\nIt comes in 3 colors, and they are all attractive, so it is easy to match them to your door knob. The circular lights give them an attractive, modern look from the outside.\n\n1 star off because I really feel they nickel and dime you on having to buy expensive fobs if wanted, and charging for virtual keys. 1 star off for poor Android support and unit being an inch too long to allow paccess to batteries if placed below instead of above the knob."}

There are times, about 25% of the time that it takes a few times to get the bluetooth to connect. In those instances it would be faster to use the key and be done with it. Also, wish it was home kit compatible. I don't like the fact that after the 2 extra keys are sent you have to pay for the other keys. Having to buy another piece to get Internet connectivity is a rip off in a premium product. It should really be included or having it HomeKit compatible would solve that problem and not have to take up a jack in my router.\n\nOverall, not as impressed as I should have been. Lots of promise but the nickel and dime of Kwikset is unacceptable especially in a second gen product that should work reliably 100% of the time.

This seems like a neat upgrade that will simplify a couple of issues in my world at first glance. First off the idea of being able to issue a limited or restricted use key to certain people - the dog sitter for example - is very nice rather than having that person always have a permanent physical key to our home. Or being able to send a friend coming to town a temporary digital key to get in the house that expires or can be deleted later. Except....This system does not work quite like that. You have to purchase those extra key codes separately each time or spend another hundred dollars for a full upgrade. Nope. I'm back to just spending a few bucks at the physical key smith, so no upgrade there.\n\nAdditionally, even if I were inclined to pay Kwikset more money for those digital keys, I can't use them and I am not sure that half the folks who might get one could use them either. Why? Because unless you have the most current two Apple phones or a very limited list of Samsung Galaxy phones, you cannot even download the Kevo app. Without the app the entire Bluetooth aspect of this lock is completely nonfunctional. I can't even download the app to my LG V10 running marshmallow or my husband's Sony Xperia X phone. Both are current generation phones from this summer.\n\nIt did offer to download on my neighbor's iPhone 6, but I don't live in her house and I am not going be borrowing her phone to get into my house! Bottom line for me is that I have no interest in buying another phone or buying one of the Kwikset special key fobs for this lock because it can't speak to either of the non Apple non Samsung phones we already own. I will just stick with the very solid, dependable, good looking, non digital Schlage locks we currently own."}

{"Author": "Dr. Stuart Gitlow", "Date": "on October 25, 2016", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Works well with iPhone 7 and iOS 10.1. Straightforward installation and operation.", "Text": "Step 1 - Remove the original deadbolt. I have a garage deadbolt where the lock had corroded. After a few occasions when the key would get stuck in the lock, I figured it was time to replace it. Removal required removal of two screws from the inside lock after which everything pulled out pretty easily.\n\nStep 2 - Install the app and register. The app worked quickly and easily to accomplish this. It then presents illustrated video instructions as to how to install the new lockset step by step. No new holes are needed in the door, so if you're simply replacing a lockset, you don't need a drill.\n\nStep 3 - Proceed with installation. The deadbolt didn't quite fit into the hole in the door. I initially made the mistake of not drilling out the hole to be just a little larger and figured I could simply hammer in the deadbolt assembly. This resulted in total destruction of the assembly, which fell apart in the door. Luckily, two deadbolt assemblies come with the unit, so I made the hole a little larger and went for the second deadbolt assembly. Not quite the right one for the job, but ultimately it works perfectly well. After that, the installation went smoothly.\n\nStep 4 - Install the battery pack and set up the unit. Again, this went smoothly and the unit's internal motor worked nicely on testing.\n\nStep 5 - Pair the unit with my iPhone. I was using the iPhone7 with iOS 10.0.2. Pairing didn't work. I tried several more times with the same result. Luckily, as I was attempting the installation, Apple released iOS 10.1. I upgraded my phone. Pairing was then accomplished very quickly. I can now walk to the garage and as long as I have my phone with me, the app running, and BlueTooth turned on, I can unlock the door with a touch of my finger. To lock it by touch requires changing a dip switch near the programming switch. Otherwise you have to use the key or the app to lock the door.\n\nEverything works as it should, but several issues:\n\n1) I have the Venetian Bronze unit. This looks like a flat black from more than a foot away and is nice for a high-tech appearance. Some shiny bronze shows through, however, and it looks more like there are scratches in the finish than anything else. I think I'd prefer a powder-coat black to the Venetian Bronze, which is probably closer to what people choosing this finish would want.\n\n2) The interior side of the lockset is fairly large to accommodate the batteries and the motor. It would be nice to make this smaller so it doesn't look like a large box attached to your door. No problem in the garage but I'm not sure I'd want this in the house since it might detract from the overall appearance of the door.\n\n3) The interior side has a thumb switch to lock and unlock the deadbolt. It would be nice to have an option for a key on the inside instead of the thumbswitch. I always prefer keys on both sides for better burglary protection, though others prefer the hand knob for fire protection reasons.\n\n4) The installation instructions do not go into detail as to the meaning behind the various LED colors which the lock can flash. The downloadable manual, however, has greater detail. You should definitely download the full manual. There are a number of options which can be set up as well.\n\n5) Changing the batteries requires removal of three very short screws. These are easy to lose, though only two are necessary to hold the outside housing in place on the inside of the door.\n\nOne nice aspect is that my deadbolt did not result in the locking hub precisely centering in the keyset opening. Nevertheless, the unit works perfectly. It has a significant margin for error that is appreciated. There will undoubtedly be a point in the future when the electronics break, or when apps are no longer available, or when you can't get replacement batteries, at which point the unit works the same way as a normal lock, with a key on the outside and a switch on the inside. The lock itself is therefore good for the normal life of a lock."}

Definitely a 1st world device that is totally unnecessary.\n\nAlso, my big issue: if you use a bluetooth headset, as I do most of the time, most phones (even my state of the art nexus 6P) are unable to connect to more than 1 bluetooth device at once. Therefore, this lock is rendered completely useless, as it connects to your phone via bluetooth.\n\nI will say it was easy to install and had an excellent video to guide you through it.

Even after I upgraded to 10.0.2, the lock would generally only function if I had the Kevo app on my phone's screen. This of course totally defeats the purpose of this lock. If I need to take my phone out of my pocket and open an app every time I want to lock or unlock the door, then I might as well just use a key. Perhaps this issue will get fixed over time with some type of update to IOS, the Kevo app, or the firmware on the lock itself, but I am not going to hold on to a $200+ lock that does not work as intended in hopes that they will eventually figure it out.

First, and I consider myself an avid researcher- ESPECIALLY when I am spending $250 after taxes on a dead bolt- I did not expect that I'd have to spend $99 more on an upgrade in order to be able to lock/unlock my door when out of range of bluetooth access. This is an absurd amount of money to charge for linking the app to the lock over a reliable connection, since the bluetooth connection between the app and the lock is crap. Which brings me to my second gripe. Living in a second floor flat, I am literally never within 20 feet of my door and therefore am unable to remotely lock/unlock my door unless I'm standing right next to it...and even then, connection between the app and the lock is nonexistent 98% of the time. The ability to get in/out of the house with a simple touch rather than fumbling for my keys when I've got groceries and two kids in tow is wonderful, but it would also be nice to be able to use the other features advertised after spending such an exorbitant amount of money. Also, it seems crazy that there's not even a single fob included for the price I paid, though at least I was aware when I purchased the lock that a fob wouldn't be included."}
{"Author": "neurotome", "Date": "on September 30, 2016", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Fancy future lock would be awesome if it actually worked", "Text": " I've had to edit this review. I really wanted this lock to be great; instead, I can't recommend this lock to anyone for any reason. It can be coaxed to work as designed, but it doesn't keep working and it doesn't offer the security you get from a $20 non-SmartKey Kwikset deadbolt.\n\nIf you're interested in why, two EDITS follow, followed by the original review. If you're not interested, this review is over.\n\nEDIT: Lock quit working less than 24 hours after install; won't touch-open or closed. I spent about 10 minutes trying to troubleshoot it, including resetting and repairing; couldn't re-pair. Problem might be my Apple TV, which is supposedly incompatible if it is less than 10 ft away (it's 18 ft away.) I don't really care. I didn't get this lock with the idea that I was going to have to scour my house and discard incompatible gadgets; I got it with the idea that it would work. It doesn't work. I'm sure if I put another hour into it I could get it working again. Guess what? An hour per day is more than I'll be investing in a front door lock, Kwikset. Zero minutes per day is what you need to be targeting for maintenance if you expect people to use your lock.\n\nEDIT 2: I got the lock working again. It does not work if there is an Apple TV (4th gen.) powered on within 50 ft. I should probably disclose, by the way, that it took about 10 attempts to make the video you see; sometimes the lock takes 15+ seconds to cycle even when there's no interference.\n\nMeanwhile, I looked around the Internet to learn more about Kwikset's SmartKey technology. Deadbolt locks with SmartKey can be brute-force opened by hand, quietly, with a screwdriver-like tool, a pair of vise grips, and 25 ft-lbs of force. It takes 15 seconds tops - check YouTube. Although this usually breaks the SmartKey rekey functionality, it leaves no marks on the lock and the lock may even continue to work with its current key. For me, this isn't an acceptable level of security for a $200+ deadbolt.\n\nThis lock is out of my door and won't be back. It's a neat idea, and someday, when Kwikset or another vendor gets it to the point where the technology works and improves the security to match that of a $20 non-rekeyable deadbolt, I might consider installing such a lock. Original review follows for anyone who's still interested.\n\nTL;DR: the future\u2019s here, your lock will recognize you and let you into your house, which is about the neatest thing I\u2019ve seen this year. See attached video, and read on for more.\n\nI just installed this Kwikset Kevo 2 smart deadbolt lock, replacing an old Kwikset dumb deadbolt and paired it with an iPhone 6 running iOS 10.0.2. It took about 2 hours. First I\u2019m going to write about the installed lock - see the video - and then I\u2019m going to write a bit about the install process.\n\nThe lock itself is great. The outside is polished brass covering the steel innards, and it looks a lot like the 25 year old deadbolt it replaced, except it\u2019s not all pitted; it has an insulating plastic ring where it contacts the door; and it has a ring of multicolor LEDs that can pulse around the outer rim. If you don\u2019t know the LEDs are there, you might not notice them until you touch the lock, at which point they light up bright blue. It\u2019s handsome, it\u2019s a very classic Kwikset design, and it was a perfect finish match for the new Schlage polished brass handleset I decided to install with it. The innards have the classic sturdy Kwikset feel. The door-side handle is a plastic case, coated with a brass-like plating, with a smoked plastic window, and frankly in comparison to the outside it looks and feels a bit cheap - I prefer a metal deadbolt handle, but this one is plastic and feels plastic.\n\nSo. You\u2019re standing outside your door. You touch the padlock\u2019s metal part, and it lights up blue. Do you have a paired bluetooth device? If not, you\u2019re done; the padlock will flash for a while and go dark.\n\nPairing was easy, took about a minute, required email verification. The iOS app requires Bluetooth, Location Services and ability to be active with those features in the background; it works in Low Power Mode. If you\u2019re running iOS 10, it needs to be upgraded to at least 10.0.2; 10.0 apparently broke the app. You can also pair your lock with an included keychain fob if you don\u2019t have an iPhone or don\u2019t want to run the app, but I didn\u2019t bother.\n\nSo you\u2019re standing there with your phone in your pocket. You touch the deadbolt\u2019s metal part. It lights up blue. Then it lights up green and the motor whirs like a bobcat growl, opening the deadbolt. Touch again with the door closed - it lights up blue, then yellow as the padlock whirs to the locked position. After each of these operations, a pair of earsplitting beeps happen - a control-G, an ASCII 07 BEL - hey Kwikset! 1982 happened already! Give us a setting to turn these beeps off, they\u2019re loud, they echo, they\u2019ll wake up everyone in the house.\n\nThere\u2019s a couple problems with a Bluetooth lock. Do you store your phone less than 20 feet from your door while you\u2019re home? Then anyone can unlock your deadbolt! Or, if you\u2019re outside, loitering near the door with the phone in your pocket - again, anyone can unlock the padlock. In practice however, it was more like 6 feet in my tests.\n\nLet\u2019s envision a scenario where there\u2019s an attacker, someone who wants to defeat the deadbolt and gain entry. He gets in easier - he doesn\u2019t need to struggle with you for the key; he just touches the lock while you\u2019re nearby. If you are in the habit of answering your door or even walking by it with your phone on your person, you\u2019ll need to break that habit because coming to the door with your phone enables the attacker to unlock your door from the other side.\n\nOn the other hand, this ease of opening may be a plus. Suppose some crazy person has a gun to your head and wants your door open. Do you want to be fumbling around with a ring of keys, wasting time and annoying the criminal? No, you really don\u2019t; you want the door open immediately. The Kevo opens pretty quick - not instant; maybe 10 seconds - and it\u2019s easier than fumbling with a key. And the beep wakes up anyone who might be inside who could come to your aid. :/\n\nStill, I love the Star Trek future lock that knows it\u2019s me and opens right up. I am reasonably confident the Bluetooth security protocol can\u2019t be MIM\u2019d or otherwise reverse engineered, and I actually used the super long screws and the included strike plate - my previous strike plate only had 2 shorty screws - so I think this lock is actually better security than what I replaced.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk install. Here\u2019s a list of things I needed in addition to the Phillips Head screwdriver and tape measure they recommend: 1/4\u201d chisel, 3/8\u201d chisel, mallet, power drill, 5/32\u201d drill bit, 1/8\u201d drill bit, spackle, doorjamb paint, sandpaper, masking tape. All this extra stuff was to install the strikeplate. A few sizes of Phillips Head, and magnetic ones, are recommended.\n\nThe door I installed this in has been sticky and balky and the hardware was worn out. I painted it red, did my best to adjust the sticky places, and got a new handleset. The first thing I found was that my door\u2019s 1-1/2\u201d hole was perfect for the old deadbolt latch; but even on the shortest setting, the new latch was about 1/8\u201d too long. The torque rod therefore wasn\u2019t quite straight, but everything hooked up and more or less worked with a little grunting. The outer deadbolt doesn\u2019t quite mate to the door - about a 1mm gap on one side - but the included steel ring adapter prevents a anything from getting at the innards that way short of destroying the door. I was worried that this would increase the torque needed to move the bolt - and it did if the long mounting screws were overtightened - but the motor seems pretty tough, it gets the job done.\n\nAnother problem that carried over from the old door was that the door is sticky and alignment of the deadbolt didn\u2019t work with either the old strikeplate or the new longer strikeplate I got. I had to install the included strikeplate, but I\u2019m glad I did. You need to drill 5/32\u201d pilot holes for the large strikeplate screws and 1/8\u201d for the small screws; if you do, you won\u2019t need an impact driver to turn the screws home. If the bolt isn\u2019t aligned properly, the ring will flash red and alert you it\u2019s jammed; still, the old door also had to be fiddled with to get the old deadbolt to turn - it\u2019s better now - so in fairness to Kwikset, this isn\u2019t a problem with their lock, it\u2019s a problem with my janky old door. Maybe the next earthquake will fix it.\n\nI easily rekeyed the lock the first time by following the instructions. That\u2019s pretty neat. It\u2019s going to put a few locksmiths out of business. The deadbolt works fine with the traditional key or handle method, by the way - doesn\u2019t light up, doesn\u2019t beep, acts just like any deadbolt would and with the same Kwikset smoothness and sturdy quality you\u2019d expect.\n\nBottom line - the future\u2019s here, your lock will recognize you and let you into your house, which is about the neatest thing I\u2019ve seen this year. Cons include cheap-looking interior lock, loud beeps that can\u2019t be disabled, necessity of replacing batteries - I doubt 4 AA\u2019s are going to last long - and a bit of a tricky install; no shame in hiring a professional, I sort of wish I had. But now I'm going to freak out all my friends with my fancy future lock!"}

I loved the idea. The product itself, however, does not deliver. It has faulty apps and software. Let's talk about the install first. There are no paper instructions. Only way to get instructions is to download the app and then use that to guide you along. So if you're someone who likes to see all the steps laid out before you, you won't have that. Instead, it will go through each step one by one and you would need to hit next to get to the next step.\n\nNow I tried to pair the item up and we tried to use it. However, the app itself only will install for my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 but not my husband's Blu R1 HD - which is still an Android run phone but it will not work for this. The first time, it decided to do an update so I let it sit there while it did the update. After that, I tried many times to tap it and it would sometimes work and sometimes not. Then the app would many times just be stuck on Connecting and not really connect like it should. The history was also wrong. It kept saying that it locked/unlocked at certain times but didn't do anything.\n\nI tried to delete the eKey and then re-pair it and instead just get the message that it cannot pair and try to check location and bluetooth, which were both turned on.\n\nI ended up giving up and putting our old lock back on. Until the app and software improves, we will not be installing this. First, the app needs to be consistent in connection to the lock.

Installation was fairly easy guided through online videos, you can view these on Kevo's website ahead of buying.. Lock works great, My door does have a window and side windows as well, no issues with connecting or usage as one reviewer reported. The second generation lock comes with three eKeys, and unlimited guest keys, but no FOB for the 2nd generation, you can buy a FOB if you need it, I just use my phones. Bluetooth range is much better than I expected able to access the lock from 40 feet away easily. Touch to unlock feature works well, seems that an extended touch seems to work better than a quick tap. I am little disappointed by lack of wide range of Android supported phone models but side loading the app from a supported Samsung Galaxy model allowed my other Android phones work fine. Also connects to Android Wear LG G2 watch, works great no issues. Software updates (phone to lock) are limited to the supported phone models so that might be something to consider. The three touches to lock feature when your leaving is great, kids in the neighborhood are now locking the door when they leave, nice. After successful install and week of testing, I added the optional WiFi gateway (Kevo Plus) $99 which allows you to access the lock from anywhere. Also gives 99+ eKeys. It's great to be able to confirm the lock status when away from home or unlock the door if needed. The app also allows you integrate with Ring Pro doorbell so you can see whose at the door and then unlock. Great feature set really pleased with operation, for those with Apple devices it looks like release 10.0.2 resolved the touch to unlock bug. I highly recommend this deadbolt, hoping add a couple more if it goes on sale. Be sure you get the 2nd generation, front of box says \"2nd Generation\" and model number is Kevo2 Kwikset Kevo (2nd Gen) Touch-to-Open Bluetooth Smart Lock in Satin Nickel"}

Maybe a 2 star rating is unfair because i haven't opened the box. But I am so disappointed with the known issues that affect it's functionality. Because of the IOS 10 bug I had planned to use key fobs until the issue was resolved. But then I learned of the Apple TV issue. I verified with Kevo support that a current generation Apple TV running TVOS 10 in close proximity to a lock will prevent the lock from opening electronically with key fobs or supported phones. There is an apparent conflict or interference caused by a Bluetooth 4 Low Energy \"peripheral mode\" feature that is enabled in the Apple TV TVOS 10 operating system. While I disabled automatic updates on my Apple TV the box keeps asking to update. An accidental update of the Apple TV would then render the electronic functions of the Kevo Gen 2 useless. I can't take that risk. And I don't want to be forced to hold back on Apple updates until all these issues are resolved. I wanted so much for this to work. I still have confidence that Kevo and Apple will work out the bugs. I'm just disappointed this product was released at the same time as IOS 10 and TVOS 10. If you don't have Apple products then the lock may work for you. For me - I'm going to wait."}

Enter the Kwikset Kevo (2nd Gen) Touch-to-Open Bluetooth Smart Lock in Venetian Bronze. Here are my thoughts;\n\nPros\n\n+ Open your door with your Smartphone or a key fob.\n\n+ Sleek look and design.\n\n+ Get alerts and monitor lock history.\n\n+ Relatively easy to install.\n\nCons\n\n- Mobile app needs a bit of work as it's rather slow.\n\n- Key fob pairing can still be a bit bothersome.\n\n- Quite expensive.\n\nThe Kwikset Kevo (2nd Gen) Touch-to-Open Bluetooth Smart Lock in Venetian Bronze is a solid idea but with results that aren't quite perfected. Key-less entry on cars is basically standard now on new models. However, home locks just aren't there just yet. I love the look and design of this lock and opening/locking it simply by using your Smartphone from anywhere is great. Also it's nice for piece of mind if you think you forgot to lock the door when you left home. Unfortunately, a few of the downsides of this lock, starting with the high cost will turn away many potential buyers. This is my first Smart Lock so I can't speak on improvements from the previous generation. In the end the Kwikset Kevo (2nd Gen) Touch-to-Open Bluetooth Smart Lock in Venetian Bronze is nice investment but just be aware that everything may not work as perfectly as you may expect."}

This was very easy to install with all of the instructions in a very easy to follow format within the app. I was intimidated by the potential difficulty but this was just as easy to install as I read. There is a current bug with Apple devices running IOS 10, but the app was very insistent to let me know that. If you do not have the app open it does not function properly, but it is very good at reminding me to leave the app open when I close it without thinking. My wife uses an Android phone and has had no issues at all. This was well worth the money and I will be purchasing the plus add-on soon to get the ability to lock and unlock when I'm away from home.

This is a second generation Kevo product. I am NOT a tech savvy person, but this was really easy to set up, and came with simple, easy to follow instructions. I have a iPhone 6, and it was really easy to install the Kevo app on mt iPhone. The inital set-up was a bit time consuming (not complicated, just time consumming), but about two hours in, I had the app on my phone, completed all the updates, and I even sent the Ekeys (electronic keys) to my family members, so they could go into my house if they dropped by to visit me before I got home. This is so much safer and better than hiding a spare house key for my kids outside my house, which is what I was doing for years! I feel much better about this security feature on my house.\n\nI know some users said they had problems with the iOS 10 upgrade causing them trouble with their Kevo app, but so far I haven't had any issues with it.

By better, I mean faster and more intelligent.", "Text": "UPDATE: I do not recommend. The connectivity as if late has been sketchy. While standing no farther than a foot away, I could not open the door with my phone. Neither phone nor Kevo have had updates since my last use. I don't trust that the lock will consistently perform. If not for the house key I randomly thought to pocket, I'd be waiting for a locksmith.\n\nINITIAL REVIEW: I would truly give this product three and a half stars if Amazon allowed the option.\n\nInstallation was easy enough. If you've ever installed a lock, the process will be a breeze. I was, however, disappointed in the fasteners. If you are considering installing this lock in the place of certain Kwikset competitor locks, do not toss your fasteners. They were down right flimsy compared to the screws that held my previous lock in place. Additionally, be prepared to either download or use a device to read the installation and registration instructions, as no such printed materials are included in the packaging.\n\nI took the time to change a couple of settings from the factory default. My lock will now automatically lock after thirty seconds and it is now equipped to lock by tapping the external lock face three times. Both settings work as stated. Again, I was a bit disappointed to find the the door would lock regardless of door position. It would have been nice if Kwikset used similar technology found in home alarm systems that use a magnetic feedback to the unit to indicate that the door is in position to be locked or not. Using either features, the deadbolt will extend and the app will indicate the the door is locked, even when the door is standing wide open.\n\nI was able to re-key the lock, using the provided tool and instructions. This went off went off without a hitch.\n\nThe internal housing leaves much to be desired. To access the battery, one must visit the toolbox as you will need to handle three screws. It is a bit ironic that the lock is sold to make our lives easier, yet you need tools to access the batteries. Additionally, if you want the ability to change the factory defaults or reset the device, you must either make the decision to remove certain screws during installation or disassemble the housing the access those points.\n\nThe device and app work on my Android phone. I've not experienced any crashing or failures. It would have been lovely if Kwikset would have simply included internet connectivity with the lock rather than force the user to pay for an upgrade. If you are unwilling to pay for the upgrade, users will have to download the Kevo app to their phone to access the lock. I feel a little odd asking guests, even those staying for an extended time to download an app to their phone.\n\nThe app is slow. Painfully slow. And inconsistent. Some days I can access the lock from my couch other days I have to move the phone closer to the door before the bluetooth connection picks up. Even then, it can take up to twenty seconds before the lock engages after taping my phone to either lock or unlock the door. If the app and lock were consistent at twenty to thirty feet, the time lag would not bother me as much. However, when I am standing at the door and it is still searching for the connection, I can not only find my key in the bottom of the bottomless purse, but also unlock the door and be on the way to a cocktail by the time the app wakes up, connects, and unlocks the door.\n\nOverall, it does what it says it does. It could be better. By better, I mean faster and more intelligent."}

There is a bug in apple's software and there is no ETA on when apple will fix this bug. What this means?

For me, it takes about a minute of presses to get the door to lock or unlock. Sometimes more. I've held the fob next to the lock, against the lock, away from the lock, every angle, every position, all with direct sight. Nothing seems to help. I've reset the calibration in hopes that this will re-calibrate the key fob without any success.

The appearance is a definite improvement... it is more compact, and feels so much more durable and high-end than the Kevo1. The lock responds to my lock and unlock commands twice as fast as before. The app works very well for me. At one point, it required me to hold my phone too close to the door, but after talking to support I found out the reason it was requiring me to hold it so close to the lock was because that's where I held my phone the first several times I used it -- which trained the lock that that's the appropriate distance for me. We reset / recalibrated it and now it works perfectly with the phone still in my pocket. The touch to open experience is definitely my favorite feature of this lock. It's something that none of the other locks have. I don't want to have to \"talk\" to my lock through Siri or have it automatically open... for me, that's a security risk.

First and foremost, one of my biggest complaints with this is the app that you must use to unlock the door. It's buggy as can be, and really needs a massive improvement before this could be considered \"ready for the market\". I would say that half the time I went to use the app it would crash on my phone. I tried it on my partner's phone -- same thing. Frustrating.\n\nNext, I did not like the fact that there was zero internet connectivity with this lock. Friend coming over? You can't just unlock it from remote. Nope, you have to generate a key, have them download the app, etc. etc. In this day and age of the connected smarthome there really is no excuse for this not to connect up to one of the many different hubs on the market.\n\nInstallation was straightforward, and I had it installed in less than 15 minutes.

A more obscure help article said \u2018third switch from the left\u2019 which turned out to be correct. But between the poor documentation and no response from Kwikset customer service, I felt I\u2019d wait until a company really nails a smart lock / app / support that we\u2019ve come to expect from companies like Nest and Apple.\n\nI just finished re-installing my old school key locks and feel a sense of relief."}

Our eleven year old son has been fascinated with locks and keys since he was very little. He has a collection of many various brands and types of locks. When this new Kevo came out we had to try it out.\n\nInstallation of the lock and mobile app was easy and straight forward. It took us about thirty minutes to get the lock and app installed and up and running. The lock itself seems to work smooth and is very responsive. We have had several moments where the lock doesn't unlock on the first attempt. Maybe the phone wasn't close enough.\n\nThe first door we installed this lock on is well sealed to the point we normally have to push/pull it a little when we lock and unlock it. Needless to say it didn't function well on it. So, we moved it to a door that wasn't as tight and we didn't have any functioning issues as far as the bolt freely moving.\n\nSending an electronic key through the app to someone is pretty easy, but you may incur additional costs if more than a couple people need them. It is a great convenience to be able to send a temporary electronic key to a family member who comes to town and gets home before you do.\n\nOur boy really loves the lock and how it functions. He showcased it to one of our neighbors who is a commercial electrician who was very impressed too.\n\nWe know how the new ios10 has caused some issues and we haven't upgraded our smartphone yet.\n\nThe feel and build of the Kevo is top notch. Family and friends who have seen it operate have been amazed."}

Was hoping for a better answer than \"hoping Apple will fix their bug\" from Kwikset. nice way to pass the buck... how about offering the affected user community who just purchased the gen 2 Kevo the Kevo key fobs for free?\n\nKevo was very easy to setup but definitely has its issues. The lock itself and all the provided hardware and instructions are excellent, there online tutorial videos help and make the installation and setup very easy. I was looking forward to using this lock to be able to lock/unlock without having to always getting my keys out and fumbling wWith them, but apparently it doesn't work that way. I have a iPhone 6 Plus that is supposed to be supported, but the touch to lock/unlock only works with my phone out, and app open in the foreground. If the app is open and the screen off, the lock will not respond. I enabled all the permissions requested during setup and still no luck. The phone needs to be 'on' with the kevo app open which seems too much of a hassle, and since this doesn't come with the wireless key fob, it only works like a normal lock... So I'm not sure if paying $200+ for a regular lock that only works by pulling out my phone and starting the app all the time is worth it. Might as well use a normal key to open the door... It's much quicker to do so. I've also tried it with my wife's iPhone 6 and it also has the same issue, kevo only works with the kevo app open and in the foreground. I'd rather fumble and risk dropping keys rather than my phone."}

In between the time I ordered it and the time it arrived it stopped being supported by Apple products. iOS 10 was released so opening it with your phone is way more cumbersome than simply using a key. They support very few Androids. And, there is no fob in the box. This lock is pointless, now. I am going to have to return it. (See website for details of when this will be fixed. SPOILER: They have to hope that Apple fixes it.....someday).\n\nApart from support issues, I encourage you to look at the app reviews prior to purchasing this. It looks like even when they support a platform their software is terrible/unreliable. And, even after charging so much for a deadbolt they charge for many \"extra\" features that other manufacturers include for free. (You know, the features that would make this a smart lock). I knew that last part prior to purchasing it, but after installing and having so many issues I cannot understand how they have the audacity to charge such premium pricing.\n\nWhile I'm sure their intentions are good, Kwikset just isn't committed to investing in the resources necessary to make and support a real smart device. It is more like a fun side hobby. In that regard, it is an excellent effort. But, for now, this thing is far from prime time ready. Save your money until better locks or broader (and better) support arrive. They should really pull this lock from the market for now to avoid bad reviews."}

As a recognized gadget freak, I've surprised even myself with my unwillingness to trust this device to work properly. The main issue is that if someone else in the home leaves their Kwikset connected phone near the door someone only need touch the lock to unlock it.

My front door hardware was in need of an upgrade, as it has been over 10 years since we replaced it.\n\nInstallation: It took me about an hour to install the lock, but half of the time was trying to find screws that I dropped, my tools, etc. I didn't have to do any chiseling or any other modifications to my door, it fit perfectly where the prior Schlage deadbolt hardware was (not counting a little bit of a residue from the ring on the old deadbolt). The video that was provided in the app was helpful and well done.\n\nApp: The main reason for buying this lock is if you are going to use the app and the \"smart\" features. I first downloaded the app for my iPhone. My wife and I both have an iPhone and we created an account and installed our keys no problem. Also sent an eKey to my mother-in-law, who also has an iPhone. No problems on iOS. I also wanted my teenage daughter to have a key, and by this point I needed to purchase an additional eKey (as only 2 are included). It cost me a few bucks after tax. I wasn't excited about purchasing another key, but the price isn't too bad for the convenience.\n\nAfter purchasing the key and unsuccessfully downloading the app, I learned that my daughter's phone (an LG Flex 2) isn't one of the 3 brands that Kevo supports (a few models of Nexus, Samsung, or the HTC One M9) although it has Android 5.1 installed. I didn't see the fine print that only \"select models\" were available until after I purchased the eKey. CHECK THE WEB SITE TO MAKE SURE YOUR PHONE IS SUPPORTED BEFORE YOU BUY A KEY. I removed one star for this information not as clear as it could have been.\n\nUPDATE TO REVIEW: based on some research, I found that this lock appeared to be easily broken into. However, Kwikset provided me some useful information about some of the top locksmiths attempting to break in (in fact, I think it's in a response to this review). I really appreciate how they not only replied to my review, but also a few tweets. They really did their detective work and want to make sure the proper information is getting out there.\n\nThere does appear to be a \"Smart Key / Dumb Key Force Tool\" that may be able to pick the lock which costs about $100. Kwikset told me that by law, these aren't supposed to be sold to anyone but Locksmiths... Hopefully that is the case, and the average criminal probably isn't carrying one of these around. Fortunately, I have an alarm system and will continue to be relying on that. It is really a tradeoff of security vs. convenience and I wish I knew more before I bought this and installed it. Hope this is helpful to you.\n\nI raised my review up to 4 stars from 2 stars, because of the updated information that Kwikset provided and taking the time to do the research. It made me feel more comfortable with my purchase. Hopefully they will make additional apps available."}

I was pretty impressed with how easy it was to re-key, and wish that competitors would consider adding a feature like this. I have a Schlage Connect lock as well, and it cost an additional $13 to have re-keyed (not to mention the time and gas driving back and forth to a locksmith to avoid a $50 service charge.)\n\nFrom outside, the lock looks reasonably normal, though the interior mechanism is a bit large. You probably wouldn't want it on a decorative door, for instance.\n\nBasic functions worked, but not terribly well. I was expecting this to be more of a timesaver versus fishing for my keys, but in practice, it seemed to take a while for the lock to pair up with my phone and open. More often than not, it would have been faster to just find the key.\n\nBesides the lag in getting the lock to unlock, I also had some concerns about the exterior illumination. I don't think Kwikset locks are inherently insecure, but the glowing ring advertises the kind of lock you have to ne'er-do-wells. So, if someone was already familiar with how to defeat Kwikset locks, they'd save time looking for a house that has them.\n\nOverall, it's a fine lock and the price isn't crazy relative to competitors, but unless my house was all Kwikset, I think I'd recommend the Schlage Connect over this. It doesn't have the tap-to-enter feature, but using the keypad is consistently faster."}

The optional Kevo key fob accessory offers the same touch activated, proximity authorized entry convenience as the assigned eKeys do, available for those without their own compatible mobile device on which to store an eKey. Optionally, Kevo Plus, a one-time purchase of a handsomely-coordinated, \"home plate\" shaped gateway module, will maintain a connection with home Wi-Fi such that access and notifications may be performed remotely through an eKey authorized mobile device; I have yet to go Plus, but being free of subscription, it is exactly the type of thing I would go for, for the sake of completeness to such a technologically \"cool\" deadbolt system.\n\nI am spellbound by this particular advance in home improvement. The ring of LEDs is so futuristic looking. There are many distinguished messages animatedly performed by the many brightly colored LEDs, most commonly access granting, or denial if I forget to have my iPhone Bluetooth enabled. And, just as I do with my automobile's proximity key, I'm just as pleased with the amazing convenience of opening my lock with a touch.\n\nI easily performed installation by following the well illustrated and clearly animated instructions within the Kevo app. Hardware is included for a combination of different installation needs. A single harness combines the two cables that reach across previous generation Kevo locks, into a single, tidy cable for generation two. Initial setup concludes after installing the battery pack to assign its left or right handed orientation, and assigning the owner's mobile device as the administrator of the lock's assignable functions.\n\nI have not re-keyed my lock, though I did explore the few simple steps involved; the process is incredibly simple, making new physical key assignment convenient enough to do on a whim.\n\nUsing my Kevo is fun. My Kevo app has what I consider an intuitive interface. I'm still learning nuances of the lock itself, and I continue to test its sensitivity to nearby eKeys, but so far the lock is working beautifully. The app allows me to manage multiple locks, assign eKeys, perform software updates, and more. Navigation of the sensibly shallow menu hierarchy leads me exactly where I want to go every time.\n\nThe physical Kevo lock offers functional customization by means of four dip switches below its main program button. Switch one enables the interior status LED, switch two enables triple touch lock so that anyone can triple tap the door locked on their way out, switch three enables audible beeps, and switch four enables auto lock, which automatically locks thirty seconds after having been unlocked. The status LED and audible tones are enabled out of the box, the lock-centric functions must be selectively enabled by the lock's owner.\n\nThe Kwikset Kevo is such a simple yet beautifully advanced thing. It is your traditional deadbolt made magnitudes more versatile with Bluetooth-enabled proximity touch convenience, and optional remote connectivity through its optional Plus upgrade. Its interior and exterior hardware is equally as attractive as its dazzling LED displays are brilliant. I love it so far. I highly recommend the Kevo for individuals who do a lot of key management, for large and technologically connected families, or for individuals, such as myself, who not only marvels at well-implemented technology, but also likes to leave pointy metal keys at home when going out for a bicycle ride."}
{"Author": "jt", "Date": "on September 9, 2016", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Not Reliable Enough", "Text": "Original Title: Nice Technology and Makes Things Easier but, Squeezing Customer for Every Penny Annoying\n\nFirst off I must say that customer support for us Vine members is outstanding. I had some issues with the install which I will get to and customer service was outstanding about helping out and getting me what I needed. So, what was the problem? There are two sort of standard thickness doors you can have. Most exterior doors are 1-3/4 inches. I happen to have a 1-3/8 inch thick door. The Kevo I received was made for the 1-3/4 door so I needed to contact Kevo. I did and they were outstanding. Quick, responsive, helpful, and accommodating. They sent me out a replacement super quick. There is no mention of door thickness measurement anywhere on the box or on the website. I can't imagine I am the only person in this world that has a 1-3/8 door. Anyway, got the replacement lock that looks to just have a shorter tailpiece to accommodate the thinner door. Install wasn't that difficult except that I wish they would include a set of printed instructions. I know we are trying to be cool and hip and all Apple-like but having to use my phone to install the thing was ridiculous. I ended up printing out a set of instructions anyway. I did think that set up of the lock and phone and additional keys and a fob took quite a bit more effort than I thought it would. I think much of that would have been alleviated with a set of complete printed instructions that covered all those tasks. Instead I have to search their website for all the info I needed for the fob and best way too activate the lock and what all the light colors meant. Wasn't impossible bit was more than I thought it would be.\nAs for the lock itself, it takes a while to get used to. For one thing you have to have the Kevo app open in the foreground or background for the lock to work. For some reason the time it takes to respond or \"search\" and find you lock via Bluetooth can vary by a fairly significant amount of time. Sometimes it seems to respond very quickly and other times it takes so long or so many tries that you think it might be broken. In fact, there have been several times it took so long that I end up opening the app to make sure it was trying to connect and had not broken. The lock when opening or closing is quite loud. There is no sneaking through he door. The whole house knows when the lock is opening or closing. I also received a fob that I was really surprised does not come with the lock set. They sell them separately for about $25. That is really ridiculous! Come on! I thought there might be two of them included in the box. I think it is silly that they don't include at least one with the set and just ridiculous they cost as much as they do. The other thing they offer is this remote lock control subscription thing. Come on, you have to pay even more to get a feature that really just needs to securely go through your own wifi. Oh, and lets say you want or need more e-keys for other people living in the house with a smartphone. Well, that will cost you extra too.\nThe lock itself is nice when it works and makes getting in and out of my house more convenient. However, they are marketing this thing to \"nickel and dime\" people to get all the features that should really already be included.\n\nUpdate 9/22: The latest iOS10 iPhone update as really put some handcuffs on this lock. Now the Kevo app must be open on your phone for the touch lock to function. Keno says this is an \"Apple problem\" but I think it is really a Kevo problem that Kevo needs to fix. Now I have to take my phone out, unlock my phone, open the app, and then touch the lock. It would be easier to use an actual key... I took a star off until they fix this issue.\n\nUpdate 9/26: iOS 10.0.2 update seems to have \"fixed\" the problem of having to have the app open to work the lock.\n\nUpdate 3/11: Uninstalled. Thing is just too finicky. Occasionally it works. most of the time, it takes multiple tries for the bolt to lock or unlock. You end up standing in front of the door waiting when you could have just used a key and been in long ago. Often I have to take out my phone and open the app and unlock the door directly from the app screen. I leave the app open in the background all the time but it is so unreliable that we have started skipping locking the door all together. It was on the garage door so we just relied made sure we closed the garage door. Decided to remove the lock and go back to the old fashion key."}

The actions of the lock are also much faster and although it is just a few seconds, it makes a world of difference. Another plus on the new lock, is that is seems quite a bit quieter. The last lock (although it was great) was a bit loud, however, this one is noticeably, quite a bit quieter. Couldn't be happier !!! Installed one in my bosses place and he is over the moon. Walking three dogs and then trying to get keys out is a thing of the past. Touch the lock and life is good."}

{"Author": "Pierce Bradley", "Date": "on September 8, 2016", "Stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Hahahaha No More Keys", "Text": "To start, this is the first 'smart' lock I've owned, and so far I'm pretty impressed having installed it this morning.\n\nI have been wanting to get a smart lock for a while now, but as with most new tech, I like to wait for the 2nd generation as they typically iron out most of the kinks by then. I can't speak for the first generation Kevo, but what I can say is that this thing is pretty damn cool, and it works! Well most of the time it works. I'll outline my experience so far and update this review as I use it and try out more of the features like smart key configuration and scheduled ekeys. I also bought the Kevo plus hub today (you can only get it if you already own a Kevo 1st or 2nd gen) that allows remote monitoring and control of the lock over the internet and unlimited e-keys, so I'll be adding those details once it arrives.\n\nSummary (followed by detailed review)\n\nPros:\n- Easy to install with very clear and detailed instructions through the app\n- Easy to setup and update the lock and simple pairing through the Kevo app on iOS\n- It works, and does exactly what I was looking for - unlocks my door without having to dig for keys or my phone\n- Updates from Kwikset will ostensibly fix whatever bugs arise after the product launches and more people start using Kevo 2\n- Kevo app is actually pretty decent - stable operation, slick user interface, and very easy to use\n\nCons:\n- Occasionally doesn't work unless paired phone is very close to the lock, but only sometimes and no discernible pattern yet\n- Key fobs are nearly worthless as they must be held within 5-6 inches to actually get the Kevo to unlock\n- Remote monitoring and control requires you to buy the optional $100 Kevo Plus - would be nice to just have this feature in the lock itself\n- Auto-lock is not adjustable and only gives you the option to automatically re-lock 30 seconds after unlocking, I'd prefer a minute or two\n- eKeys cost $1.99 a piece unless you buy Kevo Plus and they only give you 2 (1 for you and one for someone else)\n\nInstallation: 5 stars\n\nSuper easy installation only took about 15 minutes to get it installed from start to finish. My front door is pretty standard and already had a Kwikset deadbolt installed, so it was really no trouble whatsoever to swap it out with the Kevo 2nd gen lock. The installation instructions are provided via the Kevo app, and you can either download a pdf outlining all of the steps, or follow an interactive/animated tutorial that walks you through the process step by step, allowing you to choose the instructions relevant to your door. For example, at different stages of installation the app provides choices for variables like the diameter of the hole in your door, door thickness, whether the pin is centered when the bolt mechanism is first placed in the door, or whether you want to be able to access the controls switches without removing the cover plate entirely. Each option tree will instruct you clearly how to proceed with the install, and what components included in the Kevo 2 package you'll need. There are a number of extra bits of hardware that will allow you to install this lock on pretty much any door it seems, and again, I can't stress how simple they made the process.\n\nSetup and Pairing: 5 stars\n\nAgain, super easy. At the end of the physical install, you simply open the Kevo app, press the program button on the back of the lock panel and hold your phone next to the lock - that's it. No calibrating or fussing with settings, it literally took 10 seconds to pair the lock with my phone and start using the lock. Everything worked beautifully and I cheered when I saw the deadbolt extend and retract into the door with just a touch - this is definitely the future. The Kevo app informed me that there was a software update available for the lock which took about 15 minutes to complete, during which my phone just had to be within 20 ft or so of the lock. It's reassuring that they can update the locks software/firmware remotely, and I expect any glitches will be ironed out over time by Kwikset via such updates. Sending eKeys is also incredibly easy and is done in the Kevo app, which accesses your contacts directly and allows you to distribute keys to whomever you want. My wife got access in no time, and had no trouble getting the lock to work with her phone. The only complaint I have is with the optional key fobs also sold by Kwikset which I will discuss later.\n\nFunction: 4 stars\n\nIt works, and having used it between 15-20 times between me and my wife today, we have had no problem getting the Kevo 2 to unlock. Eventually. Not always on the first try, but always by the 2nd (or at most 3rd) attempt, the ring will spin green and the deadbolt will unlock. It's a little unnerving to stand outside and see the ring turn red or just go black, which happens roughly 1/3 of the time in my experience. I'm not sure why this is happening, but it seems that distance may be one part of the issue as I've never had a problem opening it if my phone is placed directly in front of the lock. Don't get me wrong, it still works if my phone is in my pocket or backpack, but it doesn't seem to be as reliable in those circumstances. I uploaded a video demonstrating this issue. In it, I am filming with my phone which at first is a little bit away from the lock and I can't get it to open, then when I bring the phone closer, it works. I'll keep testing this and see if I can't find a predictable pattern or explanation, but in the meantime, it's not really a problem that would prevent me from buying this lock again. Also, the lock comes with keys in case you might be worried about being locked out due to technical difficulties or if your phone battery dies and I would recommend putting them on your keychain just in case something like that happens.\n\n*Note about key fobs - I also bought 2 optional Kwikset key fobs and paired them with my lock, and so far I'm unimpressed. They pair easily, but are really spotty when it comes to opening the door on their own, especially if you have them anywhere but in your hand within 1 foot of the Kevo. I tested them with my phone's bluetooth turned off, and while they will get it to unlock occasionally from my pocket, too often I have to dig out my keys and put the fob directly in front of the Kevo to work. This defeats the purpose of having a fob in the first place and I'm really disappointed so far in this product. Maybe there's a battery issue or something I'm missing with these, but as of right now I have to say you're better off saving that money until they come out with a better product.\n\nTBD\n- Scheduled or expiring eKeys\n- Kevo Plus integration\n- Battery life\n- Updates addressing unforeseen bugs/glitches"}

Now thanks to the folks at Kevo we have the opportunity to use the 2nd Generation of it. Yes! A new Kevo was given to us to try :>)\n1.It has a smaller footprint on the door.\n2.The Bluetooth seems to work from further away. We touch it on the go and can here it lock from the end of the driveway, a good 30 feet away. As the documents say your device must be on the outside of the door for it to lock or unlock for security, it will not unlock if someone touches it and your device is on the inside. We also received Kevo Plus Bluetooth gateway, it lets you check the lock from anywhere when connected to your wireless router and lock from an APP. Gives you an added confidence to know it is locked without having to go back home to check it.\n3.It seems to have more power. It doesn\u2019t hesitate when it locks like the 1st Gen, and it is smoother when you lock it manually.\nOur son (as I said in our first review of the 1st Generation) has problems with keys and remembering codes. He needs to let himself inside the house at times. Before he would be sitting outside because he could not remember how to unlock the door. He is Intellectually Delayed and wants to be independent. We have tried several other types of keyless locks, some with push buttons with and without batteries. The Kevo came out and we went shopping. Right off he loved it and so did we, at the time it only worked with Apple but also the Key fob, No internet connection. Our son always has a BIG smile on his face every time he uses it and will run you over to get to lock or unlock it before you can. Now it works with Apple, Android, the Kevo Key Fob, plus with the Bluetooth gateway so you can check your lock from anywhere. Oh! You can also use a key which with the SmartKey you can re-key the lock yourself to any key you like quickly.\nOur son can open the door by just touching the lock and thinks he has a magic finger, nose or elbow! And this really makes him happy. It makes us happy to see him more independent and secure!"}

I installed this in the house we just bought. I thought this was a GREAT idea, however, the technology is clunky, to the point of being more of a pain than it is worth.\n\nFirst, it takes too long or fails to connect with your phone or key. This thing works by connecting to your phone or a key fob by bluetooth or RFID. The point of buying this was I wanted to just unlock the door without fishing my keys out of my pocket. You know, your holding groceries, don't want to put them down to fish out keys, don't want to balance them to fish out keys, wouldn't it be nice if you could just tap the lock... What happens when you tap the lock and it doesn't find the key or phone in your pocket 12 inches away? How about when you are standing there, tap the lock, and it takes 7 seconds to find the key/phone? I could have fished my keys out in the same amount of time. The technology is just too unreliable to actually fulfill the intended function\n\nSecond, it misfires, A LOT! Such irony... When you want it to open, it wont. When you don't want it to open, it will. Walk in the door, sure I didn't touch the lock to activate the automatic feature, and as the door is swinging closed the bolt shoots out and the bolt wacks the door frame. LOVELY! My door frame is now damaged because of this happening over and over again. I've attached a picture.\n\nThis thing is a great idea, but the technology is completely unreliable. If you buy this, you'll be sitting at your front door, staring at the blue lights, having it fail to work over and over again, and you'll feel like a complete fool for buying it."}

I am an even bigger fan of the second gen Kevo. I now have my whole house secured with a Kiwkset Kevo at all entrances. I have three of the first gen and my first second gen. So far (its been 2-3 weeks) the new second gen has worked 100% of the time and opened on the first touch every time. It's very stylish and is very easy to install if you are swapping out an existing deadbolt for a Kevo. Including programming and an iPhone app update, it took me 15 minutes to swap it out for an existing deadbolt.\n\nI love the quiet movement of the mechanism on the second gen. It's so very smooth and secure based on my experience and so much quieter than the first generation. I've used Kevo locks since they first came out and am very happy with the product. I know it is pricier than other locks, but it's such a convenience to leave the big keychain and keys at home, it's durable and secure, so it's well worth the price for me personally. The first gens I installed two years ago look like they were just installed out of the box yesterday despite the Midwest winters and summer direct sunlight. The second gen quality and style lives up to its predecessor, so I know I will continue to be pleased and a Kevo owner for life."}

{"Author": "Dave Lakhani", "Date": "on September 6, 2016", "Stars": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Not Ready For Prime Time And By The Time You Buy Everything That Is Extra To Make It Work You Could Have Purchased Better", "Text": " I really wanted to love this lock, I've used a lot of Kwikset equipment in my houses over the year and feel very positively about the brand overall but this lock isn't ready.\n\nIt is important to note that this is a bluetooth lock NOT a wireless lock (it can be for an additional $99, more on that in a minute), what that means is that you must have blue tooth on when you want to use it and it does chew up battery when you have it on. You can get a fob for an additional $25, which I received free for being a reviewer. Before I get a lot of comments on this review, I understand that the function of this lock is a touch to open blue tooth lock not a wireless network lock ... but, they do upsell to that functionality as a key function of the installation and the app so it definitely factors into consideration for the review.\n\nThe lock is big, it takes up a lot of space on the inside of your door, it is reminiscent of an old hotel door lock and it isn't that aesthetically pleasing.\n\nAll that said, the lock is quick and easy to install though it was missing one bag of screws in the lock I received, the two screws that hold the interior locking device to the supplied door hardware. It was a pain to find screws short enough at a hardware store but I didn't want to wait several days and have to uninstall everything and replace my old lock. The videos in the app for how to install the lock are very clear and easy to understand which makes installation a breeze. I would have appreciated paper instructions as well simply because it would be faster than running through multiple videos but I appreciate that they are making it dead simple.\n\nOnce the lock is installed, it works generally pretty well. I cycled the lock from different distances 100 times after I installed it over a period of three hours. About 40% of the time, no matter how close or far away I was it couldn't find the lock and gave me an error saying I was too far away in the app. About 10% of the time when touching to unlock the lock the lock didn't respond to the first touch. It didn't matter if my phone was in my pocket or right next to the lock. The same was true of the fob though it happened slightly less. The good news is that it comes with a key so even if you have total failure you can still open the lock.\n\nAnother issue that I noticed was that the lock did not always fully cycle the bolt about 1 out of 10 times so you couldn't open the door without re-locking the lock and cycling again. On two occasions I had to do that two times in a row to get it to fully retract the bolt.\n\nWhen the lock works, it works quickly and easily. The action is smooth, not too loud and the lights on the front of the lock give you instant feedback about exactly what the lock is doing. I can usually unlock the lock from 20 to 30 feet away reliably (within the range above) and get the same effectiveness up close.\n\nProgramming the lock and pairing the phone is very simple. Sending a key (It comes with two keys, after that you have to purchase additional keys for $1.99 each). And, you can give guest keys with 24 hour access for free. This is handy but if you have guest staying multiple days you either have to buy another key or give them a new key every 24 hours.\n\nAll that brings me to the cost/value of the lock. At $229, the lock is a decent value for this level of device until you begin paying for all the add ons. So far this is what I've discovered.\n\nAdditional key $1.99\nKey Fob $25\nKeno Plus so you can lock or unlock remotely $99 (one time fee) - I can't really evaluate the effectiveness of the Kevo Plus portion of the lock as it was not given as part of the review. I requested it so I could do a full review of the lock but the seller wasn't offering it for review at this time. That said, this lock is no faster than using a key with the misfires you experience when using it which is the biggest reason for giving it 3 stars. By the time you add a key fob and Kevo Plus you could have purchased other locks that are far more effective and higher rated. So to achieve full function, you will spend in excess of $350. I was a little miffed that I had to pay $1.99 to get an extra electronic key for the lock, this is a premium lock, there should at minimum be enough keys for an average household. This is taking the old manual lock idea and moving it forward to an in app purchase rather than just giving you at least four keys and not making you pay $1.99 for every key beyond two. Just my opinion, but I wouldn't be happy if I had paid full price for the lock only to be nickel and dimed for keys.\n\nI haven't decided if I will buy Kevo Plus, I may at some point in the future. If I do, I will update the review to reflect my experience with that product as well.\n\nOne other thing I wasn't crazy about is that if you are in bluetooth range ANYONE who touches the lock can open the door, not a huge deal because you are typically within eyesight of the door if it will unlock but it would also work if you were inside the house and someone walked up while you were within range and touched the lock.\n\nOverall, I like the lock well enough but wish it was more reliable in terms of working each time you tap the screen or touch the lock. I think that this lock will continue to improve in functionality over time but it needs to work better than it does today to be another more than average and a good idea."}

Externally it doesn't draw any attention as a \"smart lock\" until you see it activate to lock or unlock. Inside the new housing is both more compact and a bit cleaner. I have no complaints about fitment or tolerances... you may have to do a little tweaking to get the toggle actuation buttery smooth but I did not find it any more difficult than other motorized locks. It is incredibly intuitive to use the lock and send / use keys. Sometimes the proximity sensor detects my dog inside and requires me to tap the lock an extra time or two, but I prefer the sensitivity to prevent would-be intruders from getting inside versus ignoring my dog more often.\n\nReally my only complaint lies with the Android mobile app. Kiwkset says they are \"verifying compatibility\" with additional devices... whatever that means. I don't have an approved device (Moto X Pure XT1575) but sideloaded the latest version of the app, and as expected with an Android device with a sufficiently recent version of the OS with the necessary APIs ... everything worked perfectly out of the box. Due to Kwikset's Android app policy I would be totally unable to use my phone with this lock if Android didn't make it so easy to sideload APKs. This is not something they can or should expect customers to do.\n\nKwikset needs to empower their Android developers to mark the app as compatible for more devices. The default should be to mark the API level as compatible and blacklist / note incompatible devices where manufacturers poorly implemented their device support. At a minimum offer a less restrictive beta channel for people to sign up for. Your developers have got to be frustrated and you are throwing away customers!"}

I found Gen 1 super simple to install as it easily replaced the existing deadbolt. It took me approximately 15 minutes. Gen 2 was just as easy to get into place. I did over tighten the main bolts which initially caused the actuator mechanism to bind. Not having had that issue with Gen 1, I called support and got superb (and patient) customer service. We had it working in relative no time.\n\nAs for the Kevo Gen 2 device, I love it. It is simple to use but also has helpful features like scheduling eKey access.That's useful if there are members of your household that need boundaries. For those of you who are sensitive to security issues, the lock itself on the door looks like any other. I considered a lock with a keypad but thought better because to me that only invited unwarranted attention in my context.\n\nAs a Kevo Plus user, it is comforting to know that my ability to engage the lock isn't limited to bluetooth range.

{"Author": "Amazon Customer", "Date": "on September 4, 2016", "Stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Nice design but flaws", "Text": "So recently purchased the Kevo 2nd generation along with two key FOB's. I will admit was easy to install. Only hiccup for me was the deadbolt was a little tight, but that was the door frame a little chisel of the wood and dead bolt worked fine. Setting up two phones with the app went easy and the setup of the FOB's went easy. Did not take long and directions are good. A little disappointed that one has to upgrade the app for Kevo to lock or unlock door you need to purchase the upgrade for another $99 (granted I was thinking about it). But for $300 to $400 this lock needs to be super smart. Side note like the sleek design.\n\nEnjoyed the history log of when locked and unlocked, but only the phones recorded that. With kids and a FOB would be nice to see in the logs when the FOB's were used. So for instance FOB 1 could be one of my kids and FOB 2 could be my second kid. So then I would know when they were home. The phones seem to record that log would be nice to have the FOBs especially at the $300 I paid for the dead bolt and 2 key FOB's. Also the log for the FOB's would be nice to see in the log file it was paired up. So scenario could be I let a person in to clean my house they get a new FOB and could program FOB without me knowing (log file is nice and displays the phones the FOB's should do the same).\n\nSecond major issue was with all the FOB's in the house and the two smartphones in the house I went outside to see if I could get in by just touching the kwikset. This is where I was disappointed; it actually let me in several times. A few scenarios I had the boys walk to the door stand about two feet from the door inside and it let me in. Another scenario was my wife was on the couch in the front room about 5 feet away and I still got in. Granted sometimes it took me touching the set about 12 times and sometimes it only took one or three times to touch to get in. We tried with just one FOB near the door and one phone by the door granted still 1 to 2 feet away. Major safety issue strangers in my house and my kids did not feel safe. Total test time I spent 4 hours trying to figure out if it was a phone or the FOB's. The phones seemed to let us in easier. Definitely could not distinguish between inside my house and outside.\n\nSo we tried a factory restore and seemed to work a little better only did one phone and the FOB's for the setup. Works fine entering and leaving, but once again when all the units are inside would let me in with nothing outside. Needless to say I'm returning the product. Perhaps being the 2nd generation there is a few bugs, but at the cost consumers need to have it function flawlessly. I went with just a kwikset smartcode 913.\n\nPerhaps could have tried another system, but not at that cost and frustration."}

{"Author": "William Hefner", "Date": "on September 3, 2016", "Stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A Funny Thing Happened...", "Text": "I must say that this is one of the most frustrating products that I have ever attempted to use. Pretty much every step to get it installed was a long, drawn-out nightmare. The product's only saving grace is that once it is installed it pretty much works. I could write a short novel about getting this thing installed, but I'll try to keep this review as brief as humanly possible.\n\nIt all starts on Day #1. I get the Kevo in the mail from amazon.com. It looks attractive and I am ready to do the install. I go to Android Store to install the app and am told that my Samsung Galaxy S4 is not supported by the KEVO app. So much for using it with my phone. So, I figure that I will will just install the lock to work with the keyfob. There's no keyfob included in the package though. Just a note saying that I have to e-mail the company to request one. I do. Three days later, I finally get a reply. It will be here tomorrow.\n\nDay 4. The keyfob arrives! I start reading the instructions only to find out that I HAVE to have the phone app installed on my phone to install the lock because a set of written installation instructions are not included. So, I am essentially dead in the water.\n\nDay 5. By pure chance I happen to have ordered an Android-based multimedia gizmo that has the latest version of Android on it, as well as Bluetooth. I navigate to the Android store and sure enough, I am able to install the KEVO app with the interactive, online installation manual! On Day 6 I set out to actually install the lock. I start the KEVO app, fill-out the online registration form and get just far enough in the interactive instructions to where a video is supposed to be displayed. None of the videos from YouTube will load though. I am told that I may need to restart my device. This required me repeating the installation procedures several times until I determined that YouTube wasn't playing nice with the built-in web browser. I switch default browsers and am finally able to watch the videos. The hardware is now fully installed! I just need to electronically \"register\" the device now. However, when I get to that step I am told that my device is not compatible with that feature. So, after all that work, I am basically stuck with an old-fashioned lock and key. I open the instructions that came with the keyfob to see if I can now get that to work.\n\nThe keyfob instructions are very limited, but I finally am able to pair the fob with the lock. It works! The last step in the fob instructions tell me that I have to use the interactive app to go through the calibration process. Unfortunately, that doesn't work on my device, either. Inside the app is an option to download the full installation manual though. I thoroughly go through the 11 page installation manual only to find that there is NO mention whatsoever of any calibration process or how to perform it. I am basically just told that I need to use the app, which does me no good.\n\nI then remembered that I had registered the product when going through the KEVO app, so I use my web browser to stroll over to the company's website and log-in using the password I had created when going through the app. My account is registered, but when I try to go anywhere on the site I am told, \"You need a KEVO to use that feature\". Since the only way to register on the site is through the KEVO app, I would think it pretty obvious that I have a KEVO. Literally, the only option I am allowed to access is the ability to pay more money for a KEVO Plus subscription.\n\nSo, for now the lock seems to work. I have no idea how to calibrate the device though and I'm not sure if it makes any difference because there is nothing in the freakin' manual about it. Suffice to say, I am pretty skeptical about how reliable the keyfob is. So, I'm basically just using it as a \"dumb\" lock and carrying around a regular key just in case. Quite frankly, I actually feel less safe now that the thing is installed, not knowing if the thing is installed properly or not. There is no other documentation that I can access, so I am pretty much just left holding my breath hoping that the thing doesn't eventually go haywire on me. Oh, I almost forgot... Registering using the KEVO app automatically puts you on four different mailing lists from the manufacturer that you must manually opt-out of if you don't want them spamming you. I should have just propped up a chair against the door, instead.\n\nUPDATE: It's only been roughly 24 hours since I wrote my initial review and the keyfob is already failing. It took me 5 tries to unlock my door with the keyfob this afternoon and it only worked after I held my keyring and keyfob directly against the lock. It would not work at all when I had the keys in my pocket standing 6\" from the door. Screw it. I am just going to start using the regular key from now on.\n\nUPDATE #2: I have had the product for several weeks now. It is still hit-and-miss when it comes to the keyfob opening the lock. I always have to hold it up directly to the lock to open it. Oddly, it seems to have a much greater range when it comes to locking the door. In fact, if I am carrying my keyfob in my pocket about 1 time in 10 the door will lock behind me when I go outside, though I have not programmed it to do so. My best guess is that I am accidentally brushing against the lock when I close the door behind me, This means that I am accidentally locking myself out of my house once every few days. The good news is, this only happens when I have the keyfob with me, so I am always able to get back in. It is just really annoying."}

The application is fairly easy to use and setup. I didn't use the first generation lock so I can't compare its performance, but so far this generation seems solid and well thought-out. I do think the back plate seems overly large and bulky, although the company says it's smaller than the previous generation. I do wish it shipped with at least one fob, however, since the Android support is *very* limited."}

Rubinstein", "Date": "on September 1, 2016", "Stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "BEST LOCK EVER!!!", "Text": "I have owned the original Kevo 1st Generation lock for over two years now, and I absolutely LOVE it! It works FLAWLESSLY with both my iPhone 6S+ and the Bluetooth Key Fob it came with so well, that in two year's time, I have never had a need to use the key at all!\nJust when I thought it couldn't get any better... along came the Kevo 2nd Generation lock. I managed to acquire one and replaced my original Kevo with this one. The installation and instructions were flawless, simple, and quick. I had it in within 20 minutes!\nSetup through the Kevo App was a breeze. I had it up and running within 10 minutes (a firmware update was required). The programming feature is now automatic, so you don't have to go through the motions to pair it to the phone or Key Fobs like the original Kevo 1st Gen. I had everything paired within 5 minutes! Needless to say, this Kevo 2nd Gen works EVEN BETTER than the 1st Gen!\nThe range is far better, and it automatically calibrates the distance from you and the lock using your Smart Phone or Key Fob for 100% functionality. The locking mechanism is significantly FASTER and QUIETER than 1st Gen, and after testing it out for several weeks... opening and closing the lock HUNDREDS of times, I found that it is 99.9% accurate. The Bluetooth range is significantly greater than 1st Gen, as I can now remotely open and close the lock using my phone from ANYWHERE inside of my apartment, whereas with 1st Gen Kevo, I had to be within 15 feet in order for it to work.\nThe lighting pattern on the outside cylinder is slightly different than 1st Gen Kevo, but it is a more logical series of green and amber lights which react instantly to the open/close command. The interior footprint of the lock housing is smaller than 1st Gen Kevo, and comes with 3 security screws which attach the cover securely to prevent unauthorized tampering with the lock.\nThe 2nd Gen Kevo comes with 2 microprocessors, whereas the 1st Gen Kevo had one... making this significantly \"smarter\" and more powerful than it predecessor. Future firmware and software updates will make the lock even more versatile down the road.\nIf you are in the market for a \"touch entry lock\"... KEVO 2nd GEN is definitely the way to go. Built to last for years, it comes in several attractive finishes, possesses superior functionality, is backed by the manufacturer's excellent warranty, and is an overall absolute PLEASURE TO USE... I guarantee that you will absolutely LOVE this product the way that I do! It has taken the \"chore\" out of putting packages down and fumbling with keys. In addition, the likeliness of LOSING your keys is far greater than losing your smart phone, which is the \"key\" to the lock!\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND this lock to everyone looking to simplify their lives and graduate into the next generation of \"smart home features\". I am 110% satisfied with this product! I KNOW that you will be too!"}

The generation 2 Kevo has a smaller footprint and a sleeker look to the inside module. Also the second generation Kevo is less sensitive to the touch so no more door locking behind you when you quickly run out the door and graze the lock with your arm. The locking motor also seems to be more powerful (but that's just an observation). I couldn't be more happy with this lock. Keep your phone (and your keys) in your pocket. Just one finger touch to the deadbolt and you are in. Kevo Generation 2 does not disappoint.\n\nInstallation took less then 20 minutes. The app really walks you through the installation. There is only one wire to connect. Could not be easier."}

While I enjoyed using the 1st Generation Kevo, this lock has a more solid build, a cleaner look and just plain sounds better when it opens and closes. An improvement on an already solid product. I would, however, highly recommend bringing in someone with experience to install the lock as it's not something your typical consumer will easily grasp. It's a small issue but one worth noting. Bravo Kwikset for your continued efforts and here's hoping you'll integrate with Apple's home kit in the near future."}

The customer supported insisted that the only way to buy this was from Kwikset directly. I had to have them validate the Amazon storefront to tell me that all I had to do is open the Kevo app and go to options in the upper left and setup the gateway. It really is fantastic. I am so glad this is being sold here on Amazon where it arrives as expected every time at my home."}
