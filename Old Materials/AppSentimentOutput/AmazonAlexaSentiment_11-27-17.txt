App:  Alexa 

Alexa will be better when all the skills are auto enabled. Each skill should have a casual wake up sentence. For example, if I want Alexa to search a recipe, she cannot do! I should tell the skill's name and exact command of the skill to perform the required action. As an average human, I cannot remember more that 10 specific messages of the skills!

b"Works okay most of the time but I don't know whether its due to an update or not but now I can't activate any smart home skills! As I authorize the skill either on a web browser or on my mobile it just returns to the main Alexa screen and the skill isn't active! I have previously connected Lifx successfully but I unlinked the Lifx skill and relinked it to test whether it was other skills that were the problem and not the Alexa app. Now I can't activate the Lifx skill anymore! So its defiantly the Alexa app ??"

Incredibly slow, I assume it goes back to Amazon's servers for EVERY little thing.  This app really hurts my perception of my Echo and Tap which are likewise really slow for what I assume is the same reason.  Why on earth can't the app talk directly to the device sitting 3 feet away on the same WiFi &amp; Bluetooth networks? Also, NO, I'm not giving it access to my contacts, no matter how much it nags me.  Wish I didn't have the app, the Echo, or the Tap.

This app works very well with both of my Echos. I use it constantly, but I just wish for 2 things...  1) I could set the home page to be what I want instead of it going immediately to conversations. I don't drop in on my friends, we text.  2) I wish there were widgets that went along with it, for example, I wish I put a shortcut to my shopping list on my home page.

I hate this app. If you want to use your amazon music account it takes you to a cut down interface of the regular amazon music app that's unnecessarily difficult to navigate.  The app is slow to load and somewhat buggy on my phone.  I literally canceled my Amazon music unlimited subscription and picked up a spotify subscription, since spotify lets you continue streaming on echo/desktop/etc. This way i can avoid this app almost entirely.  Don't get me wrong i love Amazon products and Amazon echo but i just can't stand this app.

This app sucks. Very minimal and outdated interface. Music Player has very basic functions. Multiple files selection not available. My device has become more of a toy than a functional interface.

This app is so bad that the for Echo dots I just purchased I had no choice but to return. They are finally available in Canada but I cannot get any of them to work. The app always says I need to change my country and to press next to change it then you press next and it just goes back to the homepage of the app. Try to add a smarthome device and constant error saying my country is incorrect and that I need to change it by pressing next which never works. I keep picking Canada as my region I press save and then it shows United States again and says my country needs to be set to Canada for it to work. I don't have enough time to waste with this.

They broke smart home capabilities with this update. I had to replace a light and now Alexa has it twice.  It did not forget devices anymore.

We're still far away from mastering this future tech. It works some times and even less with other "alexa enabled" devices. I had to buy a range extender just to use it in my bedroom, still debating if it was worth it. My latest issue is I cannot write a review for Alexa skills without it being blocked by my keyboard, and it always refreshes whenever I leave the app. I'm also having an issue with duplicate smarthome devices appearing and changing the names doesn't work at all. This thing is useless.

There are various problems that need working. Top most of which is that it doesn't recognise the song name even though it's available on Saavn. There should be a feature wherein I can directly play songs from Saavn (on my phone) on the speaker.

Was very slow and basic.  Only used it when Alexa disconnected from internet or maybe to add a skill. After Updating it last week I keep opening the app and all I get is a blank white screen and a message not optimized for your device. I have a new galaxy tab E. Every other app works flawlessly. No way to go to previous version of the app. Why would you send an update notification to a tablet it is not optimized for:( Still after all this time I get a blank white screen.

It amazed me that Amazon scraped by for years with a barely working, sorry excuse for an app, only now deciding it was time for a change. I was actually happy to see this reskin, hoping they'd finally addressed the horrible performance issues. I was optimistic, only to find out it's just that - a reskin. The app is still as slow and unresponsive than it ever was. Plus, Amazon shoehorned this stupid "calling" feature that I do not want my Echo to have, and I have no way to disable it or opt out. This app is garbage, and the Echo is slowly turning into a paperweight. Won't be long until I give up on it altogether.

Before the update this was intuitive and easy to navigate, a real joy to use.   After the update it's a pain to work with and so sloooow to start up and to top it off some of the skills don't work anymore.  The Smart home shows devices multiple times, disabling the skills for the bridges does nothing to remove them. Even uninstalled and reinstalled the app does nothing to remove them. Some groups do not work no matter if you include the duplicate devices.   I dread going into the app now well done Amazon NOT!

I am extremely happy with the echoes, my rating is for the app, not the actual devices.  The app is very laggy.  At a minimum, you should be able to delete old smart devices from the list, not just disable them.  Also, you should be able to put an echo in more than one Multiroom Group.  IE:Livingroom Echo would be in the downstairs network but should also be allowed to be in the Whole House network.  It's very wishy washy on giving commands to lights and doesn't always work when I ask Alexa to play music on a Multiroom Group.  It will play on one of the echoes but not all of the ones assigned.  The app should be more capable of performing all of the possible tasks that the echo is programmed to do.

I tried to play song besabriyan it played something else. But I would like to see few things for eg in alarm section Alexa say by herself to get up.. Rather alarm tone and then play some music.. Second on routine it should add music section and most importantly to do list and reminders section... And some of my own  recorded notes to play for eg affirmations. Also I want something to be remembered by her not as reminder but as memory so that when every i say Alexa how much gms in one scoop.. It should answer it from the memory i gave her..

Started out great...   Is nothing but trouble now.  Alexa no longer can control any of the smart plugs I have... (15 of 'em)  ...was working wonderfully for weeks...  But last week all the smartplugs became "unresponsive" (according to Alexa), disabling and re-enabling the skill has fixed this issue in the past, but no longer... Alexa can find them, but not control them... So now I have to reach down to where these lights are plugged in to turn them off and on now... (Or, find the phone, load the app for the smartplugs, and turn them on/off from there)   ... The -Alexa- app still says they are "unresponsive"....  Investing in Alexa was a mistake.  A very expensive one.  Lesson learned.

If I could give this app a negative review I would. I'm not a huge fan of my dot to begin with but the app just destroys any positive feelings I might have had.   One of the biggest things I use the app for is text to speech on my Kindle books. Not only can I not arrange how I want the icons to look or hide services I don't use, but I can't   search through my books for the title I want or sort them. It is also virtually impossible to just say "Alexa read XXXXX" because she has no idea what I'm talking about.  My roommate foumd the same thing when she tried to get the app to read to her. You have to dig through all the books to find the one you want and then hit play.   Also, Alexa is extremely  spotty with pronunciation (i.e., a character whose name is Manny sometimes gets called Man, sometimes pronounced Many and sometimes pronounced Manny; a character named Colin is sometimes prounced like Cawlin and sometimes like Colon).  All that being said, the biggest thing I hate about the app is that it randomly stops, as if a sleep timer went off and it stops reading. If I wake her up by saying "Alexa", she reads a few more words and then stops or she will randomly start reading again (i.e., a 3 am the book will come back on for a sentence or two and then will stop again). This would continue the whole book if I let it. Amazon says it's most likely the internet connection but I can tell you it absolutely is not.   I realize Alexa was a pioneer in AI in her early days, but one would think Amazon would have improved her since then. Not so much.

Ok, I have to say Alexa is just awesome!  With the addition of "Routines", which allow me to setup home automation macros, I have to say this app is now incredible.   Wow!  Also, over the last year, Alexa's ability to answer questions has improved so much, she's now about equal to Google, which is a tremendous improvement.  I have a Google Home Mini only for questions, since Amazon Echo is so far ahead of Google Home for home automation capabilities, but I've figured out Alexa can now answer just about everything Google can. I am NOT a fan of the Alexa calling features, since I have no intention of opening all my contacts up to Amazon, but Alexa is now close to perfect. We'll done Amazon!

The Alexa does nothing that was advertised when I bought it. It can, if you buy various descriptions, but that was not shown in the ads, and should have been included in the purchase price, as implied by Alexa's advertising. For the exorbitant overpriced purchase I made, I basically have an ugly paperweight that tells me the weather. Alexa does not play music for me, not even my YouTube playlist, does not turn on and off my lights, or do any of the features shown in its television marketing.

Very very slow......and now I've got no skills or music....I spend nore time speaking to  Amazon than i do the wife.....I'm getting fed up of talking to Amazon....way too big to be excellent....   ORIGINAL: This reviewew is Only on the Echo.....not the "echo dots as they are VERY POOR"...the Echo is Better than when it started. It really needs phone linking. To rival Google.....good sound. Great at understanding. I've had the echo since it was pre order.  So good I ordered 2 dots they have never got better at anything....what a waste of money. I've just pre orderd a new echo. Second gen.....UPDATE it got delivered to someone else, no delivery card....what a going on...they had to send another, one. Its here, it's as good as the Original although it's not working at the moment. None of the skills or music. On the whole house and we have 4 in total..... You need a voice like Pavarotti to get the dots to work  I think the dots would work well in space....just floating.........heading towards the sun. Be way more entertaining!! If they were captured by the Borg, they wouldn't be able to do anything with them....

Fourth Update:  Amazon/Alexa did allow this station back on-line, so all is well, for now.  No complaints at this time.  Great service, and great device (I have the Tap).  So 5 Stars.  Hope it stays this way.  ////  Update:  Wow!  So now we're purging conservative radio stations from the Amazon/Alexa feed, huh?  I tried to ask Alexa to play my favorite radio station, and I got back "105.9 FM WMAL on iHeart Radio isn't available right now."  Just to make sure it wasn't a temporary glitch, I waited and asked again, and got the same, only restated: "105.9 FM WMAL on iHeart Radio is currently not available."  Which is funny (NOT), 'cause I can go straight to iHeart Radio on my Android tablet, and it immediately plays, just fine.  Amazon, you had better stop boycotting/purging stations just 'cause you don't like their content!  Not happy at all with Amazon over this.  Fix now!  Immediately!  Or you will be reported to the FCC!  ////  Second Update:  Finally, Landscape Mode has been restored!!  Thank you, Amazon, for providing this update for all of us tablet owners, and for the disabled who rely on Landscape Mode for their special devices.  As I said before, this has always been a 5 Star application.  Brilliantly thought out.  Superbly executed.  Great UI.  Now that it supports tablets, it is perfect.  Thanks again, Amazon!  BVI User.  ////  First Update: After calling and emailing Amazon, Landscape Mode has still not been restored for their handicapped/disabled users.  Numerous reviews have been posted by other handicapped/disabled people asking why, and no response from Amazon.  Poor customer response and service.  So, down to One Star you go.  What a shame, for an otherwise responsible and squared-away company.  Pay attention to your handicapped/disabled users!  ////  This would have been a 5 Star review...  Until yesterday.  Minus One Star for taking away Landscape Mode.  Hey, some of out here have large screen tablets and are not gonna twist them around just to see your app's screen.  Those of us with Visual Impairments need the widescreen display.  Please make the orientation an option, Landscape or Portrait.  Minus One Star for removing the identifying colors and symbols for our music apps.  Again, those of us with Visual Impairments used to be able to find our iHeartRadio app by looking for the "red square."  The TuneIn Radio app was easily located by looking for the "aqua square."  Granted, I'm sure that the black &amp; white menus look very modern and sophisticated, but they're not friendly for the Visually Impaired.  Please add an option to put the color back.  Otherwise, great app!  I can control my Tap from either my tablet or new iPhone seamlessly.  Just please be considerate of us Visually Impaired people.  Thanks.  5 Stars once you provide these options.  BVI user.

I just would like to play music I like every day from a certain time. First there is no such routine setup option in this app. Second the music selection on Unlimited Prime is actually very limited. No way to customize the list. No search. Just a preconfigured set like fast-food.

Otherwise it will be paid back in an undesirable manner.

Buggy, my biggest issue is all alarms I have ever set, including duplicates, are in a giant list. It takes 20 seconds to be able to start scrolling and 10 seconds when getting to enable one of these because the list gets refreshed.

It works okay, but there's a major issue with a cookie bug.  If you're logged in to Amazon in another Amazon app (Amazon Shopping, etc) most of the time the Amazon Alexa app will not open. Instead, it just sits there with the loading icon spinning.  The fix (until the programmers eliminate the bug), which took me forever to find online, is to open other Amazon apps, logout of Amazon, then open Alexa.

Can't do a manual search for songs on this app. This is a basic thing that is needed as voice searcing often has to be too exact to find the right song and looking through a genre isn't a fast way to find a song. Also the the lag makes the app almost  useable.

Until the most recent update this app worked perfectly for controlling my lights along with my Amazon Echos. Since the update, the echo keeps reporting that it was unable to make the lighting adjustments I requested successfully and yet it actually does make the adjustment. Similarly, where as the lights used to fade out when I made the request via the Echo they now abruptly turn off. This is all since the most recent update. Please investigate, I use this daily and I'd like the functionality to be back the way it was.

The echo dot has incredible potential. I can tell by the responses I get when I ask certain questions. However, if it depends on the horrible app for its skills as an AI, it's getting no where slowly with each update. I really want to like the Echo and I'm hanging on Alexa but...

I see Amazon Echo as a device for the next level of intellectual technology. As Amazon expands with other companies to make the Echo usful for talking to more devices. Not everyone can hook up to Alexa yet. This disadvantages those that do have Alexa. I bought the Fire stick believing that Alexa and the stick would talk to my TV like I saw on the Dish Network commercial. Amazon please make Alexa work with all HDTV by developing access or devices without having to by all these pieces. I believe Alexa or any communication device that creates a smart atmosphere is the future. I can see this technology, as it it develops, being present everywhere even in automobile.

Well it doesn't look like a native app and seems it runs a website beneath and is slow. The echo device is great once setup. But the setup process is too painful and annoying. During setup at times it just doesn't recognize wifi networks. If I change my wifi passpord, running the whole setup is too difficult. The app ( or rather the website undeneath app ) also gets unresponsive sometimes in few setup screens, specially after the app connects to echo and it shows a 'Continue' button which doesn't respond. EDIT: I got a new echo Dot and setup is hung up on step showing 'Attempting to connect to echo dot'. The phone got connected to the dots WiFi but nothing happens in setup process. Setup is just too painful.

Still holding off updating based on the consistently poor reviews.

Previous review: Painfully slow to launch and needs to relaunch after a short time when not in use. Some buttons on the app do absolutely nothing, like/dislike music for example. Sluggish performance when moving between different sections. Not a well thought out interface for communication. I would instantly uninstall but you need this app for certain tasks.

I like using Alexa but I really want to use the list function more effectively. I don't understand why we don't have the option to have more than one list. Could it be that Amazon fears we might buy something from somewhere else besides Amazon?  Also, the list does not put enough items on a page (too much whitespace).

Overall Alexa and I have a love/hate relationship. Voice recognition can be hit and miss, it needs some work before it's completely outclassed by competitors. One of the biggest shortcomings is the sporadic ability to stream music from multiple Alexa devices on the same home network. Sometimes it works and other times it tells you that you can only stream on one device at a time. The idea of this device is amazing but the user experience is lacking.

Useless battery killer! Shopping list never opens, just keeps trying to load causing extreme battery drain. For example, my wife and I just went grocery shopping. Prior to going in, we both attempted to open the shopping list on our phones. Neither of use could get it to work. It loaded for a sec on my phone then disappered. We tried opening it several more times while in the store then gave up. It made my wife's phone overheat and shut off. My phone got very hot and battery went from 84% to 34% all in about 30mins.

It's useful for experimenting with as a coder. But hardly useful as an assistant, unless you just want it as an alarm clock or light switch.

I have used this app for about a year. You can certainly tell by the reviews the fan base out there, mine is better than yours. In our house we use Siri Google and Alexa so I think I can give an unbiased review. None are perfect but neither are any useless. we tend to use Alexa more because we have prime. The app takes my shopping list, organises my calendar plus allows me to control lights, heating, security and more. It is installed on several android devices and performs differently on each one . It is not perfect but is always evolving. It is definitely fit for purpose.

This app is only on my phone because it is required by my Echo Dot. I can not edit reminders without it bugging out and not letting me type text or change the date/time. It often doesn't load and says I have no internet when I have full wifi signal and every other service requiring internet on my phone is up and working. If this app didn't have so many bugs, it would be sooooo much better!! Please fix and I will rate higher!!!!

I can forgive the errors on the voice recognition on echo as it's relatively new but the app is shockingly poor. It offers friends to type in so you can customise your settings but the ok or submit buttons are never enabled so you have no way of customising it at all.

Main echo is pretty good and they seem to be coming out with more features...   After owning this for over a year it randomly turns on or just starts talking for no reason. Voice commands are sometimes great other times almost impossible - I see little logic to why.   I made a poor decision in purchasing 2 echo dots. Neither one will work after troubleshooting both for literally hours each.   Waste of money waste of time.

App was ok before, not the best but was working at least. Since update to Oreo it force closes when I try to modify alarms. The Oreo developer window started a while ago, I have a hard time understanding how Amazon didn't check to make sure basic functions work in the new environment. How did this not get tested or even detected during basic debugging? I'll update my review when you update the App you require customers to use for the device they bought from you.

Not great to be honest. Struggles to recognise voice often and repeats something absolutely different that sounds in no way similar to what you say. It will also start speaking randomly when not being used. Usually at least 10 second delay between request being confirmed and the song/radio station coming on. Wish I'd bought Google device instead.

Not sure why so many bad reviews. Seems a lot of reviews are on the device itself and not the app. 2 totally different things. Once paired you really don't need the app. App works great and always has same with the echo itself. Never had 1 issue. It understands me 99.9% of the time the other .1% is because either the tv is too loud but not the device itself. Someone was talking carp about searching music. Just say a name of a song or artist and it will be played. I think most reviews are due to user error and not the device. Sure the app could use a little work but for the most part it works flawlessly. Easy to find skills and set alarms, add more devices and link my smart home devices. I don't know why people say it's hard to connect to WiFi because it is the easiest device I've ever hooked up to my wifi. Its never lost connection either. Only when the power has gone out but as soon as it's back on so is alexa. I have over 70 devices paired with the app and alexa has not once messed up when giving a command to lock a door or turn on a light. I would definitely recommend it over Google home any day.

This app is quite bad. It's unconscionably slow. Initial load times are slow. Opening the now playing is slow. Everything takes ages, are we sure it's 2017 and I'm on a high end device?  Additionally, functionality is not what it should be. Why is playing Amazon's own music service so hard? Sometimes Alexa doesn't understand me and I want to play a specific song or album from Amazon Music Unlimited - you can't, apparently it's just radio and popular. What on Earth and I paying for this service for then? Spotify gives you full control of Alexa music from the app.   Also while the new whole home audio festure is welcome, it's still lacking. I need to be able to submit a device into multiple groups. I have five echos. Maybe I want a group for my upstairs echos, my downstairs echos, and a whole home option? Can't do that. Silly.

Like many others, i downloaded this app since i was forced to inorder to operate alexa. It only takes a minute and a half to load every time i use it, and it is a very long search to find the right button whenever i want to find what song is playing. Good luck trying to set-up bluetooth connection. Recently it started asking to restart the installation process although nothing changed, and have had it installed since christmas. After i complete re-installation and it says my alexa is ready to use, it kindly starts the installation process all over again. Yep this app has opportunities for improvement.

Either responds with "not sure how to help you with that", or LEDs just spin and then nothing happens. Can't pause the Hopper, can't tune to a channel or anything else. Just another piece of "shelfware" now.  Update: Now appears each time Alexa app updates, Dish skill quits working and must be in/reinstalled.  Dish skill also needs to be smarter and more flexible, but I assume that's on Dish to do. Updatingto 2 stars.

What kills this app for me is that you can't use it like an Echo remote, and it is lacking a search function that lets you type (for when Alexa just can NOT understand you for whatever reason).

Clunkiest app I have on my phone.  Trying to access my "Lists" takes several minutes.  What good is a list if you have to stand in the produce section for 5 minutes to see it?  And it really does take over 5 minutes at times.  My screen times out at 5 minutes, and it is still thinking.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times.  @jeffbezos, major fail.

Not the Echo, the app. This app. Without the app being installed on my Galaxy 7, I can use my Amazon Echo, play music, enable skills, etc and as long as I'm connected to my wifi I use NO data. But when I install this app, and even if I am not using the Echo, my data allowance begins to burn away rapidly.  When I put my phone down &amp; my screen times out, my wifi gets disconnected.  When I use my phone and open the screen, I see a popup telling my my wifi has been connected... meaning it was disconnected during the phones down time. I have searched but cannot find a setting within the app that may stop this. So, I cannot keep it installed.  If there is a fix gor this please let me know. Sent from my Samsung Galaxy S7.

Disappointing. Both Echo and the Alexa app. The weather skill can't even tell you humidity. Now, as of July 28, control of Wemo devices has become erratic and semi-functional. I have updated Wemo device firmware, re-enabled the Wemo account connection, re-dscovered devices within the Alexa app, but it's still extremely retarded, with very long delays between the command and whatever execution it decides to implement (which varies from attempt to attempt.) I might blame Wemo, since it's a terrible app as well, but all devices are currently working fine from the Wemo app. My main motivation with Alexa/Echo was home automation control, but it's not reliable. Waking up to a noise, and saying "Alexa; lights on" should, you know, turn on the lights. But Alexa hesitates for a substantial period of time, then might (or might not) turn on a totally random selection of Wemo devices. Not ready for Prime time, pun intended. Alexa and my Echo devices are mostly just music streaming speakers now, and the only devices with a decent speaker for that purpose are the tall original Echos. Besides, with Amazon devices, unlike Google Home, you can't get the same stream coordinated on multiple devices concurrently. The Echo Show speakers are very directional (and the device is also hard of hearing.) If I could undo the whole mess, I would today.

As an example, for the first time in my life (I am almost 60) my shopping list is complete and I can choose whether to purchase an item now or next week. Also all of my "to do's" are kept on one list. With Amazon's generous return policy, if you even think you might like Alexa, and you are a Prime member, ought to try her.

This app is so slow and buggy. What prompted me to write the review was that there's no easy way to explore amazon music unlimited's options for artists. There are so many artists that a basic scroll  (which takes forever to load) makes it so hard to navigate. Additionally, the artists with "the" in the title are all listed under "the" alphabetically. There's no filtering in order to narrow it down to the artists you want. I think the purpose of this app is to help navigate all of the things Alexa can do for you, and it's so immensely frustrating. Work on this app, amazon!!

Love my echo dots. The Alexa app is okay, I like that changes are continuous, improvements all the time. It isn't perfect but as long as they keep putting in the effort then they have an opportunity to keep on dominating this market.

Right now, I can't even get into the app that I've been using before all these updates. The app is demanding that I set up information so that Alexa knows me better. I don't want to use texting features or any other communication with Alexa. All I want to do right now is turn off Pandora from the app, and I can't even do that.

Sometimes Alexa is OK. Like checking the Weather. Sometimes it's not; like doing anything else useful. Sometimes it's good for music. Until it's not a common title and she can't figure it out. Sometimes, it's great for playing music from your paid Unlimited subscription. Unless you want to actually search for a song or album... because the app is completely useless. Amazon's response to that: Alexa is a voice activated tool. Useless. 10/10 would argue with Alexa for hours again.

The app is very slow. I am also very disappointed with the unlimited music portion. Why is there no search option? You have to scroll through "All Artists  A-Z" or by Genre. Hopefully this will get updated along with the speed of the app.

I can't find a good reason to keep this app. It doesn't seem to perform as other Alexa devices do. I don't own Alexa, but I do have Alexa through my Fire TV. And it's easy to hold down the microphone and order stuff from Amazon, ask questions, and everything else Alexa is supposed to do. But I can't find a microphone or any way to speak into this app. So what's a good for?

Echo is a good device along with the two Dots I have but after doing the usual things like setting alarms and playing Amazon Music on them there is one big problem, they cannot play radio stations for more than 30 seconds. I ask Alexa to play BBC Radio 2 which starts up straight away, but about 30 seconds later, silence. If you ask Alexa to stop and then restart then the radio continues, so it has to be an Echo problem. I have ultrafast broadband and excellent wifi, so know that's not the problem.

I despise this app. It takes ages to load; pauses all music when you do open it; and tries to force features on you. I'm on an LG V10 and for over a month now I'm forced to restart the app if I want to avoid signing up for messanger (upon initial opening you have no skip screen, emailed support with screenshot and they stopped replying). I use this as a glorified grocery list and it's almost too much of a hassel for that.

Much room for improvement but at least it is functional for the most part. Needs better integration with Music Unlimited. Bluetooth pairing hit and miss and when you do get devices paired the app won't let you see them all and blocks options for the last device on the list with an action button.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for 1 reason. It has to be connected to the internet for EVERYTHING! I live in condos that provide free WiFi which goes down occasionally. When that happens, you can't even ask what time it is! No setting a timer, an alarm, no add to shopping list, nothing! All she can say is, "sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to the internet.

Drop In on Dots is 1 out of 5 stars. I've got excellent bandwidth and an awesome wireless router. After getting the fancy email, I felt very excited about Drop In. Like when the update related for Zune revealing fancy new wireless functionality, it was like a bonus - remember?! Drop in however in my book, should never have been released in its current state. It's not solid, fades in and out, the volume is too low and uses the onboard speaker, breaking the bluetooth connection to that speaker, and is an embarrassment. I had someone excited to experience the new feature, but drop in was dropping out. I hope someone at amazon sees this post and explains why this was released when I'd give it a 2 out of 10 for overall satisfaction. Disappointing.

The app uses a significant amount of battery power and mobile data, even though I don't open it at all. One might think it has to do with the new Alexa calling feature but when I try to call from my echo, the phone never rings and Alexa says she can't connect. Why is this app then the 2nd heaviest battery user and why does it use hundreds of megabytes of data? Very unhappy with it?

Can't set the dot up to connect to a hotspot on the phone. As part of the final setup the app connects the dot using the phones WiFi, turning on the WiFi turns off the hotspot, turning off the hotspot cause the app to give a failed connection error turning on the hotspot turns off the WiFi which causes the setup to completely fail and prompts to retry the setup. So I'm basically stuck in a poor experience loop, thus making the app useless.

I can still yell at my echo to play specific artists/albums; but browsing via the app does not work.   Funnily enough,  I can just use Firefox on my phone to visit the Amazon website, search music, and it will play on echo.   So... Why bother with the app at all?

Alexa barely does anything bad play music and read the weather out. Outsourcing the compatible apps was lazy. This app is slick but the add ins aren't. Getting to find the conversation icon is a bloody nightmare. Still haven't got it. Need far more inbuilt integration and a search engine. Whole bloody system is crud. Wish I hadn't bought it as it's driving me mad by being incompatible with just about anything I want to do. Can't turn on TV, lights, sound didn't flow through rooms, seeing up prickles is easy but could be done by voice recognition.

Will man Alexa in englischer Sprache verwenden, benötigt man einen amazon account der UK/US basierend ist. Sonst stehen keinerlei skills zur Verfügung.   "Die ausgewählte Spracheinstellung stimmt nicht mit den Einstellungen Ihres Amazon-Kontos überein.  Daher werden Sie nicht auf Skills zugreifen können."  Wenn man den Account auf z.B. UK umstellt, hat man zwar die skills, aber es fehlt z.B. das Prime musik abbo welches dann immer noch nur für den deutschen Account gültig ist.

It talks too much, doesn't hear me right and goes on about something. Have to wait or yell at it till it shuts up.  Lights reset colors everytime with hue, why have colored lights if it just going to be yellow  by default. It needs an advanced mode, with less instruction and better listening or better stop commands. Even the alarm is impossible to stop with out yelling at it from 3 feet.

The app itself needs fine tuning. Pressing back doesnt take you back to your search page it takes you back to the home page. There could be a little description in each mini pic because selecting each one and then getting sent back to homepage when looking for a new skill gets old fast. The skills are mostly garbage too. Either not written well or really obscure things few people want/need. So far Alexas only useful if you already have a bunch of other things you pay monthly for and alexa binds them together. Not very interesting. Your phone already does that.

The original Alexa app was awesome.  You could do everything on it, and it worked well.  Then, a few iterations ago, the app had a massive overhaul, and it SUCKS!  The app freezes constantly, especially when trying to engage the alarms feature; you can no longer search for music through the app, itself, so functionality is lost; etc.  Truly, the Alexa app is truly, truly terrible.  If you are trying to decide between Google Home and Alexa, I might recommend Google Home now... and this is coming from someone who has invested in two Alexa speakers and loves (or, loved) them.

Also the ability to use voice commands with tunein to play podcasts in chronological order from first episode to last. The use of voice commands to play certain episodes of podcasts. The ability to fast forward/rewind in epiodes of podcasts. Until these features are added there is no point to include tunein as an in app feature.

I have a couple Echo devices around the house and love them for various uses, especially home automation. You need this app to configure those echo devices.  However, Amazon in the past few iterations has added "Alexa Calling" to the app and the echoes and they rope you into activating it. Not only is it a manipulative and sleazy way to get people to "opt-in" (by making it very difficult to avoid opting in and still using the product), it also doesn't let you turn the feature off, you HAVE TO CALL AMAZON CUSTOMER SUPPORT to disable a very invasive unwanted and nearly useless feature.  Super sleazy on Amazon's part. Especially for an app with so many rampant privacy issues.

Do not buy alexa as a gift to someone.  I've gone to friends' houses to find out they don't use them because it is always "offline". If you are thinking of buying, explore google.

Dear Amazon this is really lovely and a step towards the future. However the set up on the app looses a point for not letting people know that they could save a great deal of time searching for a solution to the problem of them reaching the set-up page to find it constantly remains a blank screen without it ever connecting. Amazon you could simply correct this by informing Samsung s7 customers to disable auto network switching (in WiFi settings/more) first! Otherwise, good job!

Easy to set up with a tablet.  Calls and messaging setup comes with the app being on a cellphone or tablet with call and messaging features. Skills setup was slightly challenging in the absence of printed instructions in the box with the Dot.  I had all of my smart plug connected devices enabled and controlled by Alexa in about 10 minutes. I did have to change abbreviated names to full names for Alexa to recognize and complete commands. I am impressed with the limited use I have employed so far. My next test will be disconnecting power and reconnecting to determine if there is continuity with the setup and connection to Amazon echo services since I do not intend to have my DOT connected 24/7 for privacy considerations.

--Update for calling causes app to crash constantly. After installing it looks like it will open and work properly, but when it gets to the step where it requires you to pick your name from a list, it crashes. I can't skip the voice set up, but attempting to complete it crashes the app every time. I've uninstalled and reinstalled a half dozen times to fix it - not only is it wasting my time, it's making my $500 in Alexa devices significantly less useful. Completely flipping worthless update - don't risk it til the bugs are repaired.--  Update: the bugs are repaired. Voice calling works seamlessly between my phone and all of my Alexa devices.

And having to shout over a song to tell the device to turn the music down has got to be one of the most frustrating first-world problems ever.

The original Alexa app was wonderful. Ever since they updated to allow calls, it sucks. A lot. Why would they design function out of a great and easy to use app. It's not just that it's unreliable, but the interface is ugly and difficult to use. For example, changing the volume from the app now requires you ever-so-delicately place your finger in the exact right place or else you mute sound, make it extremely loud, make the volume option disappear or some combination of all of the above.

The computer age for me is admittedly one or two generations younger than I am. So, even though I can't possibly comprehend all the potential within this app, the sheer fascination with it earns the highest rating I can give. The consistent problem I have is the avalanche of research necessary to plod through learning how to use it. Normally I would give a lower rating because of the mandated learning curve. Yet, everything we have been able to apply has not only been useful, but fun. Consider this: when I was a kid, my parents sometimes still read by candle light. True story. Echo is near magic to me right alongside being able to talk with someone through a hand held communicator and computers that talk. Those things would never be real, right?
