Pretty decent. They've got most of the kinks worked out. Kind of wish I could have a truly random away mode or one program that cues various lights are different times, but I can do those things with just a few more button presses than I should need so I guess it's fine.

I love this little device... I'm a crypto currency miner and I love the fact I can track my usage and be able to remotely reboot my computers. Only thing I don't like is the power button that is actually on the device itself. Sometimes I reach to touch the wemo to see if it's hot and I accidentally switch the power off as the switch is far too sensitive. Also it's rated at 1800 watts but when I push 12/1300 watts thru it, it gets very hot. This makes me a tad bit nirvous... But other than that works like a charm.

Got 3 wemo light switches on clearance for cheap 3 years ago. They worked flawlessly until this year when I upgraded my WiFi router. Nothing but trouble since then. Sad, I loved my wemos. Called support, no help at all. Really wish they would enhance the WiFi compatibility but at the time they said they have no plans for that. Seems like Eco and G.Home may get them to remove their heads from their butts.

There are available video help to set-up. Programing the schedule was a challenge at first but as you go through the learning process like phones when they're new - you'll be able to figure it out.

After latest update on 8/15/17 rules still DON'T work. Trying to see Settings &amp; About doesn't work in the app, instead it always automatically skips to the Rules section which also doesn't work. No matter how many times I repeatedly try to schedule rules the app then never saves them. This has been going on for months now. I can't automate any of my 5 WeMo devices from within the app. I can see all the devices and even rename them in the app but can't apply any rules to them.

App works great and shows a lot of useful data about electricity used on the Wemo Insight. I have my Mac plugged in, and it starts up when the outlet is turned on. The Wemo recognises when the Mac is sleeping and using  7 watts, which it calls "standby." The standby threshold can be changed if necessary. The cost per KWh can be specified to estimate how much it costs to run the device plugged into the Wemo.

Does what it supposed to but why does it have to shut off the switch when upgrading the firmware?  I have to shut down my server to do the firmware update and when done the switch stays in the off state.  I only have one plug like this,  the rest of the house runs on Z-Wave which scales much better and runs on its own network. Also at this price point the switches should report the energy usage.

App was okay until the last update. I have no idea where my existing rules are. Tried to go in to update the times and have no clue where my existing rules are in the app. It is getting dark earlier and now I can't adjust the times.

The only thing worse than the units is the customer service. I have 4 of the new generation. That is over $160 of useless stuff.

Edit: Getting better but still not great. Firmware update fails and there's no way for me to force update. It's all luck on when the app decides to tell me if there is update available.  Piece of garbage. No linking of device to any unique account means if your app data gets corrupted, you've lost control of your device until the next time you go home. Thats a huge oversight for something meant to be managed remotely. To the person that calls the rest of us dumb as rocks. What a fantastic review. So very helpful.

The ability to turn my WeMo switches on and off with an app is awesome. However, my biggest criticisms are: 1) the app takes too long to load (and it has a splash screen), 2) when using the app over LTE (while standing in my house) there is a delay between pressing the app button and the WeMo switch turning on/off, 3) The app doesn't let me group my multiple WeMo switches.

I keep reading about WeMo so I bought the smart plug and BOY DOES THIS APP SUCK!!! OMG what a horrible app. This is made by kids and the people who gave it more than 1 star are technology illiterate or old people who aren't aware of how a smart product should function. Connecting the plug was horrible, had to click on "try again" numerous times. Once connected, tried to name it, it disconnects over and over again only to find out the name hasn't changed. Did that 5 times, then gave up and clicked on save. The app connected to my WiFi. Everything finally seemed to have worked. Linked it to Google home, tried to turn it on and off by voice, home acknowledges the command but nothing happens with the plug. Found out there's an update but no way to manually update it. Found a workaround, when I click on "update now" it takes me to a Window to update the device. Clicked on "accept and update" and guess what....nothing happens. Bought 3 of those plugs, returning them tomorrow!!! Unbelievable what this world is coming too.

Rules do not work! I had defined many rules, now they do not appear in the app. The power of these "smart" devices is the rules. If the only way to turn these devices on and off is manually, then they are not "smart" devices.

Before trying the wemo, I tried a couple different manufactures of wifi timers and returned them because the would work reliably. I have had the wemo for 9 months now and they have worked perfectly.

I love everything except I can see my parents wemo controls when I'm at their house and vice versa and can control wemos as well. I assume this is because we know each other's wifi password and use the same app. This has got to be changed, an invasion of privacy to say the least. We don't know each other's wemo passwords but that doesn't matter because the app automatically finds whatever wemos are on the wifi. Please fix this.

Why would you.limit sales by not allowing users to install WeMo devices at other locations, like the cabin or the office?

Update (9/11/17) - I was mistaken. I cant control my Mini over my VPN, even though Im connected to my LAN. Dissapointing. The official Philips Hue app supports this functionality. I dont see why this couldnt work the same. Ill keep trying, but if I cant find a solution to remotely controlling the plug over my VPN, Ill have to return the device. Major bummer.  Just got this (9/9/17.) So far so good, this wemo MINI is everything Ive been looking for: 1. A connected outlet, providing simple on/off control from my phone/tablet devices. 2. It HAD to be accessible from the internet, NOT through a wemo account/servers, but instead over my own VPN connection to my LAN. 3. An app with reasonable permissions, that I can deny on a per-feature basis, without breaking the app. 4. Finally, I need it to be reliable. (Manual control of firmware updates should contribute to that, but Id like to see a detailed change log displayed when they are offered.) This wemo device and app are, so far, on par with my Hue lights for function, ease of use, and flexibility. If this continues to hold true, I can see more wemo devices in my future. wemo, so far, is a pleasant surprise, in a world of over reaching, flaky, and consumer-hostile software, hardware, and services.

Disappointed. After reading positive reviews decided to try this instead of a cheaper switch from a competitor unfortunately the WeMo is inferior.  This app is terrible. possibly the most buggy Android app I've ever used in many years of Android use . I purchased 2 mini smart plug devices and neither of them have worked consistently since the day I set them up. One works from time to time the other shows "not available" even after multiple attempts to reset the device. This app is awful and takes multiple minutes to load simple commands.

Overall, it works ok. It's weakness is that it fails to recognize a light that's been turned on (or on then off) since  the last time you used the Wemo app. You have to switch the light manually before Wemo can "see" it, then you must close the app and start it again before it will let you adjust the lighting.

The link has to be reset if you change routers or your wifi password. Then it's a huge pain to get it recognized by the app and back onto the network. You have to setup bulbs again too. It's also not one of the wemo products supported by Amazon Echo a d you have to use ifttt

Have tones of problem.  A lot of time it doesn't work and it's not simply restart the app or the phone can fix the problem.  Had to go through the long process to reset the switch sometimes.  I own the other 2 or 3 brand of smart plug/switch and this is the worst one even it's such a popular brand.  Already had it for  4 months and still can't connect to the device once a while.  My dad's iPhone can't find the device at all and the customer service just said it's his phone problem not helpful at all.  Update: It has been over a year and the device still not be seen by the app half of the time.  Even wait for a few days, still not connect to the app.   Do you guys even care about the issue.

I used to have this rated at one star, bit it's gotten a lot better. Belkin is slow but consistent in fixing issues and making this more stable, and they're now at the point where I can call it good and recommend it to non-tech enthusiasts. If you want to make rules for electronics and don't mind going through setup 3 times when it fails the first two, wemo is amazing. Once you have everything setup the way you want....in the word of Steve Jobs, it just works. IFTTT integration is good too.

Tends to lose connection to one switch over WiFi, but not cellular. Latest update has made my rules disappea, yet somehow still function. Overall still a hot mess. I'm using my old plugs now at the apartment I'm in for med school, but at my aunt's house I already switched everything from WeMo to Z-wave. If you want home automation, don't even look at WeMo. It's beyond being the worst platform.
compound: -0.8834, neg: 0.139, neu: 0.842, pos: 0.019, 

The WeMo devices work very nicely and I am impressed.  I have an issue with how the application shows me a loading screen, then it shows me a connecting to network screen, then it shows me the devices if they are detected, (they fail about 20% of the time) then it has to refresh the status on all devices. This means if i want to turn on the light for a room with my device i have to wait somewhere from 20 sec to 2 min to flip a light switch.  You need to cache this data and refresh it in the background, and use push messages on status changes for updates.  The app is also lacking widgets for the home screen, a fast easy way to toggle devices is critical for ease of use.  There is also a problem that the application times out frequently when creating rules or the failing to save a rule.

The app shows me an average usage of a few minutes a day and average monthly costs of around 0.50€. I wish it was true but I use my switch with all my a/v equipment attached for an average of 8 hours a day so it doesn't monitor the usage/cost correctly! So all it does is turn on/off remotely and for that there are cheaper options on the market!

It works.  But that's like saying "meets expectations" on the report card so I give it a grade of C.  It's very pretty but not functional or user friendly.   The app craps out during the firmware update, changing settings on each wemo requires a five seconds delay after each button press, etc.  I think the only reason they are the top of mind brand is because of their first mover advantage in making a C level app and product.  Maybe my expectations are too high.

This app needs a lot of work. Very slow. Setting up wemo mini not a streamlined workflow. Would have thought twice about buying these if Id seen the app rating first. To get 5 stars, app needs streamlined workflow for setting up new wemo minis without the confusion for android devices and auto network select. Would also need a much more responsive app overall. The time between a tap and a reaction is several seconds and there is often no indication that a tap occured and the app was doing things. My guess is that wemo outsourced the creation of this app without a lot of QA on the release because internally developed apps rarely have this poor of an experience.

This frigging thing. Do not purchase these. They work occasionally. I have reset it, updated it, troubleshooted and even reinstalled it. I never post reviews, but this piece deserves one. It decides when it wants to function. The only time you can use it is when you've just recently turned it off or on. Otherwise, it goes into a sleep mode and doesn't respond.  Very. Very. Disappointed customer.

Better than previous versions.    Still slow. Needs the ability to select a device and force an update of firmware. It would be nice to add an icon to the phone 's menu to toggle each device without opening the full app. It would need some sort of a multi step process to prevent accidental "butt dialling".
compound: 0.7783, neg: 0.022, neu: 0.825, pos: 0.153, 

Setup could be a bit smoother since at one point it felt like I was just guessing as what to do, but after it's setup the app is fine and UI is intuative.  The original smart plug is GIANT.  I'm glad they shrunk it down so it doesn't take up 3 outlets on a strip anymore.  It's worth the 25 bucks I paid for it.  Main reason I got it was it's Alexa compatible.

Not the most user friendly interface. Clumsy and difficult to set schedules. Has a lot of glitches during scheduling but once you finally get it, works well. Auto away feature doesn't work at all. This app really needs some work as the product is great.

Hit and miss.  Has not operated correctly since install.  The Away feature has not worked. Turned the light on  but didn't turn it off.  Today it has not turned the light on, but Rules state that it is active. Says it needs an update but quickly says its happy.  Then mini states it needs to update??  If the light won't come on and off as scheduled, then what's the point of this?  There needs to be stable functionality right quick, or there's a refund in my near future.

Great product with excellent Amazon Echo (i.e. "Alexa") integration.  That said, configuring the WeMo Light Switch via the Wemo app can be a buggy experience, particularly if you already have other Wemo devices.&nbsp; The workaround for this is to temporarily disable the cellular service (i.e. 4G) on your phone, thereby forcing the app to use the Wifi hotspot created by the Wemo Light Switch.

These devices are great when they work. The big problem with them is that they rarely work with no issues.

"Be home even when you're not" their slogan is a complete lie. Glad we only bought one device. We specifically bought to run our lights when we are out of town. Away mode has never worked. I'm better off buying an old fashion timer. Tried to turn the lights on and off manually on our last trip away and it wouldn't connect to the switch at all. Terrible expensive product.

The instructions are none existant both for the hardware and the app. I can see no point in this at all. It is utterly useless. Thankfully I bought it from Amazon.  It goes back tomorrow.

Works fine, but why does it need access to everything in my phone? Something changed in a recent update. You can no longer enable a rule once it is disabled. You must delete and create a new rule. Becoming iritating. I have only 1  usable schedule. On old outlet timer works better.

Painfully slow, buggy and non-intuitive. It crashed and required reinstalling during initial setup of my first device.

Whatever you do, do NOT update the firmware on any device. It simply doesn't work. There should be repercussions for people putting out such awful software. Too many viable alternatives to this startup-quality automaton to have to endure the products. I foolishly bought 3 Wemo devices. Lesson learned to late. Avoid Wemo.

At first, I was disappointed because the app did not adequately connect with the switches or reflect the current status over the internet. They would only work over home Wi-Fi. They seem to have addressed this issue, though, because everything seems to work flawlessly now. I often forget to turn off lights when I leave for the university in the morning and this allows me to easily remedy that from afar. A cool use for the apps automated scheduling is, I was able to take a refrigerator that did not have automatic defrost and set the refrigerator so that it intermittently shut off for short periods of time to allow the coils to defrost. Pretty nifty.
compound: 0.7964, neg: 0.051, neu: 0.831, pos: 0.118, 

The app itself works fine, it's the Wemo Switch that doesn't. It constantly loses connection to my home wifi for no reason, I've moved it to different areas of the house, made sure it's not blocked somehow, and still only works half of the time. I'd save your money.
compound: 0.783, neg: 0.039, neu: 0.764, pos: 0.197, 

Rediculasly difficult to set up. You download the app just to find out 10 minutes later that it won't work until you update the app. Then after updating the app it freezes up the original app so at that point nothing works. This product must be made in Russia because it is a communist plot to drive you insane. The box says it is designed to make your life easier but it actually does the oposit
compound: -0.0258, neg: 0.059, neu: 0.895, pos: 0.045, 

Can't rename devices.  Devices get lost for minutes at a time.  The state of the devise does not match that of the actual device.  This feels like an amateur's first attempt at writing network software.  Avoid WEMO until the software is more mature.    UPDATE: It still sucks.  Update of the update:  after a couple of app and firmware updates...   ...it still sucks.  I threw the switches away and I'm looking for a home automation system that works.
compound: -0.4417, neg: 0.116, neu: 0.816, pos: 0.068, 

Terribly slow, has trouble detecting devices, setting up new devices rarely works. I could go on. Once you finally get things going, leave it alone because you cringe every time you have to go back into the app. This app needs a rebuild and fast!
compound: -0.8313, neg: 0.201, neu: 0.799, pos: 0.0, 

This app is completely unreliable. I had to do a factory reset on the light switch twice before the app found the switch. It took dozens of attempts just to set up the switch to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise.  That was the only reason I bought the switch, to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

The app is really buggy and a really poor experience. Rules sometimes can't be enabled after they're disabled, sometimes only the start times shows when trying to set a schedule, and sometimes the app just hangs. It's just taken me 10 mins to set a schedule for a lamp to turn on for 2 hours every morning. I'll never buy another WeMo.

Typically apps improve overtime. WeMo has decided to go against the grain and get worse. I used to be able to control my WeMo from anywhere. Since the latest update, now it says i can only control it from my home network. This almost 100% defeats the purpose of buying one. It's just a fat plug adapter at this point. Good job guys

I mean this sincerely.  Whoever you have designing your app, fire them. If you are selling a product that is dedicated to being a mobile product, the mobile app should be the main concern for you.  Everything is wrapped around an app that is slow, buggy, clumsy, and the user interface is awful. How can this be the product you're offering to the consumers and you sell it with a straight face. Get this thing together, get some management in your development teams, and redesign this immediately.  I would be embarrassed if I was leadership at this company.....  That's all.

Works fine with the app...sometimes.  Many other times, the app says that it doesn't recognize the device and you need to shut the app down and reset it in order to recognize its own devices. DO NOT purchase these to use with Google Home. Works for about an hour and then it stops. Won't recognize the device until you reset it.

Had this for a few years now. Refuses to find even one of my insight switches or the older switches. Yet can remote access my network. So only woks locally. App and set up says remote enabled!! App lacks features and 4 years on the App remains poor.    Despite contacting tech support  Rules still cannot be saved for switch or insight switch.   The app simply gets stuck with circular hour glass making them pointless or just fails to save them or show the ones created???     Software still needs a lot of work!

It is OK but sometimes disconnects on a switch so you have to restart the app or device the app is loaded on. Forget about, turning the switch on manually and then off with the app. It will show the switch grayed out. I wish it were more reliable. Today the outlet switch grayed out for no reason.

Very temperamental to hook up and keep hooked up to your router. I have a Netgear router to include ACN 5k, and signal strength in a 1800 Sq Ft. Home is not strong enough to run devices more than 35 ft from router.  Love the concept. Firmware updates seem to help but it's not perfect. If your modules will be close to router the system can work great. Good for disabled people who can't go to outlets or light switches.

The software and switches are fairly user hostile. Prior to the introduction of Smartthings I installed many WeMo light switches and power outlets. Network connections were never completely stable. Once I converted to Smartthings / Zwave / ZigBee network, the WeMo devices were clearly the weakest link in my home automation. I'm gradually replacing them. Also, Smartthings tech support is outstanding. WeMo is non-existent. So, it mostly works as advertised, but is completely obsolete, at least in my home.

I've preservered with this product for over a year. It has fundamental problems. The standalone socket works fine, but the Link and lamps are inherently unreliable. Not sure if it's down poor WiFi or interference. But the link and app rarely communicate. The link Nevers finds the lamps even when located close. I think it's down to poor programming and the underlying architecture.  Moving to another supplier after I take out my frustration by destroying the devices. An expensive mistake.

This app is not for everyone, you need a certain level of knowledge regarding wifi and connecting your switches so it may seem cumbersome at the beginning. Once you go to the steps and have everything up and running is actually quite useful, especially if you have little ones turning on every single light switch there is and not turning them off.

When it works, it's great. Problem is it only lasts a short time and then you have reset everything, and it's difficult to set up. When your out of town and the plug-ins stop communicating with the app, it becomes useless. The light switch is the worst culprit. Don't even think about doing the updates that they insist on when your away from home where the plug-ins are, you will lose the ability to communicate with most of the plug-ins.  By the way,  all of my plug-ins are close to router communication. Too bad, I've had wemo plug-ins for a long time now, and it's never improved.

b"I give this app 2 stars only because I was eventually able to setup my insights switch after perilously trying. The app is too complex with too many steps to achieve the simple objective of setup. The app is slow and hung frequently. The UX is primitive. I had to struggle for a while to figure out the scheduling feature ?? Trying to setup my second insight switch was a nightmare.

I hoped to like this app, but as of now there are too many annoyances. The biggest one is that, for my wemo light bulbs, the dimmer slider appears 1/10 times at random when using the app; The rest of the time I have to use IFTTT to sett the brightness of my bulb. Secondly, the app uses too much time when loading, this is because the app for some reason has to load every wemo device every time you go to the main screen. I wouldn't complain about this if it weren't for the fact that using the widgets does not have this delay, which means that the app shouldn't either. I would love if you could fix these problems as I really want to like Wemo, but at this moment I'm a bit disappointed.

Just want to update my review and say that this app is still bad and does not work well. To add to the commonly used phrases - poor design and hit or miss usage. The firmware needs to be updated literally every day, and I don't mean that in the hyperbolic sense.   I mean every day I open the app and it prompts me to download the latest firmware, rendering the app unusable for an hour or more. I use a VPN and sometimes the bulbs are recognized and sometimes they aren't, which means I need to turn off the VPN, open the app and turn on my lights, and then turn on my VPN again. I implore you to buy any other brand of smart bulb or switch instead of this very mediocre technology. I took the cheap route and I regret it.  I own 7 bulbs, a wemo link, an insight and a switch. It took 4 support people and over 5 hours of talk time to get the products working properly. I was expecting the seamless setup of other home automation devices I have and this was definitely not seamless.  There is a security glitch in that about once a week I can see my neighbors wemo devices.  Terrible app. Really terrible.

Slow clunky and full of bugs, linked services work only sporadically and the app seems to spend more time updating its own firmware than actually operating my appliances.

Don't buy more than one or two devices. It's great for those, but add more and then every firmware rollout, you are going to have failures. The maintenance of a single failed switch is going to cost you half a day at best, but perhaps a week or two.  And then... another failure is going to happen again next update. But at least you'll have practice this time   The future isn't here yet. Wait a little longer before investing in these.

Switch is a pain to set up with its wifi network not being detected then losing connection, and the app is even worse. It's the only app on my phone where I have to tap 30 times to get from 3:15 to 3:45. Why, in 2017, can this app still not scroll through numbers?! Takes a lot of taps to edit rules, and the app is slow to respond to taps.

Once a device is configured it works fabulously and Google Assistant and IFTT integration are superb.  Setup though is as slick as sandpaper with long waits where you don't know if it's doing something or it's just hung. The wonderfully short instructions in the packaging suggests that the setup process is so intuitive it doesn't need instructions. It isn't.  I had to Google instructions on a different device to see what I should be doing on the other device and I'm in the IT industry, so not exactly inept with technology. Was disappointed to find the UK switches are without the power monitoring function though as that would be useful.

You can manually turn the light on and off,  use the Wemo app on your smart phone to turn the light on/off or set rules such as turn on at sunset,  off at midnite.

Difficult setup. Paging away from the app to review documentation or alter phone settings, as recommended by the app, causes it to restart. I have so far been​ unable to associate it with Alexa. You get two or three chances to free-text-enter your network's SSID and your device's MAC address after which you're locked out for ten minutes. UA text says to get this from the hardware info in the app, but that page won't load.  I'm on my fifth attempt. The UI provides me with no clue why it is failing. This isn't the app's native UI, but it is part of an ecosystem that is required to function inorder to get utility out of my connected device and it just isn't working.

Great hardware, but the app is truly awful. I dread switching networks or having to add a new switch or bulb. It can take hours of messing around. It fails to connect to switches during set up, then randomly fails to recognise devices. Updates haven't fixed the fundamental issues. I've spent almost an hour trying to get it to recognise a single switch; and now it can't see any of the bulbs. Once you have the painful setup process complete, search for a different app to control all your WeMo devices. They seem to work fine, so I've no idea why this one continues to be so utterly useless.

I've got a smart home and tons of devices, including the Belkin HD Cam (That's wasn't fun setting back up either, but at least it worked after a couple tries) There was a new firmware update for the WeMo and that may have lead to some of my issues, but Idk. I think if these firmware updates are as important as they claim, maybe Belkin should push notifications about them.

The switches work great once they are set up but the app and support sucks. You will get used to a circling waiting symbol and end up force quitting the app to make it go away. When you first set up you have to turn off Wifi scanning on your phone. However the instructions are for an old version of Android and don't work with new versions. I have a Pixel​ so it's not like I have a weird version of Android. Also, I accidentally mistyped my Wi-Fi password (it's complex) and the app notified me but wouldn't let me change it because no Wi-Fi networks would show up in it. I suggest if you have any problems to uninstall and reinstall the app, sometimes multiple times. I think Belkin is one of those companies that only cares about iPhones and Android is just an afterthought. Or they are trying too hard to automate everything and it's just not working right.

If using while on local network insight switch status is reported incorrectly. When turn on or off they just turn to disconnected. Over cellular seems to be ok. I have tasker set to turn off wifi when wemo app open just to combat this. Occasionally this screws with streaming from phone. Please fix this issue as it has been around forever. I will not purchase anymore wemo products until it is fixed. And no I won't reset my switches and reinstall the app for the umpteenth time which is all wemo support say. 17.7.17 tried to delete some rules and couldnt. Repeatly tried.

So far everything has worked well. I've had my switches for over 1 year and they work well even from remote locations. Maybe the difference is I have a very very good router and Internet speed. I just bought the cameras and they are working well also. Make sure you have a good router with good reach.

Pros: Sometimes works.  Cons: 1. Very unreliable.  At time you turn the switch on and it tells you that its but it isn't.  2. If the power goes off and on or the Internet is disconnected for a seconds, the device is likely not to operate and you actually have no way of knowing if it has worked or not unless you're sitting next to it. 3. The device (wemo switch) makes a high pitch whistling sound which is already giving me a headache. I can't have this in my home.  4. Once connected to power takes a couple of minutes to connect to the same wifi to which it was connected 5 minutes ago. (Seriously which technology are you guys using? ) I should tell you that I have got the latest wemo switch, the latest wemo app and have fully upgraded the firmware. Belkin guys, if you wanna make an improvement, the most important aspect is reliability. These devices are no good unless they can report their on/off status 100% accurate. Also do something about the whistling noise.  I have checked two devices and they both had the same issue. I'm returning this for good.

Hi, installed 2 different wemo links that used to work. Reset the links, reset the light bulbs, restarted my android and reinstalled the Android app 5 times each. Right after finishing the set up, it works for 10 seconds then the app forgets everything and goes back to the first help screen again. I am guessing the app is faulty. Any help would be appreciated. This is an expensive joke for $100! A very slow joke! How about having this on two phones? Only one person can not have the keys? Hit and miss and not reliable, sometimes it says something is off or on but it is wrong! Why? The hardware is yours which you charged us more than $100 for it, the software is yours too and you can not make them work together!  By the time it gets loaded I can catch a taxi, go to airport, board a plane, go home, switch off the lights, make sure it is off, and come back! Using this at home? Forget about it, just turn off the switch manually. According to Google 0.5 million to 1 million people downloaded this, let's say also 1 million IPhone users downloaded this. Let's say a quarter of those bought more than one, maybe 2, 3, 4 or more for their business or home. It makes up to $300 million product! Let's say $200 million product from a company who earns billions. And you still managed to make it as useless as possible. Well done.  And don't you see I gave you one star, stop asking please!

Setup instructions are not straightforward and out of date.  Remote access feature does NOT work. Devices can only be controlled at home. Hardware info screens freezes the app. A firmware update which froze the application cleared all Insight data.  Away mode settings displays that my WeMo is enabled to turn on and off at a schedule but I can't disable or delete it because it says I must select a device! However that is because it is the default view for no schedule! Very poor user experience throughout the application.  Turning the WeMo Insight on or off via the application frequently causes it to lose communication with the device. I couldn't figure out what would make it work again but it seems to resume working after several minutes. But it also stops working once I issue another on/off command again. This is a very poor experience.   Unless someone from Belkin can help me, I'm almost certain I am returning my WeMo Insight to Belkin to buy another brand's smart outlet device due to so many atrocious issues in just the first hour.
