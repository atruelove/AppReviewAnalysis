App:  Nest 

Great app untill now. Last update turned the app useless for both indoor and outdoor cameras. Both timelines say no events, and you can't scroll to view the video because the display cuts out when you scroll. I also have purchased nest aware  for both cameras, for the price of the cameras and subscription it should be expected to have a quality app interface. I will be looking for a better setup until nest gets some smarter engineers building their app and would suggest you do the same.

Ok app for Protect but very laggy for Cam Outdoor using timeline,  no timeline in landscape mode,  would like to be able to swipe left/right to skip x amount of time,  this limits to increments of 15secs by pressing,  and why can't we pause the stream? Also would like to have a custom notification sound. Bluetooth not always closing when shutting app now. More problems with footage freezing now on Oreo OS,  impossible to watch feeds now with it freezing after 10secs

Since last 2 updates to the app my Bluetooth will turn on randomly when I'm not even using the app. Never had this issue prior to 2 previous updates. Uninstalled app and issue was gone. Reinstalled and it came back.  Samsung S7 and Samsung A8 both on Nougat 7.0. Please address issue. Thank you

Initially have this review 1 year ago. Still hasn't improved. The lack of a better interface, data analysis capacity and spotty recognition of whether I'm home or not by device leave it nearly impossible to give credence to their power savings claims. Seemingly by intent.   Not being able to log my usage over time is ridiculous. No meaningful historicity is available. Why sell a product to tech savvy people and not allow analytics?

Well done Nest, you fixed the 'black screen when rotating from landscape to portrait' for approximately 14 days! 15 November 2017 update breaks it again. It was great to have it working for one update - nearly two whole weeks! I don't play the lottery any more, I get my thrills from updating the Nest app and placing bets on which features are broken this time.

UPDATE 11/17/17: THEY ADD NEW FEATURES FOR NEW PRODUCTS BUT DO NOT FIX USEABLITY OF THE UI FOR NEST CAMERA.  This app is being used for the outdoor cameras. This app is maddeningly cumbersome. Useablity, on rewinding, rotating  screen to see content skips to different time events. Talk back is barely functional due to lag, interface not responding and major lag on Mic shutting off in time to hear persons response assuming you can get it to work. They need to get someone to real world test this app because it's a message for cameras. I believe it functioned better before an update but not sure. I suspect Ring is a better product. Nest needs to fix this app for the camera as it's functionality as a security camera is not working in real-time 2-way device. More stars will be earned if they can get their act together.

Just had new boiler and central heating installed and elected to have three zones and water controlled by 3 nest thermostats. What a waste of money the water heating requires me to manually turn it on since the schedule doesn't work. The central heating can't be controlled. The android app is a disaster what a rubbish interface when you have to change from portrait to landscape on different pages! I was sold a device to control the heating and it can't. I don't have and would not get any more nest products after this one, why try to be clever and include all the other c**p if you can't get the basic functionality right.

Please enable a voice interaction with Google Assistant so that I can say "OK Google, set Nest to Away" or "set Nest to Home" and have the app respond appropriately.

Woo hoo! At last they've updated the UI so that when the hot water is on that icon and corresponding set of pages turns orange too (similar to heating). Thank you.

Though I have three nest cameras and a thermostat, the app leaves much to be desired. I have a note 5 and this app crashes constantly. If I try to turn my phone from portrait to landscape, my phone crashes. If I try to zoom in, my phone crashes. If I try to view the time line to see pictures of events, it is slow to respond and if I try to view any footage, it lags or crashes. This only happens with this app. It's unfortunate since the app is where you view footage that the camera catches. Without a good app, the cameras are kind of useless. What good are the cameras if I can't playback footage?

The update on October 24, 2017 (v 5.16.0.35) made the app not work on my WiFi with the firewall on.  It works fine on mobile data or if the firewall is disabled.  A chat with Gabriel M on November 4, 2017 confirmed the diagnosis.  A new port request must have been added.  Allowed ports are 53, 80, 443, 993, 4500, 123, 995, 22, 35, and 465.

The app does what you expect but it's very laggy and unresponsive at times.

What a badly designed app. It turns on bluetooth amd leaves it on, and there is no way to disable it.   Firstly, it is bad policy to turn on bluetooth without asking for permission from user, even if you need it for technical reasons.   Secondly, you are invading user privacy, and causing inconvenience.  When the protects are connected via network, why are you using Bluetooth. At the minimum ask the user if they need the app to talk to protects using bluetooth, or are they just trying to set temperature.   And why doesnt ANDROID allow user to decide if an app should be able to turn on or off bluetooth. Probably because sneaky companies are using bluetooth beacons to track user location without giving the user an option to disable that.

What the hell happened in the last week or two? I have schedules for both heat and cool. My heat schedule keeps disappearing and uses the cool schedule instead. This causes it to heat my house to 73 when I want 68.  Previous review (still has same problems)  You can only have one phone  per account. Are you freaking kidding me? Also, you can get history about the past week, but not the current day? The temperature in the house is three degrees above what the Nest is set to and I have to wait until tomorrow to see if it was running?

As of 2017/10/08, this app is useless. Notifications are constant as home/away detection is non-existent. I had to remove my wearable as it was just constantly vibrating.

As helpful as this app should be, it keeps showing an error with connecting to Google. An update to fix this would be great and would definitely increase my review. Also, iPhones have a feature that shows the time strip when viewing the video horizontally (full screen). Unfortunately this feature isn't included for the Android version, which is very very bothersome! Please fix the issues connecting to Google and add a time strip to the full screen video and it'd be a 5-star app!

Used to be so much better.  Now it's unresponsive and changes made in the app do not appear on the thermostat.

Love the overall functionality of the thermostat but HATE the interface and method for adjusting the temperature schedule, especially for Heat/Cool. Why can't that also be arrows like the main screen or even by typing in temps? The slider is maddening, particularly because in Heat/Cool it tends to jump and is difficult to set both temps less than 5 or so degrees apart.  At a minimum why can't ready temp be adjusted independently without the other moving at random?

Thermostat is nice except one thing...can't run the fan unless heat or cool is on.  With my original unit, I'm used to running my fan all day long to circulate the air in my home - whether I'm heating, or cooling, or not.  I'm SO annoyed that I can't do that with this new smart unit.  If I shut off the heat or air conditioning with this Nest unit, the fan shuts off.  There needs to be a standalone fan option that can be activated.

Umm.. pausing video is a necessity. I know it used to be there​ in-between the back and forward buttons (or just tapping the screen) it's not there now. Also, when saving clips, the clips do not include the original time stamps, which is kinda really important. Someone attempted to gain entry to my house and the video clip I was trying to send to the police had absolutely no date/time or any context. It makes things REALLY confusing and near impossible to determine the order of things when you are comparing video clips between 2 different cameras. Come on guys. Also the app is really laggy when clicking on an "event" in portrait mode then switching to landscape, the video cuts out and you miss the event. Also since last update when I slide my finger along the video theres no time lapse. We all spend sooo much monthly for these little features that aren't little the are necessary.  Update: Reinstalled the app, which fixed the issue with time lapse. The rest of my issues remain. Update 2: Time lapse randomly stopped working again.

Needs a home screen widget.  Addition of a 30 or 60 min "boost" for heating would be useful (regardless of temperature).

On both the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S8 to menu buttons are near impossible to use.  I have to push the buttons many times for them to even bring up their respective menus like Heat/Cool/Off or Fan.  In addition I think one of the firmware updates to the Nest changed how it siphons power from the wires if not using a Common wire causing it to damage a relay in my HVAC circuit board.  The repair was over $1,000.  Beware!

Why show the set temp as the larger view and the actual temp teeny tiny. You know what you've set it at but you don't know the actually temp and that should be the bigger and the 1st you see.

Clean UI, but lacks configuration options for viewing nest cams.  I'm one of many people using multiple cams as a baby monitors. Spaces view is ok but needs features like: 1. No screen time out (only possible when viewing a single camera) 2. Multi-cam audio - this should be simple, just mix the audio from all, raising the volume on individual cams when new noises are heard.  Add in more features and I'll rate it higher.

I bought this product on the strength of the AutoAway feature so that when me and my wife were out of the house it wouldn't needlessly heat the home. It worked last winter pretty well, but since having the heating coming on regularly this winter it's been utterly appalling. I've done every reset and setting change advised on the website but it won't recognise when we have left. There's clearly a problem with the app as Google knows where I am to such a startling degree it can ask how my visit to the supermarket was and track my movements on the Google Maps timeline. The app tells me how it hasn't heard from my phone for a few days.... I don't know how it can be so misinformed. It doesn't even recognise that I am logged into the WiFi at work, which would be acceptable. I bought Nest over Hive due to the close links with Google. I paid a not insubstantial  cost for the device and an additional fee for installation. Now this issue has started without the rapid solutions I would have expected from a Google associated company I feel pretty duped as the product does not  deliver on its selling point. If had my time again I would buy Hive and will be recommending the same to my colleagues.

While video quality is good,  the app is terrible.    On my tablet it is glitchy .  The blue circle keeps spinning in the middle of my image.  I am unable to review video from earlier in the day.  The time line feature will not load.  On my phone when  I'm trying to review a video from earlier in the day and I tap on the screen the  forward or reverse option randomly appears. It's a pain in the ass to try and review any video.  The time line is too sensitive. It drives me crazy. And I'm paying for the 10 day cloud recording.   Thinking about canceling unless the application gets better.

Decent enough application; Gets the job done for what it is at the moment.    However, I'm really disappointed that the ability to add others is an all or nothing premise, still, after all this time.    I'd love to see the ability to actually have the "owner" account be able to assign each connected device individually as well as just what actions they are able to perform with the device(s).    Having everyone with God Mode isn't very encouraging to add others with when you've now just automatically allowed them to effectively delete the account and all devices... when I may have just wanted to give them a range of temperatures they can set between a certain time on certain days, for example.

This app sucks. Constantly fiddling with the damn thing. When I go into a single camera view and hit forward or backwards, 9 times out of 10 the stupid thing will jump to either the most current stream or some random spot in the history. It takes multiple tries and tons of patience to finally get it to work right... if it ever works right. Often I just give up.  Also, the recognition algorithm sucks. Always getting false person alerts or no alerts at all when a person is actually there. I mean I guess it's great that my video history is all in the cloud somewhere if and when I need it, but viewing anything meaningful in this app is a lesson in futility... Samsung Galaxy S7.

The app and the camera both work well.

For a Google owned company, these omissions are disappointing.

This app uses a phone to switch the thermostat mode, predicting one's coming home. Unfortunately, it's extremely buggy, for it switches the thermostat to the home mode even if one is out of state or as far as in another country.

It does not learn (will turn on to bump temp by 0.5 degree without consideration that temperature outside will go up in 30 minutes. People love it as it's expensive.

App was working fine until recently, the video scrubbing is a bit clunky to find when activity has been noticed in a zone, but it was manageable.   The current issue that's been persisting for a few days now, is duplicate notifications occurring throughout the day for the same activity.   I've reinstalled the app twice and all that succeeded in doing was giving me triple notifications instead of double. More than a bit annoying, so hopefully get fixed soon.

Their thermostats still list "efficiency" through a green leaf based on previous temp settings.  According to their spokespeople, these have nothing to do with exterior temperatures, which are a REQUIREMENT for any real efficiencies (estimated or not). Simply figure out the heat transfer rates based on how often the system has to cycle on and off with a specific exterior temperature.       Also, why the heck isn't there any graph of temperature history, let alone one that compares interior to exterior temperature over the course of a month??  Don't you think I'd like to see the effects of added insulation in the attic?   As for their cameras, it's a huge engineering oversight to have the internal IR illumination source always on with the night vision, make it a user switchable function.

Interface is nice. Works fine. I consistently have issues with touch feedback more so than with other apps. I have to tap around the numbers to select the high or low temperature. I have to keep tapping to select the zone I want to change. I'm not sure if it's just slow at processing the feedback or the sensitivity is off or the active area I need to touch is just that small. But it is slightly annoying.  Now that I have Nest outdoor cameras, I feel the UI is pretty terrible. I try to slide up and down to scrub time and it doesn't work at least half the time. Trying to expand to full screen doesn't work often. The tactile feedback is pretty erratic and annoying. But the single solution through Nest is enough that I'm sticking with it until something better comes along.

In regards to the indoor nest cam... The 15sec rewind/forward is kind a garbage. Going back and forth to watch what was previously recorded in general is not great. All n all though... I love the nest cam. It does a good job recording moments of sound and movement. There's a lag in notifying me to when it happens..So, if I get a notification I know that it's not real time...

Update: womp womp.. Camera randomly turns on even though it it set to "Home" and I'm home! Back to ****  Update: geofencing finally worked! Thank you! 5 stars!   Previous version: 4 stars because I can't rate 3.5 stars. Reasons being:  1. I had to use my laptop to set up the camera coz the app wouldn't/can't recognize the camera. It also took a while on my laptop (Mac) because it didn't automatically start like what were usually used to. I think what caused the installation issue on the app is that my router has two frequencies and the nest cam takes a different one over my phone..? I dunno.. But anyway, I got it to install and it's all good now. ☺ 2. Geofencing does not work. It's a small issue. I only have to manually tell the app that I'm either home or away. But it would be nice if it worked and does the switching over for me.  Other than those two issues, I love the camera! Does exactly what I want and need it to do. I got the camera because my fire alarms at home set off for no reason while I'm at work.

Looking for camera replacement even after I invested into nest cameras over $1,000 and pay them monthly plus another $1,000 for thermostats and nest protects. They can't get the app to work... terrible!

I  now for some reason get double notifications for every little thing the camera sees!awesome when it goes off in the middle of the night so then MY phone goes off twice,  and my WIFE'S phone goes off twice!  And it no longer can distinguish people from regular motion,  which is one of the reasons i bought this camera in the first place! Please fix!

The latest update broke my activity zone notifications. I tried removing and reinstalling all my cameras and it's still messed up. Customer service was no help resolving the issue. I hope a future update fixes it.  Edit #1: I finally discovered (on my own) what the issue is. Unless you have "person seen" activated, you will not get notifications in an activity zone when someone walks by. With this option turned off, you will only get notifications for motion. For example: a bird flying by or waving your hand directly in front of the camera. This is extremely unfortunate for people who only want person seen notifications in specific activity zone instead of in the entire camera's field of vision. For example: a camera pointing outside where people regularly walk by, but you are only interested in notifications in a specific zone. The only other option is to turn on "person seen" and get a million notifications throughout the day and hope that one of them is within the activity zone you actually care about. I really hope they fix this so "person seen" is a unique option for each activity zone instead of the camera overall. Currently, it's a broken feature. Edit #2: still no good feedback from Nest on how to solve the notification issues. I've had to "hack" my cameras by smudging/dirtying the lens making the video quality blurry. This tricks the camera into not recognizing if a person walks in an activity zone. Instead, it only sees it as motion which results in the notifications I want. Pretty sad that I have to do this in order to get a simple feature to work. Edit #3: I unsubscribed from Nest Aware since there is still an issue with motion alerts and person alerts. No point in throwing away money.

What's the use of have the Nestaware service if I get a notification 10 minutes latter that a person is at the door.

Interface is nice. Works fine. I consistently have issues with touch feedback more so than with other apps. I have to tap around the numbers to select the high or low temperature. I have to keep tapping to select the zone I want to change. I'm not sure if it's just slow at processing the feedback or the sensitivity is off or the active area I need to touch is just that small. But it is slightly annoying.  Now that I have Nest outdoor cameras, I feel the UI is pretty terrible. I try to slide up and down to scrub time and it doesn't work at least half the time. Trying to expand to full screen doesn't work often. The tactile feedback is pretty erratic and annoying. But the single solution through Nest is enough that I'm sticking with it until something better comes along.

Live video quality is comparable to Lyric and ZModo. Not any better, not any worse. The only way to get any recorded video is with a paid monthly subscription! Sure wish they made that clear before buying it. The schedule feature only turns the camera on and off, not the notifications. Why do I need a notification that I just walked in front of the camera while at home? Also when at 'Home' the camera recording is completely turned off. Hey Nest, ever heard of a HOME INVASIONS? Yes s#it does happen when people are at home and are relying on the camera to capture it. This app/camera is missing all the little features that actually give the user security and comfort.

Everyone would cry the app never updates, or cry when something wrong happens.  No one's every happy.  That's the point of feedback.   Again, I think the app works great.  Can see the camera feed, adjust house temp.   About nest cameras.  They tell you that it requires a decent speed Wi-Fi connection and to test locations to make sure your happy with the feed.  I have 2 routers in my house, 1 for the cameras and a few upstairs things and 1 for the basement stuff.  So when reading reviews and comments , be sure to wonder if common sense was used or just someone crying cause they aren't happy.

This app is garbage and even worse with latest update. Like it was never even tested. Dropcam app has always been better. I read an article about the original developer and how he regrets ever selling the company because of how Google/Nest have completely neglected the platform. The new group is only interested in sales and has zero interest in supporting and improving the products beyond that. I have witnessed the decline in quality and service from Dropcam and am moving on. Disgusting to have the resources they do and not to utilize them by hiring good people to support their products/customers and by not investing in obviously needed improvements. Just read the real reviews, the ones that have similar complaints. The 5 star reviews with zero details are obviously created by Nest to boost their score...and how sad that they can't get above a measly 4.0. There is no way that this app is working well enough for anyone to rate it above a 1. Like I said, it's garbage. How anyone can feel good about working on this app and for this company is amazing. I would be too embarrassed to tell anyone where I worked.

I called customer "service," and they verified that it doesn't work properly.

Reasons not to buy nest cams: you have no control over notifications, they believe that their "smart" notifications are all you need even though you're paying the bill. Second, you literally need gaming quality internet or your picture will be worthless. I can't make out faces that are 7 or more feet away.

Beyond horrible. Where to start, app functionality leaves a lot to be desired. Sometimes the options work and sometimes they don't. Add in the fact the company wants to bend you over and go to town on you for a subscription is nothing short of horrific. A cloud save is an amazing service that provides a backup.

1. Please add notifications, like if the pin is entered incorrectly 2. Let us to set the amount of time before it dims/turns the display off 3. Add a timer option so I can set it to turn on/off in X amount of time 4. Allow us to set the schedule to turn it on/off 5. Allow us to set auto-away to "on" for the less tech savvy people so all they have to do is walk by the Nest to end away so they get A/C or heat 6. Add a lock icon on the home screen and main screen of the Thermostat so we know it's locked 7. Please add a timer for whichever setting we put it on for x amount of time 8. For the family member, please make it so we can choose who can access what on the Nest Thermostat and allow us to only let them change the temperature if they choose to 9.

Love the app. But there is something I would like to see changed, as I encountered a issue during the holiday. Is there a possibility during the next upgrade to have the option to turn a nest protect module off. Because we had one nest protect module hone haywire when we were on holiday and not the option to shut it off. I can understand that this can be an obnoxious sound for our neighbors when this occurs at night or during the weekend.

Works well. Sometimes, I have to tap twice to open what I want to open, or do what I want to do.  That's a minor inconvenience. I'd love to have the temperature history available. Perhaps on a graph with the outside temperature.  Additionally I think it'd be good to see when the fan ran in the energy usage graph. Not just the heating and cooling. All in all, a functional app.
compound: 0.8934, neg: 0.033, neu: 0.75, pos: 0.217,

Continual app crashes when tapping on video notifications or when choosing live video. Renders notifications worthless since it crashes everytime. I've tried the stock response to uninstall/reinstall with no resolution. This really makes the camera unusable.

Very irritating functionality.  I have two of these thermostats in my home.  Three months running and I've discovered that Home/Away assist is totally broken which is the backbone of Nest's energy saving system.  I've figured out that you must deactivate the thermostats activity sensors for home/away assist in order for the thermostats to go to 'away' mode using just the cell phone location when you leave the home.  If you don't, the sensors always 'sense' activity and keep them in home mode. I have no pets or any other factors that cause movement when we aren't home.  Second big issue as of late: both thermostats randomly drop offline and I cannot see them from the app (Android). This is a new problem and I have changed nothing on my network so...  Yeah, irritating.  Glad I got them on sale and stacked 10% off coupons at Lowe's because these aren't worth retail price. I wish that I didn't have to have every shiny new tech toy that came out.  Disappointed.

I'm on a Samsung S8+, and this app regularly crashes. When looking at a camera shot in full screen, in landscape, the picture remains zoomed in, cutting off ~25% of the screen. Scrolling through video history is terrible. After finding what you want to view, when you release your finger, the video jumps to a random time left or right. Finally, trying to navigate video using the arrows results in the video restarting from the same time position repeatedly. Video operation in this app is critical, and terribly executed. This is almost enough to make me sell my cameras and abandon Nest entirely.

Needs more settings. Like length of time to run fan after AC shuts off. Or settings for 1st and 2nd stage heating times. Every hone is different and I feel like their algorithms are not diverse enough for the heating / Cooling needs of different homes in different parts of the US.

I like the look of the app, but why does it take several touches before it registers what you are trying to select, almost have to press down with pressure on the screen. I have 2 Galaxy S8s, and on both I have to press down on the screen several times to select any option.

Using the app as a baby monitor with a WiFi cam, it has always been very accurate and helpful when compared to other brands with the same function.  Although there will occasionally be a lag in notifications, or a break in wifi connectivity, the app is consistently diligent about notifying us, whether home or away, that there has been movement or sound in our son's room.  We can rely on it to keep us in the know, and with recent updates it has become even more user friendly.  Both initial setup and use throughout have remained nearly effortless, and though we have opted for the free version (rather than pay monthly for premium Nest coverage) we did not experience a loss in quality.  Highly recommended.

This app sucks.  Product is great.  But you can change the account owner once its established.  I had to call my ex-wife (actual recommendation from NEST support) who I haven't spoken to in years, because NEST support couldn't figure out how to switch me from a "family member" to the "account owner" even though the house is in my name only (ex-wife moved into my place), the electric bill is in my name, and I bought and installed the thermostat. All she did was set the account up online.  Stupid that NEST support, after 2 ph calls and 3hrs of talking, can't click a button on their end to change the account owner, but I can control the temp in my condo while I'm in another country!  Wow...poor customer service.

When my nest thermostat is set to cool it randomly gets stuck in a loop of turning the blower motor on and off. Opening the app, without changing any settings, magically stops the cycling but only temporarily. Eventually i need to turn it off just to keep it from doing that.

I have different sets of passwords for different accounts with different levels of securities.

I know it's "just tech" but I kinda want it faster than what it is. 6-10 second delay from the time my doorbell is pressed, to the time I'm alerted from the app is too long! Not to mention the person entered the frame 2 seconds prior pressing bell! And of course, it's always the other guys fault. It's the wifi network, it's the cell company, and I shouldn't expect more. But I do. I would have invested into hardwired system if Nest advertised that it takes 6-10 seconds. Other than the delays, they system is great! The app is well built. $10/mth for 1 camera is steep, $15 for 2 is crazy. There is another company selling 10+ cams for $100/year!! All this on top of hearing Alphabet was trying to sell Nest! Not leaving me feeling very confident in my investment of 3 cams, 1 therm, and 6 protects! I shouldnt have stayed loyal and went to Z-wave!

I've tried rebooting the phone, logging out and back in, wiping the app data and cache, and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Without the app the Nest products are basically useless. I just bought some more cameras and they're now useless.

For the love of God please fix the Android TV app. It only works the first time you sign in and if you close the app it never works again until you sign out and sign back in again. I have spoken to customer support who had no clue what I was talking about. I have an Nvidia shield TV and a mi box and it does this on both.   I have bought 3 nest cameras at $200 a pop and would like ALL of the functionality please. There seems to be ZERO urgency to fix this and this is why I don't buy more Google products. I can't believe I'm going to say this but if this were an Amazon product this would have been fixed because they care about their customers.

The fan recirculating option could be better programmed. When you set the fan to be on 15 minutes each hour it turns on for the 15 minutes each hour then the air is stagnant for the next 45 minutes. A more efficient and effective method would having the ability to had the fan on for 5 minutes every 15 minutes. This would be a more evenly of recirculating the air. I know I can set to be after 30 or 45 minutes an hour but that's a waste electricity and the nest supposed to conserve energy

There are so many more cheaper home security options out there, some that don't even require a monthly subscription, that has me ended up selling my cameras. I will miss the person detection feature but at a cost of $10 a month is ridiculous. I have two cameras already. $10 should be for at least two cameras a month. With it's poor video quality, long delay and horrible app it just confuses me as to why I chose this in the first place. Why can't I set a custom ringtone for each camera let alone the app? Don't you think that it is important that it should sound different then my email notifications? Why is rewinding and fast forwarding so cumbersome and slow? Why is there no back up SD card?

Last two updates broke connection to Nest on PixelXL. All of my iOS devices still work. Shouldn't Nest be testing Google devices first being they're owned by the same parent company? (Nest and Google under Alphabet)  Frankly this is embarrassing for Nest as a company. First break the app, then release an update that doesn't fix anything. How about we don't use paying customers as beta testers? Many people have invested large amounts of money for Nest to get it right. Without a functioning app, the $300 nest thermostat is no better than the $30 it replaced, and the cameras are all near useless.

The app is beautifully designed.  One of my favorite apps to use, it's a shame that with voice and all the automatic things that happen, I don't see the app very often.  One feature that would be nice I think would being able to customize the Protect notification vibrate pattern and sound.  I was in a meeting at work and didn't realize that my smoke detector went off until I was out of the meeting.  Because it was the same vibration pattern as normal sms notifications I didn't know it was important to see it right away. Luckily my wife was just making breakfast and burnt some food but if it wasn't her then my house might have been gone.  Now that I type this I guess I could make a ifttt or Stringify flow for a more aggressive alert but still, I'd be nice to have in app.

The app is great when it works correctly. The nest home aware function hasn't worked properly since the update to nougat on my Samsung s7. I made sure it has location permissions. Most of the time the camera doesn't turn on when away from home, and when you are home it will turn on and off sporadically.  Is there a fix - or at least a workaround? I shouldn't have to babysit the app/camera to see if it's working, especially since I've used it without problems for 3+ years.

Very poor tools for scanning video history. In portrait orientation you get a sliding timeline at the bottom. This is keyed by stills of the start of a motion event. You can tap on it and let it play, or attempt to scan around by sliding up or down on this timeline - but this is hugely AWKWARD - very gross motion. Needs a "find next motion" button or fast forward 2x, 3x, 4x mode. Then as you get close, you accidentally tilt it landscape and you lose your location. I'm much more annoyed than I sound.

Poss glitch: The app generally works fine for me with the thermostat however today i went to add our new protect smoke alarm but the QR scanner would not adjust focus, even when i tapped the screen, therefore would not scan. I had to manually input the code and link to the smoke alarm. Could be an app issue?

Long press on icon brings the same cameras twice. No more notifications when camera goes offline because of internet/electrical issues or if someone just unplugs it(this seems necessary for security reasons). Video history looks good. Missing the on/off easy access. Now you need to go an extra menu to turn off camera.

This product could be a great thing if they would make it a little more intuitive. If you turn your AC on using your app or the thermostat itself even 1 minute before the schedule is set to trigger, it will still go with the schedule. Also, it constantly goes to eco mode and turns off your AC. In central Texas, this feature is terrible. I am in a constant fight with this software, often times having to manually turn my AC back on 10 to 15 times in just a couple of hours in order to get my house cool when I get home. It's a complete waste of technology.

The device isn't responsive. It takes it own sweet time to turn off after you've told it to stop cooling/heating. They could make it better in this respect but idk why they don't. For the expensive price of these things they should. User clicks to turn off(turn down/up temp) it shouldn't take three to five minutes to turn off. Technology today can handle this. Really

Something has recently changed.  App now catches all activities instead of only when not home.  Usually have two or three person spots from coming home at lunch and after work, now it is recording every single time someone crosses camera.

What I know.... This app goes to black screen when I rotate my phone   to full screen and only plays the audio sometimes.  It also when loses it's timeline, say I select an event to view then turn the phone to full screen it won't be where I was on the timeline.... Very annoying. Also my camera is in a low signal area but does record fine, few times I'd be looking at my phone/nest history videos, when I go back the app claims my phone was offline when I know I was reviewing videos at that time. Then it's fine again. Doesn't sent notifications 100% of the time. It will have a video saved if I look in the app but no notifications during.... Would suck to be robbed/invaded that one time it doesn't notify us.   Wife's phone doesn't even show her an image next to the videos recorded. She only sees a dot and has to play a video just to see a person, mine shows a dot and an image of the person usually.   Really buggy app in my opinion and needs work.

Phone notifications are hit and miss. Turn "person seen" to on and I get notified of people outside of alert zones. Turn it off and it rarely notifies me of people stood at my door, the orange blocks appear in my timeline though (I always get a notification if the wind blows a few leaves around!)  Still Present Annoying bug : Open the app via a camera notification, then close it using the home button. Open the app normally and it goes straight back to the camera notification. Every time. Until you swipe close it.

Great quality app, but really needs configurable notifications.  A detection of a person by the camera is really important, but no way to select a sound and/or vibration pattern for that event.  Also the on/off control is too simple. Would like to have the cameras on overnight, even while home.

S7 Edge. Nougat update trashed this app on this phone. Maybe not the app but the functionality of Nest, cam to be specific. Home/Away assist is very unstable since Nougat and that is how we preferred to utilize our cam. Samsung or Google's fault? Who knows but it's annoying. Isn't it annoying that things sometimes work great until they push an update. Sometimes they help but it just seems all to common that the opposite is true. Nest worked perfect before update. Now it is just annoying and has become more of a troubleshooting waste of time for the last couple months. These tech experts too, Seriously? Or senior engineers? Lol! The titles for these people are funny. I'm pretty sure I'm qualified as an expert now. I can't build the camera but I sure can get around this software better than they can sometimes. Yes, I'm disappointed. I've been patient. And now I've spend hundreds of dollars and many hours troubleshooting to no prevail. Oh, they gave me 20 bucks credit. That covers the cost of gas when driving around town troubleshooting home/away assit.    Sincerely,   First World Problem

Why is it so hard to develop something simple and useful? Its machine learning is terrible! There has to be manual mode so that I can at least control it the way I like it... When i set it to a certain temparature I would like it to stay that at that temparature. Every night I keep waking up freezing because the thermostat wants me to freeze to death. Even though all the learning, schedule and Stay/Away settings are off it still does change the temp. It's frustrating... Also I tried Stay and Away statuses and never worked.

I'm giving Nest a 3 for a few reasons. But first, nest works as specified by its company,  so no complaints there. The problem is that nest seems to battle integrating with other eco systems like smarthings hub, which is fine if Google had an alternate solution for comprehensive home automation, but the don't!   I hate that there are no remote temperature sensors, I hate that the entire nest ecosystem seems incoherent... without a smart hub nest is just missing a big piece. I hate that nest just doesn't play nice with other commonly uses smart devices.  I am holding my home automation for a while because I am a loyal Google customer, but I'm losing hope,  and with ecobee kicking nests a**, I am thinking about dropping my plans of a Google line up of automation and going the ecobee/Amazon path. Pleas prove me wrong with your next line of product releases, you are losing market share, and you need a real breakthrough

Really poor connectivity, and non-intuitive setup and troubleshooting if the system doesn't work PERFECTLY from the get go.

The Logi Circle is better! I bought both at the same time but expected the Nest Cam to be superior because of its higher cost. I've found the Nest Cam to be inferior in several different aspects but I'll focus the app here.  The Nest app is terribly unintuitive and badly designed for a company owned by alphabet/google.   Problem 1: I can't scrub through the sightline to a specific time. The app will mislead you into thinking that you can since you can drag the blue marker line to a specific time, but once you let go, the video will skip forward or backward to the beginning or end of whatever Nest decides is the activity event. This means I'll waste a bunch of time trying to get closer and closer to a certain event before realizing the app won't let me go to a specific time. Then I'll give up and waste my life starting from the beginning of whatever they decide is the start of the activity. For example, I might know that a specific event happened right around 10:32:50, but I'll only be able to start watching from 10:30:00 because Nest might decide that that was the start of the activity. I can't skip right to the action. Problem 1.5: After wasting a bunch of time watching activity I'm not interested to get to the meat, I accidentally discovered you can speed up this process by touching the video. When you touch the screen, little button overlays will show up that will allow you to go backwards or forwards 15 seconds. It's still imprecise and you still waste time having to watch activity you're no interested in of you have a specific time in mind. This is also unintuitive. Why would I randomly decide to touch the above video playback while I'm trying to use the sightline below to scrub through the recordings? Terrible design.  Problem 2: If I decide to save a clip, I don't know what I'm getting until I press the save/share button (the icon is also badly designed... it should be a simple downward download arrow, not a freaking right facing arrow). Once I click that button, I'll get a pop up message saying that the clip was added to my nest aware account. Then the next screen shows the clip that was added which is ridiculous because they only show you the clip after you click the save/sharw button. The clip might be 15s long or 1min long. The clip may contain the activity you wanted, or it may not. I don't know how they decide what should be clipped but it's terribly unintuitive and a huge waste of time. For example, if an activity of interest happens around 10:32:50, I might want to save a clip from 10:32:45 to 10:33:30. But I don't get to select the beginning or the end. I don't even get an option to specify that at least a certain time should be included in whatever interval they decide is best. And there's no way for me to pause at 10:32:50 and tap the save button. So I end up tapping the save button while the recording is playing and hope that the part I'm watching gets included in the clip they decide to save. It's not garanteed that the part you're interested will be included since they don't let you specify what you're interested in. Problem 2.5: Further, on this next screen after you click the save button and the message pops up saying the clip was added to your account, there is a "cancel" button option. Cancel what?! I thought the clip was already added to my account. If there is a cancel option, then were is the confirm/continue option? If I press cancel, then does the clip get removed from my account? What happens if I go back on my phone without tapping any of their button? It's unclear.  Problem 3: So you get this message saying that this clip was added to your account, but there is no way for you to actually access your clips on your account on the app. ??? (I think you have to use a computer.)  Problem 4: After you have wasted your life trying to get close to a specific time, you might decide to change your phone orientation. Big mistake! Instead of continuing, the marker skips back to the beginning of the activity clip and you have to waste your life again trying to find the activity at the specific time.

Great camera. The network is awful. I purchased not knowing about the subscription, decided to try it out anyway because of the 30 day trial. First few days awesome. Maybe offline an hour or so throughout the day. 10 minutes here 3 minutes there that sort of thing. Last 2 and a half weeks it's offline more than online! Nothing has changed that I can notice in any other device in the home. I see countless reviews saying the exact same thing, so I know it's not on my end. Great product when it works. I would even settle for live feed with no record than have this. Thanks for the free trial saved me some money by test run. Fix The Network And I Will Purchase More Cameras.

Since upgrading to Android N this app can't tell that I am home so it continually turns off my thermostat and turns on my camera's. When I am away it turns my camera off and thermostat on randomly. I have been talking to nest support for months without any resolution except for the suggestion of uninstalling then installing the app again. I now tell others that they are wasting thier money with nest products and services since the online service costs money for something that never works! At this point I feel that these products are a scam since there are cheaper products on the market that do the same things and let you store recordings for free locally!

The app itself is great. Subscription for Nest Aware is Very Expensive. It's ok for 1 camera but when you add more cameras it looses touch with reality. A more realistic package offer for Nest Aware will earn them the remaining 2 stars.

Nice but...  It would be better if the app would show and retain the running times for heat (aux &amp; normal) and cooling. Right now you can see the overall times but, the scale is to small and not detailed enough to tell when the unit ran during the day. I can tell it ran sometime between 6am and 10am.  Plus unless you actually look at each day it rounds up to the next 15 minutes.  Plus, I am very very disappointed with the monthly report. I quit getting it because I'm tired of reading that I need to set it for 60 to 84 degrees, it ain't gonna happen.

Nest was great in the beginning. Yes it was the first to get to the wireless dance first. They are expensive and​the upkeep isn't cheap if you have a few camera's. But  then when it was acquired by Google it seemed to have lost its shine.. It seems like there's always a hickup every now and then let it be the network is down or the system is not running correctly. And every time my phones have upgraded to the newest Android operating system my Nest aware never works right. I could be home and then two seconds later it says I'm not home then the cameras turn on like they're possessed start recording. It's kind of funny after the WikiLeaks my cameras are turning against me..

Absolutely useless. I gave it three and a half weeks to 'learn' but it simply can't cope with our irregular schedule - it came on at completely random times and heated to way above our normal maximum. Switched to manual schedule but even that stinks - if I set the time it starts much earlier to be at the temp at that time - no, just turn on at that time as there is no way this saves money. Also, my boiler is on the landing outside my bedroom so it wakes me up at ridiculous o'clock. I've now had to remove the morning start up from the schedule. Thankfully it was free from my energy company or I'd be trying to get my money back.

For anyone who is having an issue with their NEST Thermostat since updating to Android Nougat. I may have a resolution?     As of this review, it's been about an hour and so far so good. Since my update, today is the first time I am home on a day off. Today my home started to get really cold. I checked the NEST (not the app) and said I was on ECO. I then checked phone (S7 Edge if it matters any to this issue), and I was away. Which then quickly changed to HOME and started to heat. As soon as I got out of the app and put my phone down, ok walked by and I was on EVO again. Checked phone again, and I was away, then it went back to HOME and started to heat. (PS... I only use the phones location to detect if home since the home sensors keep picking up my cats and think we are home when at work.)    I looked up reviews and saw something about GOOGLE Assistant being on Nougat, So I checked this by pressing and holding the home button on phone and Assistant opened. I followed the tutorial and clicked the 3 dots top right corner, then settings, HOME CONTROL,add device, and there was the NEST. Clicked that and had to sign into NEST account. Now they are linked.     Since I did that... my thermostat is working again and has not switched to ECO while home! If this happens again, I will update and contact NEST but I wonder if with the new update to NOUGAT things are thrown off. Even other apps I use don't remember my phone and have to start fresh each login. Hope this helps at all.

Really Disappointed with this app... Using this app to control my "smart" thermostat... it doesnt tell you the exact times of when the heating has come on and for how long... instead you see a orange line that gives you an approx timings (not accurate) with the number of hours its been on for (e.g monday 2hrs).... im looking for data that more accurate like (heating on from 5pm to 6:45pm total usage 1hr and 45mins).

Used to work fine but since nest have changed to eco the auto-away function doesn't seem to work reliably. When I was 50 miles from home or didn't detect I was away and when you set away on your phone it doesn't work. If you set away on the actual thermostat it works so I wonder what the point is of having the app?! Also it doesn't set the thermostat to home when you get home even though the phone and the thermostat are connected to the same wi-fi. My thermostat won't change to home until I go and touch it...

Great app except for the  scheduling module. You have to add one temperature at at time per day which is horrible. Also when you put the thermostat in away mode, the scheduled temperatures are still followed rather than being ignored. I need to manually remove all the scheduled temperatures before I go into away mode otherwise I don't save since it doesn't go into Eco mode.

Edit: I'm pleased to see Nest has fixed the things I originally complained about. 5 stars!  Pop-up messages over video are terrible and constant. If I tap on full screen view then I don't want to see anything but video until I tap otherwise! The old interface allowed me to scroll through all motion events and had a moving thumbnail for each event which was great. The new interface only shows a single image for just some events making quick event viewing ability much worse than before. I simply can't see all events anymore with this interface which is clunky and imprecise.  Response to vendor: The banner blocks the upper 1/5 to 1/4 of the camera image when it pops up. I bought 3 cameras and 2 Nest Aware subscriptions but I can't stop the pop-ups unless I pay for that third subscription... right. These cameras are becoming more of an iToy than serious security devices.

My only negative comment is regarding the time settings for heat or water. These are in 30 minute increments. It should be possible with future software updates to change time settings by 5 minute increments, giving the user more precise control over scheduling.   Having considered other manufacturers' similar type products, I think this is the best on the market.  I have no hesitation in recommending Nest.

So far so good, couple tweaks would make it better Have the thermostat and 2 outdoor cams so far, adding 3 indoor cams later this week.  Interface is simple and easy to figure out.  Video history seems to work fine with a solid wifi signal and good Internet speed.   Having to use a PC to set zones is kind of a pain, I would think there's a way that could be done in the app.  Also, would be nice to set specific notification sounds just for the Nest app.  I'd rather a distinctive sound for a motion alert than the same sound I get for all of my notifications.

Make a widget I want to see and change the set temperature, see the actual indoor temperature and the true radiant estimation on a widget, make a small version and a large version. I will update the rating when you do that. I hate having to open the app, it's so silly when Android let's me use widgets to make things easier. Google/Android is part of Alphabet. Nest is part of Alphabet. Work together to bring convenience to your customers. A widget will cost little to make and will provide lots of convenience.

Works ok App works decently.  If your connection is not very strong the speaker feature doesn't work very well.   You can press the button to talk and the app keeps loading and works half the time.

An amazingly smart thermostat! I've had a lot of so-called programmable thermostats since the 1980's. The Nest thermostat (Gen 3) is hands down the best thermostat out there now. Everything just works. The only thing could suggest is an option to have an adjustable swing temperature of ½º. It comes with ±1º and is not adjustable. Other than that I have no wants. To be able to control it (easily) via your smart phone is wonderful. LOVE it!

App is unusable. Constantly freezes. Timeline/history in latest release is nearly useless. It's difficult to go to the beginning of motion and very often just goes to a still in the middle of motion with no play button.

The App isn't Compatible with AppStandby if I don't open the app for a month it can't report location. Hello! What kind of Good Home automation device requires user intervention on a regular basis?!

Now there is this awful eco setting which seems to have replaced it. So now I set away and it goes into eco but then randomly comes out of eco mode whilst still being set to away.

Annnnnnnnnndddd it didn't work. I had to go press the physical button on the protect.

The thermostat home/away feature and ECO function works when the algorithm allows and senior reps at NEST cannot explain it. The October 2016 update to the thermostat makes it now incompatible with ADTPulse. The app also disrupts the functionality of LIFX bulbs.

I sat freezing for 2 days waiting for this to get resolved. This morning at 6am I switched it on and it stayed on for 4 hours warming my home up.

Only controls in whole temperature increments Whereas on the Nest itself you can set the temperature very precisely (there are maybe 5  "ticks" within each degree), using this app you can only change whole degrees. It may not sound like a big deal, but in our house with a boiler, it's the difference between "comfortable" and "sweltering". Please add more precision!

Love the cameras, hate the app In the beginning the annoying pop-up banner obstructs the view as it constantly reminds you of when your trial ends. After paying for the service, the pop-up then tells you when billing will begin. Sure you can tap the X, but the message comes right back, obstructing the view again. Scrolling to the correct location on the timeline is not easy. There are no PLAY or PAUSE buttons, only BACK &amp; FORWARD (15 seconds at a time). This makes reviewing the video both difficult and time consuming.

This app is broken as others have mentioned. The heating can't be turned on if we are away from home no matter how hard we try. Even if we manually set it to "home"  it still doesn't come on. It worked fine when we first got it but one of the updates has broken it so now we have a £250 gadget that doesn't work. I would not recommend this product

This is a good app and behaves as expected. My primary issue is that the app covers a portion of the camera's feed with a message about the Nest Aware free trial, even after paying for a subscription. Nest support informed me that I can get rid of the message by cancelling the free trial (and start using my paid subscription) to get rid of the message. I'd give the app four stars, but the annoyance of blocking my video drops my rating by one star.

Nest was acquired by Google more then 3(!) years ago and yet after all that time they STILL don't integrate with Android security / Google accounts or ANY third party logon in any way at all.  Frankly, I'm tried of typing my username (why can't the app remember my username??) and password every time I want to use the app...  While apps like eBay can login with a fingerprint on my phone, in 2017 Nest can't remember my username or a login over 3 hrs... It's a bad joke

Please make it so that I can adjust the temperature using a timer. If I am up late one night and turn the heat up then the heat stays on all night long until the next program. Most thermostats will allow you to temporarily override the schedule for a set amount of time EG 4 hours.   This seems like a very basic function that Nest should have

Not what I was expecting. Analysis is very basic and even my timer from the 90s that this replaced allowed us  to schedule in 15 minute segments (nest doesn't allow you to schedule a temperature change more often than every hour). Sometimes it's nice to just top up the heating before bed for 15-30mins but now we have to either do it manually or burn an hours worth of gas. Seems to defeat the point ... surely in this digital age I should be able to schedule to the minute rather than to the hour!

Electrician - Installation review This review is more aimed at the designers of the actual hardware. So listen in.... It's crap... the terminations for the cables in the heat link are atrocious. A link is needed between L + 2 If using 230v which means 2 cables in one of those tiny terminals situated and hidden deep behind a load of plastic. Wise up. You've had 3 different designs now and you have that rubbish. Try using the stuff you design. Also need knock outs for rear cable entry. Also need 2 channels in the heatlink for multible zones.

I've had the thermostat for a couple of years now and generally it's fine but there are some weird things I simply don't understand about it. For a start the app often suggests I update to version 5 but I can't as it tells me I'm up to date when I try. It also ignores me when I walk past it and it's in eco mode which is just daft. The most annoying thing though is when I set it to come on manually and two minutes later it turns itself off! Very irritating tbh and I wouldn't bother having another one if I move house.
compound: -0.8877, neg: 0.126, neu: 0.837, pos: 0.037,

Only one phone for auto away? Forces you to use more energy OR not use eco temp I think it's hard to get a regular schedule put in and you can only use 1 phone for auto away, so when my husband/children are home alone it gets cold. Expensive toy for limited function. You can add more phones to manually change it but only changes to economic based on 1.  Also, having used it longer I've realized nest is changing my temperatures to make me use MORE energy, not less.  The reason is of you'e out of the house it goes to eco setting, even if that will use more energy than the schedule.

Thermostat is great, nest cam is bull App has always worked great for my nest thermostat, had it for over a year in a half now. Got a nest outdoor cam a few months ago.  Cool that it's the same app to control both features. I signed up for the free 30 day trial of the paid service. It worked well &amp; was quick to respond, BUT the zoning &amp; sensitivity was too much for my personal set up (car headlights &amp; people's shadows). Now the trial is over, the camera is garbage.

Process for installing works pretty well, but here are a few loose ends. 1. There is no good explanation of how multiple phones and/or multiple iPads and PC are set up with the nest app. 2.

Until devs do not fix it,  I will not change my review. The issues described are on all phones we have. It takes forever to connect, you have to get out and back in couple of times to connect to the camera. We use it as a baby monitor. We set it on to monitor the baby,  then it leaves the camera and goes to main menu after some time.  No retry to connect whatsoever. So, for baby monitor -10 points. We never had problems with older drop cam app. It connects instantly, and reconnects if it needs to +10...  Update: I guess i am getting use to close the app and restart it. However the latest version introduced another bug. When you rotate the screen it puts the 15 sec back UI and the text popup that asks you to subscribe for nest services. Every time i grab my phone half of my camera view gets hidden because of those things. You have to tap on the screen to make it go away...very very very annoying.

1. It takes 60 Mb on disk just to show temperature circular bar and a couple of setting pages 2. Application launching takes forever. To adjust temperature takes time too. So it is quicker to go down stairs and set temperature manually than to wait the application to do that. 3. It always requires internet connection so if you have internet outage you have no remote service. Philips HUE application does not need internet when you use it at home and it works much faster. 4. Password is required to be secure so you have to enter digits, upper and lower case letters and at least one special symbol $#@!. Why do they require all that stuff. I do not manage my bank account with Nest and why do they what those 4 symbols to be entered? Why don't the use %^&amp;*()?  Overall this application is like condom: nobody likes - everybody uses because other options are even worse.

Still only uses gps and not a connected wifi ssid. I live in a concrete building, gps does not work well.  Let me select an ssid that is "home" instead of using gps.  It will be a million times more reliable and require less battery.  Or at least let me set the size of the geo fence myself to account for the margin of error in my location reporting.  Constantly sends me notifications of movements when I am home all day. The "simple"  "just works"  approach is useless when it doesn't work,  give advanced users more advanced controls.

New update sucks (now with less suck) Bring back the option to watch the feed full screen! Those of us who don't subscribe have no use for the timeline feature, but it takes up half the screen! Ridiculous..... Update: yes, if you have rotate on, then yes. But why not give the option for full screen portrait as before? And still don't care about the history view. Let us turn it off. Conclusion: still sucks.                                         Update, 11/28: sucks less. Full screen portrait is back. Looks like they heard the complaints.

Works okay but still issues My cameras will switch as if they are in away mode(turn on and off), however my nest thermostat will remain on.  It's basically not saving me any money unless I manually turn the thermostat to away manually. I've gone through every piece of trouble shooting available and even talked to their support team who was unable to solve the issue.  If that gets fixed I'll upgrade to 5 star. Currently using a Samsung GS7.  Fyi-using the app "coming home" has fixed the issue until nest finds a way to fix their app.

Cam is great, app location not so much I had great expectations from this cam. The cam is good, no qualms there. But the cam depends on phone location to smartly determine if there is anyone at home.

Fundamentally misunderstands convenience Stop trying to automate my devices. I want the ability to control my devices from my phone, not my devices to have minds of their own. The camera turns on and off regardless of what I tell it to do and the thermostat "learns" for a week but then set in its ways and does not adapt to new seasons. Just give me control and stop giving my devices wills of their own. I understand putting those features in, but removing or overiding the manual toggles makes them uncontrollable.

Recent Upgrade A Step Back The recent Upgrade that removed home / away temperatures for the thermostat and replaced them with an Eco setting has been a step in the wrong direction. Before my other apps (ex. Door lock) would let my thermostat know when I am away and it would set the temperature to away mode. Now setting my Nest to away has no impact on the temperature setting. I have to set my nest to away then manual set my temperatures to Eco mode.

It's ridiculous! Actually you can't set it to any specific time. It only sets from the hour or half past. WHY IS THAT?

Crashes every time I try and view the live feed or history. Working fine now it no longer crashes.   However the banner about subscription status is annoying. I have already paid for the year however it keeps showing me how many days are left on my free trial. it blocks a big portion of the camera frame and even when you hit X to close, it comes right back. Need to remove this. Thank goodness only 6 more days until my subscription kicks in.

Manually setting "Away" does not use Eco temperatures unless you also enable Home/Away assist? Nobody thought this through. Home/Away assist only works for ADHD households where someone is always dancing in front of the thermostats. Requires GPS to add another camera. Requires 3rd party cookies to subscribe to Nest Aware. Nonstop nagging that I'm subscribed to Nest Aware for a new camera. 15 second forward/back buttons sometimes time warp you hours or days. 16:9 preview of cameras only if all 7 of my Protects make a disorganized mess of things.

Disappointing... I was greatly disappointed in this app. I mainly use it for nest cam (use it to keep an eye on my home during the day) and it is a battery hog! I stream youtube videos all the time at 1080p and it still doesn't drain my battery as much as this app when the quality of the video stream is not at 1080p. Furthermore, it doesn't have a proper full screen mode the banner displaying the room name (which serves no useful benefit) keeps popping up covering the screen. I don't know how that is not a standard thing for any video/streaming app.  Given that Nest is also an Alphabet company same as Google/YouTube, I don't understand how this video streaming app is SOOO much worse than YouTube. Edit: It's further weird that these issues are not there in the iPhone app. You would think Nest would work better on Android, given it is a Google OS.

Unnecessary upgrades, missing basics Folks it is just a thermostat!   So quit putzing with the name of the feature. Renaminig away to eco does nothing to make you more 'green'. Taking away ability to set manually without the app is just dumb.   Leave it alone and stop messing with it.  If you really want to fix something give us a better range with the fan run times.  A hold temp is basic and missing- Monday holidays are always a fight with the programming without a hold.

Used to be a 4.5 star app First, let me say that I love my best camera and thermostat. They're not perfect, but good. What dropped the rating? The camera feature took a step back with the UI and introduced some now unfixed bugs. I loved being able to scroll through a list of short clips. Now they use a scrollable timberline. It's now harder to see the activities at a glance. The most annoying bug... when you select to go back or forward 15 seconds, it will sometimes jump to a day or two before.

Works with OpenTherm finally, but... For thermostat - 3rd gen works now with OpenTherm protocol what is great as now it can communicate with new boilers   smarter... You cannot set target medium (water) circulation temperature. Statistics is just basic - usage of heating, but not for hot water. No advanced OpenTherm data are available like circulation, flame, pressure, in/out temperature. Definitely needs improvements for OpenTherm.

Very frusterated with the new version! You can't pinpoint to view a specific event. The "scrolling" makes it very difficult to quickly view a past event.

Meh at best The app itself is kinda ok, but you have very little actual control of your camera.   You can't share the camera through the app, only through the website (which is not that user friendly either). The camera itself is pretty good quality. But you can't control it through the app. Specifically,  you can't turn it off. It comes on automatically without any rhyme or reason. Overall, it loses its awesomeness and becomes an annoyance really fast

Disappointed I'm very disappointed with the change Nest has made with the viewing of its camera's.

Terrible update/Returning Camera Update is AWFUL! Motion detection used to send a concise video clip of activity. Update replaced this with buggy "timeline". You must scroll/align the event perfectly w/ a TINY line. It's easy to shoot too far forward or behind and miss the event. App should allow clicking the preview for precise clip. Also, nag screen for Aware covers 1/4 of video. Glad the update came during trial and return period. Old version was so good, I wanted to upgrade to Aware. Now I don't even want the camera for live feed.

A couple of UI annoyance relating to screen orientation. A big event for me is when the heat link disconnects. If it fails to reconnect in a ten minute period - it means my toddlers room is potentially going to go drop in temperature. It usually requires I nip in, check the cables, and cross my fingers, but it is a big deal for me. If IFTTT supported that as an event, then I think I would be fine with that as a workaround. Protect is missing the path light etc settings?

Great but hard to review camera A few updates ago, it was so easy to review motion alerts. Now I scroll through all these dots it's hard to line up. Before I was able to review an entire day in a minutes because each motion started playing the video. Now I have guess where the dots start and watch the video for a minute or so on each one. I usually get about 45 motions a day and it's takes alot longer to review view.

Overall good app Doesn't crash. Works as intended. Just some annoying issues. The banner that pops up every 15 seconds saying I'm subscribed to nest aware is annoying. It takes you out of full screen. Hopefully that goes away. I wish you could make clips or at least share screenshots directly from the app.

Extortion. Totally useless if you don't pay and someone breaks in while sleeping for more than three hours. I bought the camera after being told about the subscription but was also told that if I didn't subscribe that I would still get a 24 hour recording. That is not close to the truth. It will only go back three hours and you get a stupid snap shot. If you plan on not paying 100 to 300 dollars a year extortion money to be able to actually use the camera I would not buy this product. Buy a game/trail camera instead. With that you at least get multiple pictures and sometimes video you can store on a memory card.

Whhhhyyyyyy????? Do you think the point of an update is to make the app worse?firstly, I don't care about the snap shots when it is a clip that the camera chose because it felt it necessary that I see a moment after movement. Secondly, The talk back function is so glitchy that I'm actually embarrassed for you.Thirdly, You took away the button to turn it off  but left the one on the main screen to turn it back on. Thanks! That's super helpful!  *insert exhaustingly sarcastic tone* I love going into settings to turn it off.

Horrible update! Not user friendly at all! If I hadn't dropped all this money on all these cameras I would be switching to a different product. The new update sucks horribly. The old version was much more user friendly and now the way the time line history feeds is confusing, you can click on a specific time to see what's going on, if you try it the video doesn't play half the time. It's really bad overall. I hope they will update this quickly because it's a deal breaker for me and I'm not recommending it to anyone.

Frustrating to use App for NestCam Scrolling to a specific event is nearly impossible. You basically have to watch the whole clip to see what the action was. Also that "nest aware subscription" pop ups over your video, even after you've subscribed!! Stop! I know I'm subscribed, I don't need a pop up reminder ever 10 seconds. Love the camera, hate the app. Camera does go offline at least once daily.

This app used to be serviceable, but a recent change makes it nearly impossible to see what is going on because you cannot maximize the camera view to the screen.  Instead, more than half the screen is reserved for "activity history" even when you have "activity history off" which renders it basically useless.

Recent update messed it up We use nest cam as a baby monitor. With the new update its difficult to say if your feed is live. Earlier a timestamp with the feed gave an idea of how much lag is there. Unless one has Nest Aware, Activity History is a pain taking up screen space and not doing much. There should me an option to have/not have the section. Switching to Night Vision and back doesn't happen automatically anymore. Although i have set the switching to auto it never switches on its own.

Great support Revised review.  I contacted Nest support and they have me a number of things to trouble shoot.   My husband had already figured out that the camera had to be restarted after restating all devices hadn't worked. The added feature to see still images of events if you are not subscribed to their service is kind of neat.   We use it as a baby monitor and love it so far.  The only feature I would like is for you to be able to set it to have no visual display unless noise is detected.

Cam Update Needs Work While I like the idea of being able to quickly scrub through cam feeds, it is very unreliable when you want to look at a specific event. Sometimes the video does not choose to play, it is very hard to check out the beginning of the event and it is hard to tell if you are live unless you actually hit the 'Go Live' button. If I had to choose, I'd much rather go back to how the app used to be. It was far more intuitive and it was super super easy to quickly watch all of the events while scrolling, unlike now

Good overall but a few annoyances Using it for two cameras; very cool timeline, but phone location detection for home/away isn't reliable - to fix that, why not add an option to detect my home WiFi? Also, I really wish I could choose the notification sound and turn vibration on/off, instead of being stuck with the default (which means I have to take my phone out and look at it just to tell whether the notification is from Nest vs. some other app).

Cam Home/Away assist is unreliable! App does what it's supposed to for turning camera on/off &amp; checking history, but Home / Away assist is completely useless. Usually I'll find that either it says I'm still at home and off when I'm in fact away, or it's switched to away, but the camera's shut off. Do yourself a favor, don't screw yourself over of the purpose of having a cam for security, by allowing this app do enable / disable it for you. Also contacted support and was given some weak excuse that this feature is more for the thermostat.

Update disaster Terrible update. The new sightline is fine but it is a much worse experience overall because that is the one way to interact with the camera. It was much better when history was an option and live was the default. The small window for viewing is a huge disappointment. Most of the app ui is now taken up by blank space in the sightline feature. This is a terrible change and limits the quality of viewing enormously. Also the loss of the on/off toggle on the main ui is inexplicable. Why would this be moved?

Hate updated version Please please please fix this updated version. My nest cam is my baby monitor and now i dont have a time clock and all i have is a tiny window to view my baby. I was in love with my nest cam before this update. Now i hate it! Im giving this a few days then i may have to go buy a different monitor. Im disappointed that they make most of the screen for the video subscribers. Its just away for them to try to force you into buying the subscription.

New Sightline feature botched The initial roll-out of Sightline is a clear step down. It's difficult (compared to the previous layout) to zoom in on the start of a clip. Clicking on the clip in sightline takes you into the middle of it, rather than the start (the way it used to). Being able to zoom forwards and backwards in time (sightline) sounds interesting, but is only useful if there is activity throughout the entire time line, but these cameras are (probably for everyone) recording mostly still life. So the only pieces most users care about are the clips of activity. That said, why make it more difficult to find those and to play the clip at the start (rather than the middle) of activity? Silly update

Great but there is one thing your app developers are missing that is KEY! Create an option to toggle home and away via saved "Home" WiFi SSID. When I'm in my basement 100% chnace of going auto-away. Add that and you get 5 stars!

They added in Sightline with no way to remove it??? I use this camera as my monitor in my infant's room. With this new update, the activity tracker takes up half of my screen. I need to see what's happening now, not the hours ago. I am going to the store to buy another monitor because it makes me uncomfortable to have half the viewing space taken away.

MAJOR Issues with Update The recent update SUCKS! The way the history is set up makes it impossible to pinpoint something without having to monkey around, but at that point you just give up. To turn my camera on or off I now have to go into a different screen, wasting more of my time. Put the on/off option back on the view screen and put the history back the way it was! Why can't developers understand their way isn't EVER the right or best way? Nest, you're idiots!

What happened? New update is terrible!! I loved the app before the update that I loaded today. It's hard to navigate, images are blurry and just isn't good at all!!! It stop and starts then the timer freezes. If I got this for security and I can't even see the images or detect the motion whats the point of this camera? Who thought this update would be an upgrade at Nest?? I wish  never updated it.   I can definitely see myself looking into getting a whole new security camera system.

New Update Sucks The snapshot time line being forced upon me is aggrevating. It forces me to keep the camera feed very small on my device since the time line takes up HALF the display. It makes monitoring my baby much more difficult at night. I don't subscribe to the service and have absolutely no use for the time line. I should be able to disable it. One more reason that I wish we would have bought a traditional baby video monitor instead of the nest. The complete uselessness when our internet is downis the other big one.

What the Hell did you people do?  This update broke everything! Don't you know how to test any kind of update in a sandbox first? This update broke everything and is a HORRIBLE UX. I could live with the ridiculous UX but anytime I try to view the history by tapping on the long timebar bubble, I'm told "your camera was off or offline at this time."  Really? It was 20 seconds ago and I can see everything perfectly under "Live" mode... and hello! You captured 5 minutes of activity while it was offline? I expected a lot more from a Google owned company!

Recent Update is Awful We have several of these cameras throughout our house. We liked them so much we've ended up using one as a baby monitor. Unfortunately, with the most recent update there is no longer a "history" shown for movement, but a 15-second back button, that doesn't work well. We are no longer able to look back using a mobile device, which is almost all we use. Super disappointed in this change.

Good, but some improvements desirable The Nest cam and app seem to work fairly well. The video feed sometimes lags by a few seconds, but this could be variation in the internet connection. Sometimes after changing settings, the app and camera take a minute or two to re-connect and recover the video and sound feed. Video quality is good and the ability to scroll through recent video history is nice. Greatest complaint: the annoying "Subscribe to Nest Aware" banner appears to be permanent, at least in this version of the app.

The unit measures room humidity and I would like this displayed at the same time as the temperature. As with many homes I have an issue with humidity and mould.

Notification frequency is disappointing I love this and would have given it 5 stars if there was a way to receive notifications more than once every 30 min. I understand they don't want to bombard us with notifications if the camera is picking up movement or sound, but I think that should be up to the consumer. I'd like to be able to have the option to receive alerts every 5 or 15 min.

A downgrade from Dropcam app Slow,  laggy and waste of money. Great cameras but they service is terrible. Website for viewing is a resource hog and takes forever to view.  I have Fios 75/75 mbps so it's not my system.  Get some competent techs on this.

Poor nest cam integration When viewing the nest cam in the app in landscape mode the overlay menu always reappears within ~20s, regardless of how often it is dismissed. This menu overlay on the video blocks roughly half of the viewable area of the camera.

Great thermostat,  app could use some work I really like the ability to adjust thermostat on the go.  The schedule portion of the app is very difficult to adjust. The sliders are very jerky and take a few minutes to adjust. Would be excellent if they had a way to enter a temp with a key pad or even a dial.

App needs improvement I can't get it to stay full screen for my nest cam. I keep seeing a stupid ad for your overpriced recording service and some other header. Even when I"hide" then they return and stay there. I just want to see the video full screen without another layer over it. It's like that on both my old htc and my brand new Samsung. I don't have the same issue on Apple products.
compound: 0.34, neg: 0.045, neu: 0.866, pos: 0.089, 

Love it! But there's always room for improvement. My biggest complaint is the fact that you cannot see the current temperature from the app. I can see humidity percentage, which is spiffy and all, but even my old $15 Honeywell thermostat would ALWAYS show the current temp. Yet again, things that my cheap thermostat could do that a $250 Nest cannot include running just the fan without turning on the thermostat. Otherwise the A/C kicks on. Farsight should also have the option of showing more than just one status. Otherwise, it's fantastic!

1080 Dropcam Pro? I like the app in general - it typically works well; however, with this update camera previews on the home screen sometimes black out for a few seconds and update slow/freeze.  The individual master view for each camera still works fine.  Did this update add 1080 support for the dropcam pros?  The email made it sound like it potentially was and I think the image looks a bit sharper but I'm not positive - ?

App gets worse with every update The false notifications get worse with every update. Home/away just doesn't work. Really poor software for such great hardware. Wish now I would have chosen another brand of camera. Keep thinking the next update will fix everything but it doesn't

Slight nag with location New location based auto away works great! However it constantly asks that WiFi be turned on, even though it works without it. I have GPS and WiFi location scans enabled and it works just fine, so I wish it wouldn't pester me every time I open the app to turn on WiFi.

Slow. Unstable. Unresponsive. This app is nothing but trash. Can't zoom in, can't go back on history without struggle, watch the video from the moment it registered the movement. Can't switch to landscape view, even if it do switch it's reloading the video. Why? Just why?

A little pricey for storage Everything is pretty awesome. Not much to complain about other than $10/mo. per camera! I have 2 cams and want more plus the outdoor cam, but not paying $50/mo. They should give the option to store the footage for less days for less money! That'd be awesome! I don't need 10 days worth of storage! If I need to download something, I'll do it the same day! Give us a 3 day storage option for $4 month! Thanks Nest!

Background Audio? So many service outages that it's comical.  The camera doesnt support local streaming so the camera was useless without the nest service up and running.I would love the option to listen to background audio while in other applications or with the screen off. This would make the dropcam a much more versatile baby monitor. That feature alone would sell more dropcams through word of mouth recommendations. The cell phone location detection seems to not work, thermostats never go auto away.

b"It's a pretty good app One thing I would like if would be possible is that I can add more time on my fan time. Every time need to wait till my existing time runs down,  or stop the fan and re started with the additional time I want to add. That should be a quick and easy fix hey ??"

Amazing device I've been seeing a lot of disappointed comments in here and I don't understand why. This was the easiest install of a thermostat ever. I've been running nest for about nine days so far and it appears to have created a schedule based on what I set it at. It makes small changes if I'm feeling extra hot. Nest is connected to my AT&amp;T Digital Life and responds to "away" mode when I arm my house. I would like to be able to see outside temperatures in the history. That would really help me understand my usage.

It is flawed.  In the APP I choose the option to send me notifications only when no one is home but it does not work.  The Nest Cam continues to send me notifications even when I am home.  I synced my phone to Nest to help with Auto Away but it still does not work.  Why does this thing keep sending me notifications even when I am home?  Its so annoying.  I don't need to know there is movement the Nest Cam sees when it is me in the house making the movement!

Thank u for the update Love the update and the ability to see all cameras better in one view, instead of the little circle previews! Keep it up. Would love to see a nest cam with either ptz or 180 angle. They are not cheap so would be great if less cameras could cover more space...also the time lag with the microphone feauture could be worked on.

Camera hardware and setup is excellent! The app, however, is often buggy. The most annoying feature is not being able to lock video image in full screen mode for longer than a few seconds. Otherwise, more than half of video image is obscured by app graphics and ads. Also, there's no way to disable video history if you don't want it. So, you have to wait a month for the free trial to expire even though you didn't ask for it.

Latest update is terrible / app no longer works (on my Android or wife's iPhone) Totally agree with everything already stated in recent comments here re: latest update. Forcing the timeline on us is BS, and is very clunky. Seems like you're taking up real estate purely to try and upsell NestAware, and the "live" clock timer disappeared, making it very difficult to tell whether looking at a happily sleeping baby, or a frozen still image... (I can't even get the camera view to come up via Chrome on my PC). It all worked fine before this update.  Now virtually worthless.

Does what you would expect for the most part. Live camera even on slow connections, full control over the thermostat.  I would like to set a custom sound for the notifications, however, so I am able to immediately tell that it's a camera that is trying to get my attention.

Problems with newest updates 8/4/16 The Nest &amp; Nest Protects used to work well but now nothing works. Auto away no longer works. Multiple false alarms in the middle of the night from the Protects (not app related? ). 8/11- still having to manually control away even when home late &amp; leaving at the same time every day. It won't switch to Home even when I'm in front of it. 8/29 - now the near is switching itself from cool to heat schedule. It's 85 degree in here! About to switch product lines.
