App:  Insteon for Hub 

Android app has nice layout but also has a bug, when programming the dual outlet into a scene, the bottom outlet refuses to respond to the off command, if programmed with an ios device,  the outlet responds correctly. Insteon support said they would call me back on this issue, its been 4 days and i am still waiting. The insteon line overall is a great and affordable way to automate your lighting system. It has been rock solid, easy to install and a great value for the money. Fix the android bug and it will get 5 stars from me.

The app works but has limitations.  On level is not configurable, no matter what the setting is the switch comes on to full level. Would be nice to be able to add custom icons. App freezes every once in a while. The interface is as basic as can be. It constantly runs in the background, draining the battery.

The app functions correctly but is slow to load and login, there are no widgets or hot keys, and interaction with nest thermostat is spotty. It needs a makeover badly. If I didn't already invest in insteon hardware I'd use others Update: many updates later and reliability of hub/app is not improved. You need a home controller to do anything serious. I can't believe I'm saying this considering my early adoption, but avoid Insteon.

Extremely outdated. Needs a major overhaul. Hard to use and not yet friendly. Scene schedules don't seem to be working yet they are all set up correctly and turn on/off if you do it manually. If I didn't already have money invested in this hardware I'd be getting something else that works better.

This app without a doubt sucks! I've had insteon products since 08 my entire home is outfitted with switches and lamplinks. 15 light switched are duds and the remaining lamp links are on their way out. This app constantly crashes. I've submitted complains to smarthome and they claim to have someone on the case. This was 3 months ago. I'm going to find another product to invest in that is more reliable that this garbage! You pay premium​ price for a sub par product. I'm done with you insteon!

The entire app needs to be overhauled with more android specific functionality.  The use of widgets would be a huge help as some of the other reviews mention.  Also, some tasks could easily be reduced to 1 step instead of 2.  God knows why they have a switch icon that doesn't give the ability to dim and brighten the light right away (only on and off).  This should be the first thing that is addressed.

I have been using this app for 3 years.  It has not changed and it is totally outdated now. It constantly has trouble connecting.

Device maintenance on my Samsung S7 says that this is a battery-wasting app and it seems that's the case. So don't leave this app in the background when not using it as it will drain your battery. Otherwise, it is what it is, it's very limited but seems to work for me. I also have SmartThings and apart from hardware-based Insteon linking (with the buttons on the switches) I do all automation within SmartThings. There's groovy code out there for the SmartThings IDE to integrate Insteon switches and dimmers which is all I use, mainly for the Keylinc keypads which no other manufacturer has.

Totally looses time if power goes off.  Should synchronize to the internet, it has ethernet! can't deal with daylight savings change,  app doesnt display hub time, so to reset the hub time you have to sign in with a computer.

I'm terribly disappointed in this app. I recognize the source code also. A lot of people are using it. It has very limited capabilities in my opinion. Ive seen free apps that do better if they would only get rid of those intrusive ads. The Camera portion is just completely useless. All you can do with it basically is look to see whats there. none of the other functions work well at all. And I just found out they are no longer supporting it and I just bought one last week. ERR

Just realized that all of my Motion Sensors and Open/Close sensors are no longer sending notifications or show a status even though the scenes are working fine. (lights turn on and off when walking by a MS) Swapped out batteries but no change. When I check the  Plug In Modules and I/O Link modules they all show correct status changes and can be controlled by the app. I removed and re-added my OC sensors and they started statusing and send push notifications again. Bummer - this means I have to spend a couple of hours reprogramming all my Motion Sensors and scenes. The hardware is great but the App has long been a thorn. Have several out buildings so need the power band and relay feature. Got 3 of these hubs at three sites but last year I stopped buying Insteon and have been purchasing

As soon as I leave and my phone switches over to LTE, the app pops up saying it lost its connection to my hub. Highly annoying.    As far as the rest of the app, it works and that's about it. App hasn't changed much since it's debut and it shows. UI is extremely outdated and several old bugs remain unfixed.

Insteon was a great idea.   I've invested over $1500 in equipping my house with Insteon devices and now I'm regretting it.  The android app is not keeping pace with eh iOS app.    I had to upgrade my hub to get access to my Logitech Harmony remotes.  I still can't access my Sonos devices even though this is a feature found on the iOS version for over a year.    Yes the app turns on my lights but that's about all I can use it for.

I am so fed up with this app. If I didn't have so much money invested I would never use insteon again. Horrendous interface. GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN. Been a user for 3 years and have not seen any huge improvements to functionality or usability. Wish they focused on Android as much as they do iOS.

I've had the Insteon system for 4 plus years in two separate homes and it has worked flawlessly from the start.  I suspect that most users with problems don't really know how to set up or use the system.  I have about 12 devices connected including cameras, all work well all the time.
compound: -0.3102, neg: 0.094, neu: 0.835, pos: 0.071, 

When the user brings up the app a second time, it has lost contact with the devices and cannot regain. The user must then press the back button a couple of times I'm so the system can log itself in again at which point it will properly determine the status of each device and allow the user to control them again. In contrast my alarm app and garage door controller app are always ready to go with the proper status whenever opened! So there's no reason insteon can't be as reliable. Otherwise their products themselves get four or five stars from me! Just not the stupid app.
compound: -0.1497, neg: 0.068, neu: 0.869, pos: 0.063, 

Still does not see keypads.  Even after updating app and hub.  Updating hub requires manually recording, deleting, and reinstalling every device.   Otherwise it's great.  But I wanted to program 4 button keypad to control a scene and you may not.
compound: 0.6249, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.898, pos: 0.102, 

This app does not allow you to customize or move the order of icons for Devices/Rooms/Scenes. They are placed automatically in Alphabetical order and that it. You have to live with it!! Also, one of the most annoying things is that for the 6 or 8 key dimmer switches, it doesn't come up as how it looks. It comes up as a basic switch, and then you have to click on the "+" every time, in order to expand it to view the whole keypad. Ridiculous! This should have been an option in the settings to choose default. By the way, if your hub doesn't have Internet, it is impossible to connect through your phone over Wifi to set anything up. The hub ALWAY needs to be able to reach the cloud, otherwise consider this whole system a paperweight.

Super basic UI, especially compared to the iOS version. Issue with connection being lost if the app idles in the background for longer than 10 minutes. The app will open and devices will sit there attempting to update their status forever. App must then be force quit and restarted. This was reported to Insteon in January 2017 and has not been address as of this writing in June 2017. The problem is reproduced on both my Android phones.

Possibly the worst app ever made. Unreliable and you have to back out of it any time your screen locks. By the time this app connects to the hub, you could have gotten up and turned on the light. Worthless. Let a third party make alternate apps for your system since you are inept.

I agree with so many others. What a crappy app. I started it (after plugging the hub into my router), was invited to set up an account, then to add a device I was prompted to enter a user name and password. Nowhere was it clear that I wasn't entering the username I had just set up. No, apparently there is a sticker on the hub that had it's own name and password. By the way, the app has a "scan QR code" option, that doesn't work. So I manually enter the name and password on the hub. Then the app tells me it's looking for firmware update (no choice), which it never finishes. Restarting it, I see choices of devices to add. I have one: a wired dimmer. Press and hold the setup button, then have the app look for devices... You guessed it, searches forever. Go through the "manual add" procedure. Can't find it. Terrible start.

By can't get into my accout with the app because it wants to find the hub.    Stuck and don't want to wait on customer service.  But looks like I will.

Just won the starter kit with two dimmers at a company raffle. Got home to set it up and the app crashed during the process. Now I can't log into the app because it can't see the hub. I never even got to finish pairing it with the hub. The support section I. The website does not mention what to do in this situation at all so now I'm stuck with a hub I can't connect to. At least I didnt pay for it I guess.

You can do better than this!! Android app is almost unusable.  Started out fine but as I added more Insteon devises it is now so unstable that nothing works.  Apple devises work fine but as an Android user I refuse to change phones just to have this all work.  Oh well spent a few hundred dollars on Insteon products that will all be going back to Amazon.  Seems Insteon doesn't need the additional revenue from Android users...must be nice!

Who designed this app? Please fire that person so they can go find a job they are actually good at!

Shame on you Insteon :-(

The app works ok. There is no way to reorder the icons so that most used devices can be set in a more convenient way. There is no way to view a camera and turn on a switch and see it work. One has to change from the camera to the switch and then back to the camera to see if the command was executed. A split screen view would solve this issue.

Absolutely the worst app I've ever installed.    For some reason, while on vacation and driving across country, and while the Google Map app was running on my phone's screen, and while this Insteon app was not even displayed on the screen, it managed to somehow use almost 6 GB of my 4G Verizon cellular data.  WHY? Why would this Insteon app use 6 GB of cellular data while not even being used?    I really really dislike Insteon now. It did it once more and used 2 GB more data before I caught it and killed the app in Android Setup.  It's a huge risk to even have this app loaded on my phone now.  What was it doing? What is it going?  I'm a little .. upset.  Going to switch to Honeywell.

It's been awhile since I've updated my review and a lot of updates to the app and hub firmware as well. The Android app now works consistently, and I've had nearly no problems in the last few months with adding, removing, renaming or creating scenes like in the past. I hope they add ifft support soon, and simplify the weird interface.  It has come a long ways from what it was.

Don't waste your money on Insteon Close to $1000 in equipment, and 100s of hours put into trying to get this system set up right and it still gives me headaches every day. The Insteon for Hub app itself has hardly changed since it's first debut despite numerous obvious shortcomings. At this point I am using Logitech's Harmony system to control my hub because they managed to create a better interface in a matter of months than Insteon has in several years..i swear, there can't be more than 2 people on their development team.

Considering the reviews and responses that there is a backend issue preventing new users from connecting since at least 2/6, that tells me Insteon isnt concerned about fixing their issues. Any other company would have fired every management person involved in not fixing this issue quickly. I too am plagued by the inability to login to my new hub. Insteon you need to fix the issue and not require new installations to call your support line.

ANDROID APP NEEDS SOME TWEAKING  I have a small fortune invested in numerous Insteon switches, outlets, cameras, hubs etc. I have two homes and Insteon works 99% of the time with no issues under my IOS or Windows platforms. The Android platform does not allow me to switch from one home to the other within the app the way my Apple app and Windows app does. Can your tech department fix this issue with an update or is there some sort of trick to make this work for Android. Get it working properly and I will come back and give you a 100% favorable rating

Bought this over two weeks ago returning it now. Won't connect to Hub . called the company 5 days ago sat on hold for an hour somebody picked up and then hung up sat on hold another hour and then was told they were updating the app and to try again and if it doesn't work to call back on Tuesday. Today is Wednesday have been on hold an hour and 5 minutes no one ever answered have install the app and put it back on. unplugged it, tried it on different phones and tablets nothing will connect to the hub.

Been doing lighting controls for over 12 years and electronics for 30. This system is frustrating and extremely time consuming if you have a windows based or Android ios, phone or pad, it is EXTREMELY unreliable. Sometimes it took the program, sometimes it didn't. As a professional, I will tell 2 big builders tomorrow that I will decline to install this. Also, 2 days in a row, I was on hold for over 1 hour and a half twice for support before I hung up. I emailed and got a responce 2 days later.  This is not a professional product.  Good luck

Smarthome fails at making basic modems that can last more than 2 years and not die, and trying these hubs, found that their software is so dysfunctional they are of absolutely no use.  The app just crashes when I attempt to add a basic dimmer device.  So frustrating!

All development efforts go to iOS. 2 years of waiting n still same olé laggy, buggy, outdated app. Still waiting for widgets, G Wear, G TV, IFFTT and now Google Home support. The latter should be a no brainer. Example: Wear was released a whole year b4 the Iwatch.

Very convoluted Devices, rooms, scenes. The differentiation between these "types" get very muddy very quickly. Mixture of insteon and legacy X10 devices are hard to manage. Scheduling separate devices or scenes to come on or go off at the exact same time is not possible. Three separate devices or scenes cannot all be scheduled to turn on at 5:30pm and off at 12am. They're separate scenes because I want to be able to turn them on manually separately. Why can't I set them to be scheduled to turn on/off at the same time?

Easy to set up and use. I don't know why there are so many negative reviews. I did some homework and found out which system is best for me. Insteon may be a good choice for Android users. It works directly with NEST equipment, (owned by Google) so if you are following the Google trend this may be a good way to go. I hooked up the hub to my WiFi router. Installed the app. Identified my modules, labeled my sites and had wireless control of lights, etc in less than an hour. If you can read and follow directions, it should go well.

Does what you need it to do As you can see by all the other ratings here, the app's not going to win any awards. But the Insteon network's ability to run lights and outlets on timers and manage them remotely from your phone gets the job done reliably, and that's good enough for me. If they make things easier to use, I certainly won't complain, but I'm definitely a very satisfied customer.

Poor app losts connection every 10 minutes It used to be OK. However, after I switched my phone to Google Pixel, which is Android Nougat, the app started to constantly drop connection. Everytime I'd like to use it I have to wait for 10 sec to let the app reconnect itself to the hub, in which time I would have turned on the switch by hand. So inconvenience! Insteon device is good but the app is definitely poor. And remember it almost compatible with NO other smart devices. I'm replacing my insteon with Smartthings or Wink Hub.

Dangerous App. This app opens sets of 3 UPnP ports on my wifi router. After a while another set is opened without closing the previous one. This continues until so many ports are opened that other UPnP applications such as IP cameras stop working. This is substandard from any data security point of view.

Needs some work. Has many missing features that are available in the older Windows version, HouseLinc. Frustrating that Insteon has abandoned the Windows platform as it was maturing nicely. Not everyone wants JUST a Smartphone interface. And if they did we must have those features. I have a couple dozen devices, yet only 9 show up on "All Devices" page! What??  Similar looking pages are confusing, hard to figure out which page you were on to do that "thing" you just did 10 minutes ago.

The latest version of the app makes it impossible to remove devices from scenes. It says the devices removed successfully, but they still respond to scene triggers.   I had this same problem since November 30, 2014 and it was fixed on July 11, 2016. In the August 22, 2016 version update it broke the fix and I am experiencing this issue again.  I have invested $1,300 into this system and I would suggest that anyone considering this product please consider a different smarthome system. Their developers simply do not put any attention into creating a consistent application experience. I could not dream of developing an application as sub-par as this.

Some glaring issues. Problem with the app finding devices after a few hours. Have to close app and reopen then the app will see the devices again. Otherwise it just keeps on searching and find nothing. Should have a timer function, device on for 15 minutes to something like 2 hours. Schedule is nice but a timer would be a good function to have.

Insteon does not love Android Can't believe how badly this app works on Android. I've heard the iOS app is solid, but the scene schedules do not work (especially when using sunset and sunrise) consistently when created or edited in the Android app. Not buying an iOS device, so I might have to return the Insteon devices and keep looking. Extremely disappointing.

Just updated to 1.9.1. The "one day off" problem is fixed, as well as the "Schedules apply to the whole week" problem is fixed also.  Being able to sleep in on weekends restored - Yay! The user interface still isn't a human-factors-sterling example, but it works. It would be nice if schedules could be set with event times being relative to other event times.  That way, when the time of my first class changes, I wouldn't have to edit every scene schedule in the morning ritual.  The concept of "scenes" rather than "events" has some undocumented surprises.  Have an scene that just turns off some controllers? You need to schedule the "off" time, not the "on" time.

Unfortunately "force remove" does not update the device, just the app.   This results in device still responding to scene commands.

Insteon is a great home automation platform - I have no complaints about the devices, the scheduling, and scenes. However, this app is so out of date, buggy, and all-around a pain to use. It is functional for me, but I don't enjoy opening the app. The appearance and flow from one item to the next needs work. Setting up scenes and connecting new devices needs work.   I love insteon, but I hate this app.

This app is great though (when it works) if you have a house full of Insteon devices.

Missing Many Features Fairly reliable...couple issues, but issues have been handled...good tech support.  One thing I would like to see is a widget, with the ability to turn off and on all alerts, or alerts for devices within a zone, with a single button push...as it is now, you have to login to the app, which takes 10-15 seconds or so, then disable or enable each alert for each device one by one.

I have too much invested in devices to give up but even with a 2nd gen hub it is still slow and buggy.  Sigh...

3rd party app surpasses tremendously. Before I've wasted money and purchased the hub, I used a 3rd party app called Foscam. Without the use of a hub I was capable of viewing my camera, listen in, and speak into the mic (on and off of network with crisp video). With this app I experience extreme lag in video and audio, and can not speak into a mic. App developers please step your game up. I expect more from a renowned company. VERY DISAPPOINTING!

It's ok when it works. But when I am not using it, randomly during the day, it will pop up "Insteon has stopped." In the middle of using navigation, for example. And this problem has been going on for a long time, even though I always keep the app up to date. Unacceptable. I would steer clear of the brand.

I have been using insteon for years with great success but unfortunately this app is horrible. The Hub is limited in what it can do but trying to use this on a tablet is just bad. The screen does not auto rotate so you can only look at it one direction and the overall user interface is clumsy and confusing. Insteon PLEASE get with Smart Things and deliver a hub/app that is really useful.   BTW - I Like Insteon and the way the hardware works way better than all the rest.

Incorrect day, time &amp; hardly works Tech support doesn't answer emails. It shows wrong date &amp; time. I can sometimes get it to work on wifi but never on data. This app is useless. I can only see the camera sometimes while on my wifi at home, which defeats the purpose of why I bought it.  Does anyone monitor these issues?  I keep emailing but no response.

Needs Work (C- at best) Inconsistent and incomplete.  Sometimes forgets my password, sometimes won't authenticate, sometimes won't connect to hub.  Sometimes I have to login - sometimes I don't.  I can work around by deleting cache, data, force close the app and start over - but that is real annoying.  iOS has multiple house support but Android does not.  All-in-All, not a professional grade app.  Could also use a functioning web interface for browsers.

Good physical product, poor application I've seen apps made in a day that work better with less bugs. It's 2015 and why can't you afford good programmers? If you can't come out with a usable product why are you even in the business then? Turning on and off lights should not require me to log in every time and dig through the app. Persistent login and widgets would make this wonderful. At present it's easier and less frustrating to physically walk to the light and turn it on/off, which to me means you failed at what you were trying to achieve.

This app does not leave up to the expectations of the product. Push notifications randomly stop working - app needs restarted, but you don't know it...

Getting better This app has major issues. Upgrading my original one star to two to 3 stars because Insteon seems to be making an effort.  UPDATE #1: Changing the time zone/location crashes the app using android 4.4.4 on the oneplus one. UPDATE #2: The scenes are working again, although there are still some scheduling bugs where devices turn ON at the incorrect day. UPDATE #3: the Timezone crashing seems to be fixed.  Upgrading to 3 stars. UPDATE #4 app is much more stable after several updates, upgrading to 4 stars! Good job insteon!

Half baked This app still isn't user friendly you have to go home all devices to load your cameras and at that they commonly won't load. I congratulate them for working on it but it needs help. There is no way to access it from the Web without the app. No way to set alarms or sirens, no way to record motion activated video, etc. Also sometimes it remembers my password to log in other times it doesn't. Sometimes it seems to log right in with no password in the field. Very odd.

Good not Great Currently I use the hub and light switches to control lights in/around my house. I have made purchases to add to the system with smoke detectors (with the smoke bridge), and plan on getting the water leak detector for my basement. Insteon lacks in a couple of areas: 1. The look/feel/ease of use of this app leaves a lot of room for improvement. I hope to see that soon. 2. Wish the system was open to others (e.g. Chamberlain MyQ for my garage door, my Trane thermostat, etc.).

Terrible app, equipment, and support! Everything about this product is terrible all the way from the product itself to the customer support offered by the company! Most apps traditionally update to fix issues whereas it seems that Insteon prefers to push out updates that remove features or cause the app to cease function entirely. I will definitely be switching too smart things as soon as I can! Thanks for nothing Insteon for your latest update on 8/7 that has now rendered this app and all of my equipment useless. It constantly crashes now!

Let me start off by saying the hardware by Insteon I find to be amazing and reliable.  I have the assurance kit, nothing crazy, and all the sensors and gizmos work as they should, would give those 5 stars.  Now on to the app, the Achilles heal of the bundle.  It is a confusing mess of menus and poor flow.  If I launch straight from icon, it will auto login like I want.  But I hate that if I hit the back arrow to try and get back to the main menu or even close the app, it brings me back to the login screen without a password prefilled and then if I hit it again it wants me to either add an account or enter my info.  At that point i either have to type in the password, or close it completely to relaunch which then makes it sync with the hub again.  If you already have an account, there is no reason why it should even go to that page.  The menus are terrible.  There is no button to go straight to your devices, you have to click the room first then all devices.  I have only 5 devices, i find this annoying.    The thermostat icon is always at the bottom, no matter if you have one or not.

Insteon needs new management that cares for their customers.  The hub is 1% smart, it works great but requires your brain to make things happen.  1% is just a simple scheduling timer.      The hub does what it supposed to do when we tell it, so it not a hardware issue, it needs better software with some commonsense (AI).    If your current team doesn't have the skills to add some AI functions, please do this: fix the app so it can work in landscape mode.  (so simple to do).  If you can display vertically so how hard can it be to make it horizontal.     Too bad I cannot give your SW a zero  rating even  your HW deserve a 10.  Your bad rating is doing way better than  a simple app that can only display "hello world".   Your app is free, so you are not making any money from it .

Barely Usable This app's interface is worse than X10 controller apps written 20-30 years ago.  Sometimes the devices respond... other times they don't.  This is an orphaned part of the home automation equation that looks like insteon's management does not understand and does not support.  The most recent update broke sundown schedules that were dead on until the update and now they are an hour off.  Go in to try to just verify the location and the app crashes.  App's free... but the expensive device it is supposed to work with is essentially useless due to lack of support.

If Rube Goldberg had designed apps....... Insteon must farm their application development out to people who aren't insteon users themselves. Granted, insteon systems are designed to work mainly with keypads and other physical controllers, but it sure would be nice if the apps would at least somewhat mimic the ease of pushing a single button, to enable a scene. The nonsensical, overly complicated apps that they've churned out for Windows and Android are inexcusable.

Not quick Turning off a light has never taken me longer than it has with this application. After waking my phone or tablet, the application has to be killed and restarted in order to reconnect to hub, else it continuously cycles back to the home screen whenever a device is selected. A simple on/off switch has turned into half a minute of touch screen mayhem.  I found it confusing that using the back button signs me out of the hub. I actually can't think of a time when I would ever want to sign out.  Editing information isn't intuitive. There is a context-sensitive edit button on the bottom that allows scene, device, and room editing, but getting into the right context is a bit confusing. I'd rather have a single menu that displays "edit devices", "edit room" and "edit scene" rather having to remember that I have to be in the Room menu and "Edit This" to change device properties.  It's just not quite doing it for me.

Craptastic! Been using iSmartenIt with a Pi and Insteon USB PLM which has been decent but lacking in scene support. Bought the Hub2 to give it a whirl with the Insteon app and I can now see how horrible this is! Scene support works but connecting to the Hub reliably is wretched. iSmartenIt easily outperforms and has most of the same functionality.  Okay, root of the problem and this should *REALLY* be addressed, cloud connection is a requirement. This causes performance lag and keeps you from being able to use it without an Internet connection.

There is no ability to send alerts when a device is triggered, as described in the feature list.  Also, I cannot create a sunrise/sunset schedule for individual devices.  I have to group them together as a scene and trigger the scene.  If one needs an app to control their devices, use Tasker and Direct Commands.

Not good I love insteon and for yrs i had a PowerLine usb control i used w qwhomeautomation.  This app is slow to refresh, very slow to login as it authenticates and connects....up to 30 seconds! Please speed this up! Or hub is going back.  Also i prefer a list view as i have 30 devices and large icons and multiple pages not helpful.  Also takes too long for device to refresh each lights status.  Sometimes  wrong light turns on w scheduler and sunset and sunrise don't work. To get nest working I had to use an ipad.

Disappointing I have been using the insteon app and hub for about 5 months now.  When I first got the kit, it was glitchy and slow.  After I wrote a bad review on here it did get a lot better.  Over the last two months or so it has gotten worst.  The app can't ever connect to the device even when right next to it.  Unplugging the hub then plugging back in worked for a while but even that is not resetting it.  Also, this technology doesn't let me turn lights on/off while away from the hub.  Big mistake, in buying.

Not ready for prime time Uninstalled this week after a few months of trying. It would appear that the core of the Insteon system is quite sophisticated but this does not translate well in the app (which is the sole method of control). Unless you are grounded in the more arcane procedures of linking devices and using one or another as a controller, this will not work for you. Unfortunately, you are left to your own devices (as it were) to "figure out" how things work. Functions that should be simple and intuitive to program, are not. After the second or third time you turn off a light switch and watch every controlled device go out, or arrive (or wake) to find that a programmed sequence simply does not execute, you will move on. Take a look at Insteon's updated product documentation to get a feel for the complexity of the system. Unfortunately, at this level, "you can't ge there from here".

Huge step down from Mobilinc Finicky setup of the insteon hub is the first frustrating part of this software, but luckily you'll forget about that once you actually try to use it.

Serious Flaws. Exactly the kind of app that a programmer should be sentenced to use for all of eternity for producing.  Desperately needs widgets.  I just want to press one button to turn a light on and off... But using this app I have to: Open the app, Find the right room, Press the light, And then turn it on and off using a virtual switch...  And why even have the virtual switch, the icon tells me if it's on or off already, just toggle the state when i click that, unless it's a dimmer and actually needs another level of interface.  Also, why do I have to add every switch to All devices, and then add it to rooms.  I have to give them longer names to keep them sorted this way.  Every single room has a light and a fan, so why not make a sorting system that understands the basic way that electric devices are arranged in a house?

With some UI tweeks this app will be exactly what I'm looking for: A toggle option for none dimable units rather than a popup panel. More rows in the app, a widgets for android so I can have scene buttons on the launcher. A Plugin for locale/Tasker would be great and allow for some conditional responses.

T Lin Simplicity is good. Few buttons do not work properly, like location, the popup does not do anything useful. My hub's time is off few hours, but cannot find a way to reset it. Please do something.  Schedule is not useful, can only set one timer. We have to create multiple scenes for the purpose. This is too tedious. Validation kick off too early when setting timer's time. Always has to retype user name and password after logout even remember is on.

Not a good start I am always amazed at how programmer's miss the obvious basic things. You ask for a phone number when creating a new account in your app. It might be wise to change that label to cell phone number since your sign up process says it's going to send a text to validate the sign up request and it only informs your new users after it to late that the phone needs to be a cell number. Man oh man... Keep the eye on the ball will ya. Very bad first impression

What hardware do I need? The app instructions say this is compatible with "INSTEON Hub." But there is no such thing on the market - only the Smartlinc Hub. But then the description says it's not compatible with that. So what do I need to use this app??
compound: -0.4098, neg: 0.059, neu: 0.941, pos: 0.0, 

Not ready, yet This app fell far short of it's implied capabilities.  The Hub seems to have the ability to do it's job, but the software cripples the hardware.  As a professional installer, the products I install have to work, and this is far from being plug an play.  Hopefully future updates will resolve the numerous faults in this product, and I will gladly repurchase the hardware.

Doesn't work. Useless. This works up to a point on my Nexus 4 phone, completely useless on Nexus 7, can't find the hub despite being on the same network as the phone. First experience of Insteon, not impressed,  app isn't intuitive or well designed and reliability of software and hardware are poor.  Update: now refuses to connect to any device. This is absolutely useless, will be uninstalling and contacting the hardware vendor for a refund.

Wow, easy setup! Okay they designed this product right for average consumers.  The setup was incredibly easy... that said I am having troubles connecting to the hub outside of my Wi-Fi... so I have to figure out why.  They need to make this part easier.  For example allow me to log into the cloud but provide me with possible solutions as to why I am having troubles connecting remotely.

I am looking forward to updates I've been using this with only lights for two weeks now. I love the idea, but the reality leaves a bit to be desired.   1) It would be helpful for there to be a place one can type in a dimmed percentage because the app doesn't respond quickly or accurately to touch.   2) I'm unable to access the Hub from 3/4G. The app only recognizes the Hub if I'm on my home wifi. This makes it rather frustrating because I primarily bought this system to be able to  turn on lights before I come home at night.   I know this is brand new and I'll try to be patient, but I am waiting to see what happens before I invest any more in this line.

Dear Insteon team: HIRE A UX DESIGNER! I am a ux designer and it took me way too long to set up your convoluted app with ambiguous terminology. I cringe at the thought of an average user trying to use this. It is hands down the worst, unusable app I have had the displeasure to lock myself into. Honest question, do you guys even try the software you ship?! Test this app with minimum 5 users and you will uncover the usability nightmare issues that plague this app. I have to KILL the app every time I launch it to get the modules to show their status and control them. Absolutely unacceptable in 2017. I repeat: HIRE A UX DESIGNER OR YOU WILL FAIL AS A PRODUCT. I will change my rating when you fix the status not showing on first run issue.

insteon for hub for android I already had quite a few insteon products in my house and was used to using HouseLinc to set things up.  Now I'm not tied to the computer to do setup, just walk around with my phone and tap to add them. Added an open close sensor to my garage door and back gate so I can get an email and a text message when they open or close.  I have UPnP turned on in my router and the hub installed quickly without any problems. It's slow to get to it when off my network but it does seem to finally connect.  Scenes aren't as powerful as HouseLinc and a couple took a few tries to get right. I agree with whoever mentioned timers needing some upgrading - HouseLinc is still going to be running most of my schedules at least until the next version comes out.  I got one of my 2 IP cameras to install right away, the second camera took a bit of work but that could have been a problem with my network or the distance of the camera from my router.  I like where you're going with this, looking forward to the next update.

Love it but needs to load and connect to hub much faster Biggest complaint I have is that when I run it, it takes forever to find the devices on my network and link to them so that i can control them. But it's a great product over all and I've tried everything from super expensive systems to inexpensive ones like X 10. And this one is by far the one with the most potential. Don't expect it to work well in apartment buildings

Bad app The most difficult,  time consuming,  and too many steps to go through in order to set up. After 3 days struggling to connect android to ethernet  (without hub), I'm still not connected.  There's also issues with entering my passwords. I set the password and user name, then go back to log in, and I get either error or cannot recognize my user name or password! Extremely difficult app. Not worth it. And to think back why I purchased this to begin with, which was the convincing explanation of Plug &amp; Play ease

Neither of which is true, nor is stability and range. If you hook this piece of junk up and it finds the guest part of the wifi you're screwed because you cannot get off the guest wifi and my android phone on the new s5 could not find or sinc up with this crap. I am almost an expert computer user and no one here could figure it out. We did get it to sinc up once for about 2 min then it quit again. Buyer beware. Total garbage.

Huge step down from Mobilinc Finicky setup of the insteon hub is the first frustrating part of this software, but luckily you'll forget about that once you actually try to use it. With the older mobilinc software and the 2412n controller I had widgets on my homescreen that allowed easy, one touch on/off operation. Now I have to open the app, find the device/scene, select it, then use the stupid virtual switch. No widgets also means all my NFC tags I used when leaving, going to bed, etc are useless now too.
