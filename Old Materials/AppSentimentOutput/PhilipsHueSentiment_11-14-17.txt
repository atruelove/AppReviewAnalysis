App:  Philips Hue 

App is useless. I downloaded it and worked for a little bit. Then it needed an update so I selected update and it froze. Tried several times to update, tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it opens, then goes to the update, then freezes and I have to close with an app killer. Why do I have to update when I'm downloading from the play store? Shouldn't the new app I'm downloading be the most current version? Phillips really needs to respond to these issues. In the meantime I'm looking into other lighting options that actually work.
compound: -0.7399, neg: 0.094, neu: 0.875, pos: 0.031, 

The new turn off functionality doesn't work at the routine. Not only that but because of it the lights wouldn't even turn on. The hue engineers need to test before releasing. The customer service rep told me to reset my bridge before this bug gets reported. So horrible that the customer has to suffer because hue engineers don't do their jobs. The cto has to do the job
compound: -0.8988, neg: 0.131, neu: 0.869, pos: 0.0, 

Connection is extremely inconsistent with bridge and myHue and my lights also take a long time to respond when turning on a scene. I cant control my lights outside my home because it never connects to the bridge. Ive had these lights for more than two years and i have seen zero improvements in regards to connectivity.
compound: 0.3182, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.958, pos: 0.042, 

The lights turn on or off at their own will sometimes. The home &amp; away just doesn't work like it should. I get back home and connect to wifi and it doesn't know I'm home. Sometimes I turn the lights off to go to sleep and they suddenly turn on. Can't be sure that they turn off when I leave. Philips needs to fix this app. They keep updating it with no noticeable improvements, only bugs. The lights just turned on again as I'm typing this....
compound: -0.4891, neg: 0.085, neu: 0.889, pos: 0.026, 

I love the lights, but the app is terrible. When it updates, it stops functioning until you install the update, and you have to be near the bridge. So my lights are left on all day if I don't notice it in time.  Also, I can't sign into My hue account. I just get a black screen everytime I try. Philips needs to put some work into their app. It sucks.
compound: -0.7717, neg: 0.128, neu: 0.837, pos: 0.036, 

Absolute junk. Lights turn on or off randomly, home/away routines don't work at ALL, using the app is frustrating because it randomly changes light settings when switching between home/away pages. Useless POS, I wish I'd gone with a different brand. A good old light switch is preferable at this point.
compound: -0.0258, neg: 0.105, neu: 0.792, pos: 0.103, 

The new version of this won't let me switch bridges until I update the current bridge... Which is impossible at my own house, since the bridge it was last connected to is at my boyfriend's house. My personal Hue lights are useless until this app gets fixed. Or at least until next time I drive out to my boyfriend's house.
compound: -0.4215, neg: 0.047, neu: 0.953, pos: 0.0, 

The app is not that bad, but is missing something very important. If I want to put the lights changing by it self I can't because I don't have that in the app. I would love to have the option you leave the light changing color it self, it would be very nice. Even changing the tone with the ritmo of the music would be cool. Please fix that small detail !

Developed by Autism.  Programming is done by retards.  Lights work and a week later won't cum on.  I swear my head of but to no avail, obvious Philips has hired a few retards and has definitely not fired them yet.  Those lights should not be so pricey is the app is Brain Dead....like the developer.

They just updated it and now my echo dot doesn't work with it.  An update that reduces functionality!  Awesome!  Try another brand that doesn't have the excessive price tag that Hue bulbs do if you plan on using these with an echo device.  Inexcusable!!

Routines don't work properly and are unpredictable. Not even confident they work when I'm at home, let alone when I'm away from the house. Lights turn on with a routine, but at times never turn off.. Not consistent at all. Have no confidence it will work when away. Needs more development.

A while ago you fixed the home &amp; away functionality of this app but then it quit working because it won't let my log into myHue.  It takes me to the browser and the option to log in with Google just return that's an error error, but will let me log in with my hue login and password, but when I close the browser, this app still says I need to log into myHue, and thus the home and away options don't function.  Will this ever be fixed again.
compound: -0.7964, neg: 0.078, neu: 0.922, pos: 0.0, 

Overall I think this app is working fine.  The only real thing that I can think of is at times the app can't detect the bridge when I am home.  Plus I will agree with other people in saying that the app icon shouldn't have been changed.  It looked just fine as a black icon.
compound: 0.6249, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.885, pos: 0.115, 

It works fine for me. Occasionally it will get confused, especially if the power has gone out or the bridge needs to be updated, but most of the time it works exactly like it is supposed to.  But the new app icon looks far too much like the eBay app icon. It's a bit annoying when I'm trying to find the app and I don't have my glasses on, like if I'm in bed.
compound: 0.714, neg: 0.063, neu: 0.801, pos: 0.135, 

Nice update. You lock out the functionality of choosing the bridge i want to connect to until i update, which for me means i cant use the app since im not near the last bridge i was connected to. Super smart, A+!
compound: 0.8748, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.756, pos: 0.244, 

The app feels like a last resort to control lights in realtime. Its not the best UI and is a slow process relative flicking a switch. So it feels like a config tool for the lights and in that regard it is pretty good.   My main compliant however is the app does not or cannot adapt to the current state of bulbs. For example, say you have lights dim  out every night at 10pm.  Rather than dimming down from the lights current state such as OFF, it will start on and dim to off. The lights were already off! Stupid.   Sees like a simple concept but  not there. Greatly reduces experience with these lights and I have every type of bulbs so doesn't seem hardware based.
compound: 0.4953, neg: 0.035, neu: 0.89, pos: 0.076, 

What the hell? The app worked fine until last night's update. Now it cannot find the existing bridge. My lights are useless until this gets fixed. Thanks a lot Philips!
compound: -0.6114, neg: 0.206, neu: 0.669, pos: 0.126, 

This app works, but has a terrible user experience which needs more attention on. It's too easy to turn the house lights off by mistake or another person's room. The app does not follow platform UI/UX guidelines thus confusing for inexperienced users
compound: -0.6956, neg: 0.19, neu: 0.733, pos: 0.076, 

All I get is a screen saying I NEED to update the app but no buttons to use.   App store says it's up to date.  When it was working it would have been nice to have an easy sleep button.

Did this even go through QA? There are so many problems with this update that I can't even list them all. Why can't I set more than four lights per room, or more than more than four rooms per routine? Why is creating/selecting a scene now exceedingly difficult? Why isn't there a vertical widget yet? WHY CAN'T I LOGIN, the app says the bridge is offline when its clearly connected! Updates are supposed to make things better, not worse. Next time, focus on functionality before you worry about aesthetics.
compound: -0.4545, neg: 0.116, neu: 0.8, pos: 0.085, 

This update is horrible! Update deleted all of my scenes and presets. There is no way to get to scenes. We spend a lot of time getting our home to look just right with your product and then you just delete our hard work. The pictures of your app still shows the scenes page. Get it together Phillips. We spend a lot of money on your products. This app has never been up to par from the beginning. Hue Pro is the way to go...a much better app.

One of the worst connected hime apps. This and the wemo app are right there at the bottom of the barrel. This app is almost unusable. 99% of the time I open it to switch a light on or off it needs to update. This update is NOT optional. The app will not function until you update. This requires getting up to press the hubs button. Every. Single. Time. Why do I even have connected devices if I need to get up out of bed and press a button every time i want to turn the lights off. That sounds a lot like like a standard hard wired switch to me except with more glitches and less reliability. Rating: F.

Works well, great with Alexa, but interface could be made smaller,  ie I've now got 9 rooms hued up but the main screen will only show 6 and I have to scroll to see the other 3, it would be much better if they were all visible on the one screen.

Finally starting to get better, but not good yet.  I'll update if and when they fix all these issues that should have been working since day 1:  - Add full house "room" that controls all lights so we can create themes for the whole house.  - Add ability to control color and brightness of multiple lights or rooms at once by long pressing lights.

Not quite sure why this app has such low ratings. It always has worked for me on multiple devices. All aspects of the app function exactly as they should, no problems. Now I would like to see more features and functions added such as color changing patterns but not worth giving a bad review.
compound: -0.3854, neg: 0.184, neu: 0.725, pos: 0.091, 

I love Phillips hue but the app takes a very long time to connect sometimes. It ends up being quicker to talk to Google assistant to turn on the lights. Also. It'd be nice if when the app finally connects what ever setting I had last on the app would sync with the bulbs. Alot of the time it'll show turned on in the app but the bulbs remain off.
compound: 0.743, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.912, pos: 0.088, 

The app is stable and set up went very easily for me. The app UI is simple, once you figure it out. I admit I didn't pay attention to the tutorial. Maybe have a way to restart the tutorial or a link to help in about section. The ability to reorganize and delete scenes on long press is really nice. The timers are fun but too cumbersome to access and set up to be really useful for short duration. I am going to look at Alexa and IFTTT for a faster timer experience. The location features are great when they work. I'm not entirely sure who's fault it is when they don't.
compound: 0.9172, neg: 0.054, neu: 0.756, pos: 0.19, 

Very very useful. Not much flaws, however, it would be 5 stars if there was a notification telling you if the electricity went out. Everytime there's an event where the house loses power, you won't know that the lights have been on for the whole day because there's no notification for this. Please look into a possible "notification" fix. Thanks!

Love the lights, Hate this app :( the last hue app was user friendly, neat, easy to group lights and create the perfect colour. I find this app chunky and ugly. Its hard to use, to find things quickly and create new scenes.

The app works well, and has great features. It does keep popping up saying 'Out of home' connection quite regularly whilst I'm at home if I use my WiFi extender. The Hue hub is direct wired to my Sky Hub and signal strength is pretty good throughout the house so I don't know why. Love the home and away routines; it's great to come home to light so I'm not blind when I go indoors lol. Great work, Philips. Next please add G9 smart bulbs and I'll be happy. Also, just a thought, add a way to make one light fitting/location include multiple bulbs so they can sync the same way. Some light fittings have more than one bulb.
compound: 0.9865, neg: 0.024, neu: 0.711, pos: 0.265, 

Where the hell did light recipes go?? Or the ability to add your own and to customize which lights turn which color? This hamfisted approach flies in the face of why I started using Hue lights in the first place. Very glad the old app is still available; this one is complete garbage.

Incompatible with duel band routers. If your router has 5ghtz band, you'll only be able to use the app in Out of Home mode, which is a considerable handicap as you can't use many of the apps features in out off home. Customer support told me that they do not not intend to correct this shortcoming.

We lost features, setting up routines is annoying, navigation is convoluted, and the app minimizes to a browser too log in. Then it doesn't remember I logged in later.

The motion sensor has a major flaw please fix in update. You cannot have different auto off settings during the day and night modes.

To Philips credit, this app has improved greatly over time. It has a clean interface, has an excellent widget implementation, and is reasonably well featured. It would be great to see rooms replaced (or augmented) with groups, with lights being allowed in more than one group. It would be nice to trigger routines from a widget button, not just a time of day. It would be nice to have a "fade off" option, like in the win 10 app "hue dynamic". And it would be nice to expose the advanced tap and dimmer programming seen in other apps. But so far so good, it's the only hue app on my phone. I use "hue dynamic" to program my dimmers and taps.

Lack of imagination. When you think about it everything is a routine so there's really no need for 3 separate sections (Got to sleep, Wake up and Routines).  Oddly Routines will not wake my lights up so rendering them redundant.  Another thing that's frustrating is that only routines allow you to assign a scene.

The inability to do a slow fade (eg 5 seconds from full to off) is breathtaking by its absence. If I want an abrupt change I'll just use an old fashioned (and inexpensive) switch. With a "cutting edge" lighting controller, this is a staggering omission. Please can you look into this?

Why does this update my lights so often? And why do updates take sooooo long!?! It makes no sense to me. Every time I go to use this app to adjust some lights, it forces me to do an update that takes well over 5 mins...  Anyway, I really expected a much better design / interface than what appears here. Perhaps one of their hundreds of updates will one day solve this problem.

compound: 0.8687, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.748, pos: 0.252, 

My biggest problem is with the widget. It has great customization when it comes to making buttons, but it looks really bad. The buttons differentiate themselves enough on their own from the wallpaper, but it's all placed on a background that isn't transparent and has a bar over the top. Imagine if every app on your home screen was in box with a darker bar over it with the name. It would look very over complicated. The only thing you should see is the button and the name. There are also other possibilities for expansion like a dimmer slider or color wheel, but those too should be implemented without any graphical salad behind it.
compound: -0.0102, neg: 0.059, neu: 0.875, pos: 0.067, 

This app works perfect for me. The newest update improves Routines to allow turning lights off in same routine as turning them on rather than having to create a separate routine to turn lights off. I don't get the low rating for this app. I have never had a problem with the Hue lights app and it is very versatile. Works great over cellular when away from home.

It's a basic system to control Hue lights, however it lacks depth and tends to be bulky. This is especially true when dealing with more complex logic (multiple sets of rules/devices), working with Hue Labs (not native to app) and certain hardware (like pre-existing dimmer switches).    While it lacks in certain areas, the app is essential in connecting and starting to use your Hue system.

Has loads of problems. It forgets light setting and refused to save geofencing options. I'd set them and save them, when I returned to the screen, the settings were as though I never put them in. Geofencing is broken and has never worked, which was a selling feature for the lights. It feels like a bait and switch. App interface is slow and clunky. Version one was far superior.

I read the description of the gen 1 app when it turned grey and it said everyone anticipating second gen app but its significantly lacking in features and functionality.

Seriously limits what the hue bulbs should be able to do.  It was possible before to create scenes that controlled all the lights.  Now you are limited to do this on a room by room basis only.  Meaning the dimmers are extremely limited and it's impossible to set moods for a whole apartment with one click.  Simply a terrible app.  Since they've stopped supporting scenes from the v1 app, this has crippled hue bulbs in home automation. As live in a loft, this app makes me want to return everything.

I wish I had tried the app before purchasing. I had a LIFX bulb as a test and decided to get a pack of Hues for bulk purposes. The LIFX app is much better, much more flexible with time events (wake up, dim), much more intuitive to use, etc. It's also disappointing how the lights reset to bright white after being switched off. Really disappointed and wish I had stuck with LIFX.

The user interface is great, but the functionality is lacking.  Compared to third party apps like "Hue Pro", this app is sub par.  This is surprising as the hardware is all yours.  I've been looking at the network traffic trying to figure out what it's going wrong.  I've adjusted router settings, but nothing has helped like switching apps.  The problem is typically the connection to the hub.  Often I have to toggle on/off up to 30 times before the light finally responds.  Color changes often stop responding after the first change.  Third part apps don't have this issue.  It's a shame as their user interfaces aren't as nice.

lousy, you cannot make light belong to more then one room. and when you do, you lose all the presets you had since the lights are removed from other rooms and the presets simply void. The app was ordered by philips from q contractor to give a basic app, problem is that its quite bad. also slow and does not recognize the bridge, so you need to close it, open again, and it works, sometimes more then twice is needed. you'll be disappointed , but most of the others are even less functional and very cumbersome and slow.

I don't ask for TOO MUCH out of managing my bulbs right now but location-aware automation is one of the features I was sold on and from what I now understand, Philips has neglected to fix the issue on Android for at least the better part of a YEAR despite numerous complaints.  And I can tell you as an iPad user location-aware works just fine on iOS.  That is, quite simply, tremendously disrespectful to Android customers and very unprofessional.  I do love the concept of this product, it's a great idea, but the way Philips had handled this issue, which is to say, basically ignoring well-paying customers who can't use their broken products the way it was advertised, leaves a bad taste in my mouth with this company.  I've seen no sort of explanation or apology from Philips about this.  Just a disgusting display of apathy given a glaringly broken significant feature that has remained that way for months and months months.  If someone can think of a legitimate excuse for that please let me know.  EDIT:  Downgraded to one star.  No excuse for them to take THIS long to fix the Geofencing.  You don't take YEARS to fix a bug if you really cared.  As a customer I'm disgusted.  EDIT 2:  The broken Geofencing fix was long overdue (and that's an understatement) but it is here and after spending some time with it I finally feel like I have the product I paid good money for and updated my rating accordingly.

This app took only the name of its predecessor. The actual usability is awful. The original version of this app was far easier to use, manage, and understand. (My review of that app is a Shakespearean soliloquy.) This one will be in modern English and hopefully easy for Philip's (if they even read these) to understand. In short, THIS APP IS TERRIBLE!!! I don't give a lot of negative reviews not do I type in all caps much, but this app however, required a more direct approach. Philip's took a wonderfully functional, not without flaws but functional, and gave us this. The new app is convoluted, with many flaws. To list a small few :  - Control of individual lights is much more difficult. I don't always want every light in a room on.   - The entire concept of the "scenes" is poorly executed and not useful.   - Setup and modification of add-on switches and controls is beyond bad. store I'll stop there because I have better things to do with my day than audit a horrible app. It's really telling when the gen 1 version of the app has a 3.6 rating in the store currently, while the "upgrade" is at 2.9. Really, consider moving the team who created this to another part of your businesses and bring back the original team to update the old app. While there are far superior pay apps out there, I shouldn't have to buy an app just to get a usable product.

Great hardware concept, TERRIBLE application.  Basic functionality on iOS devices is bad enough, but move to android and it's the application quality is that of a mobile application intern of 6 months. I've had this system for over 2 years now. On iOS it works ok, widgets work only when the app has been opened, and android is FAR worse. The widgets and big and bulky, often offer no description. For the longest time gsolocation for detecting when your home didn't work.  This was SAID to be fixed in the recent update.

I paid so much money for the hardware and philips can not develop a software that works on a simple android 5 tablet (samsung)?! The hell... That is embarrassing. It took too long to get a version for android 5 and now I can not use widgets because I can't change the widget name? Why?! I am glad that I have an iPhone too control my hue environment. Fix that and I will give you 5 stars!  Another update but no fixes... great! Now the widget icons won't shown. What the... -1 Star  Wow, another update.

Missed opportunities here. This is one of the very few apps that CAN be capable of doing so much more, but it just doesn't deliver outside the basics. Come on guys! Clearly the devs are not getting the push or resources to provide us with a better app. Think about smart lights 10 years from now. What do you want it to do? Make it happen now and use it in your company's marketing. Show the world why they need smart light bulbs and why you are the best.

Some of this app is good but only in the most basic way. You can't even rename the widgets, it will always revert the title back to "Widget." Also hard to control the color when sliding your finger near the other buttons changes the screen and they're hard to avoid for the whole top half of the spectrum. It's also incredibly stupid that only one account can be connected to the bridge so there can't be family or other house members with control outside of the home. This app is barely tolerable and mostly dumb

For people having problems with the widget, try turning off power saving mode to see of it works. I was constsntly getting "not connected to hue bridge" after recently changing my Galaxy S7 to use the medium power saving profile. For those who can't change there name of the widget, try selecting your scene first and then setting the name and click save. It works perfectly for me.

Great hardware concept, TERRIBLE application.  Basic functionality on iOS devices is bad enough, but move to android and it's the application quality is that of a mobile application intern of 6 months. I've had this system for over 2 years now. On iOS it works ok, widgets work only when the app has been opened, and android is FAR worse. The widgets and big and bulky, often offer no description. For the longest time gsolocation for detecting when your home didn't work.  This was SAID to be fixed in the recent update. It stays on now but often loses track of it's location, and turns the lights on and off at random. Absolutely useless.

While this is the sponsored app by Phillips for the hue light bulbs, there are lot of wrinkles to iron out. The actual app itself, inside the app that is, is quite good. The interface is easy to use and intuitive. The widgets and everything else however, are not. I get that there are many other apps in the App Store that apparently are more functional than this one for the light bulbs, but a 29 bucks a pop I would really help with the sponsored app is the best one you could buy for the product. Please continue to work on these issues to make it better. Especially the widgets. I should be able to click it and then I should go off, simple as that. Right now I click it, and the lights take about 10 to 15 seconds before they recognize that I hit the button, and then they go out. Not intuitive at all.
compound: 0.9667, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.875, pos: 0.125, 

The widgets are unreliable, the alarms are unreliable, and there's no way to just turn on a scene for the whole house rather than selecting the scene for each room individually (other than the unreliable widgets outside of the app).

compound: 0.1027, neg: 0.107, neu: 0.796, pos: 0.097, 

At first, the layout of the app took a little "figuring out." After a few minutes, it made sense and turned out to be fairly easy to use.    Best part: you can let Amazon Alexa discover your Hue system (individual lights, rooms, and scenes you've configured) and then voice-control your lights.

It would be nice to create a scene or something that will set the lights for a room back to a chosen default color. I find that after using another app to do disco lights or something. I have to open this one and set the lights back to my default color. As the lights remember whatever color/s they were set to when they were turned off via standard light switch. This app shows those same color settings as default when you turn the lights back on again later. Would be nice to have an option to say "living room" is always "this" color when activated from this button in the app. That also gives one button correction after usng a Hue Labs feature as well. Would save a bit of  time. Otherwise it works fine.

For all the potential of the Hue system of lighting, this APP is terribly designed. The main screen for example lists your rooms but cannot be sorted into an order that would make sense for the user. The room descriptions themselves are such fat lines that you can only see 4 rooms without having to scroll around. (and I have just 10 room zones designated). The GPS feature simply does not work. I have not yet been able to get my 2015 Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (Verizon, Android 6.0.1) to turn on the driveway lights as I approach the house. (I do have a good 4GLTE signal.)

Buggy. Non intuitive. Limited. Ugly? Location aware disappears and doesn't work. Prompted for update and it seems nothing happened. Not always a save to set config sometimes a back is enough.

It's not intuitive. All lights need adding to a room before you can control them. Then to individually control them you need to open up the room. Also the timer is rubbish. I do t want to set up a routine, I don't go to bed at the exact same time each night. I just want to be able to tell the lights to turn off after 30 minutes (or such time). I see the old app with these benefits is still available. That tells a lot about the confidence in this app. It does look pretty though.

Whoever thought it was a good idea to have the UI randomly jump around while I'm trying to hit a freaking 4mm light switch is a complete nitwit. I don't care about the connection state, because it's absurd that the app only connects when I open it. That's the worst possible time to START connecting because that's when I want to use my lights. Was the user story "as a user, I always want to wait 10 seconds before I can use my Hue lights"?  To say nothing of the countless bugs and poor UX patterns!

The app seems fine for setting up the lights to start off with. It fails to be able to control the lights most of the time, which isnt that big of an issue because I use google home and Alexa. A very large problem is the fact that I can't set up more then 1 house. As far as I can tell, everything is set as 1 house per account, which makes it very annoying to use the assistants. Saying, turn on all the lights will turn them all on. In both of my houses.

It would be really great if you moved the connecting status bar below the list of lights, or in such a way that it doesn't interrupt the UI. Every time I go to turn the lights on or off, the connecting status bar disappears and shunts the list up and you miss the toggle to turn the lights on or off, which results in you being taken somewhere else. Urgh. Happens every time, and so frustrating. Come on Philips. These are premium products with an average app experience. Sharpen your game.

Most of it works great. Adding devices is simple.  Works great with Alexa.  I replaced 21 bulbs with the Philips hue bulbs. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because Philips has yet to resolve the location feature and its been over 5 months since I purchased the Philips hue system and Philips has been aware of this problem. Still I love the system.

Hey Philips! You are still advertising that your products have features that you have not had working for years. YEARS! (EG GPS based features) isn't that at least a bit rude? It seems like you've basically given up on it, I mean, it worked years ago, then stopped working and you keep saying: "we are trying to fix it!" But on all packaging and advertising and the hue website advertise it as a working feature. Why don't you just think of all the features that hue might one day have and advertise all of them?! I mean, you're already engaging in false advertising. The quality of your new app is so bad and even the most obvious features took years to think of.. (eg: the option to turn your lights on before updating, so that you aren't stuck in darkness at random times, should have been accounted for when designing the app, at the very first meeting) and it is still not as reliable as the old app. The hue hardware is pretty good though, too bad about the app. I personally don't use the official app very often, as I have everything running flawlessly through third party apps like huepro and Tasker..  but every time it updates I give it a shot for a few days and it is just so bad, so bad when it could be so good. Why are these 3rd party apps made by a couple people so reliable and awesome!? Why can one guy program a third party app to do geofencing, but a multi billion dollar Company cannot?  But yeah just keep pumping out that hue hardware.. you've sold hundreds of millions of dollars of hue systems and I'm guessing you've put about 8 bucks into the development of the app. I no longer buy hue products to add to my system, nor do I recommend them to anyone.

I've tried all the other apps for hue, and keep coming back to this one.  I've never had any problems that other people complain about.  I like the app, like my hue bulbs, and look forward to the soon coming day when I have all my bulbs switched over.  Edit. App us still working great.  Not a hitch.  I honestly don't understand all of the low ratings.  All works fine.  Someone gave a low rating because you couldn't put a bulb in two rooms?  So control more than I room with your switch or routine.  Someone else didn't like the color choice on wake?  Umm, then create your own wake routine and your own scene and use your own colors.  I tried hue pro that someone liked.  This is SO much more straightforward.  Oh, and still haven't had a glitch or crash in the app over several months.  My biggest complaint, if there is one, is that it has cost me a very pretty penny to change the whole house over to hue, but it was worth it.  I periodically try new apps with my bulbs and some do things that this doesn't.  Most are missing functionality and most are less stable than this is.  I use another app for animations when I want a party atmosphere but for 99% of what I do with my hue bulbs, this is my go-to, and I'm very happy with it.  Maybe people just like to gripe?

Philips have produced a terrible app that is a backward step on the previous iteration. It has sullied my thoughts on what I felt was an extremely good product initially (Philips hue), and needs to be sorted ASAP. The geolocation feature on the app just flat-out doesn't work, it won't let me cancel an alarm set for 0600 in the morning (very annoying), and keeps logging me out of my hue.

At least once a week it fails to either turn on or turn off the lights and it's not because of a weak wi-fi signal because I live in a small house and I can use the WiFi  connection even when I'm on the street.

Really unclear why this has such low stars, the app is easy use, it is easy to add lights, group lights, control lights, etc. If I were going to wish for anything it would be for out of network control of lights - I do use SmartThings which allows me to remotely control but the Hue app is better when I specifically want to control my lights. I am a techie with 30+ bulbs and a ton of home automation systems and I think this app works great and deserves more than a 2.8 rating (as of 4/7/17).
compound: 0.9261, neg: 0.032, neu: 0.803, pos: 0.166, 

Can now set all scenes ad settings with voice control thanks to Philips Hue and Amazon Alexa. Was slightly confused with the addition of all new scenes found but there's a reason. Try it you will seriously love it.
compound: 0.7612, neg: 0.078, neu: 0.723, pos: 0.199, 

I really like the product, but I wish the app had more features (strobe, custom color loop, etc). The product is already expensive so I don't want to have to pay more money on third party apps for functionality that should come with the product.
compound: 0.7681, neg: 0.068, neu: 0.75, pos: 0.182, 

Update: bumping my rating from 1 to 3 stars. No more log in issues, widgets are responding much faster, and love that we can now still control the lights even when there is a firmware update and we no longer have to update first leaving us sitting in the dark. The reason I'm not going over 3 stars is because you STILL do not have the location feature fixed. I downloaded this app in November and it was broken then as well. That is too long to not have found a fix, especially since others are saying it worked just fine in your original, 1st Gen app.
compound: 0.4404, neg: 0.067, neu: 0.84, pos: 0.093, 

Inexplicably the feature to automatically turn your lights on when you get home and off when you leave still doesn't work. I consider this the single most useful feature a smart lighting system could have, and it hasn't worked (despite being present in the app) since I got the lights a couple of years ago. Pathetic.
compound: 0.3086, neg: 0.083, neu: 0.813, pos: 0.104, 

App seems a little on the flaky side, keeps bombing out unexpectedly. Lights themselves seem to work fine although it would be nice to have colour slider options too. Ability to show scenes separately from the mood settings and make custom mood palettes.

Home and away features never work.  It's incredibly slow.  Light response with this app is usually 10 - 20 seconds, and it doesn't always respond.

If they ever fix the location home/away feature, it might be worth while. These guys are only interested in having you buy their ridiculously expensive light bulbs, app is pathetic. They advertised here about the energy savings from the bulbs, imagine how true that would be if they actually turned off when you left the house. The main reason I purchased these things was for that feature. What a waste.
compound: -0.1027, neg: 0.112, neu: 0.768, pos: 0.12, 

The My Hue feature NEVER works. It is in a permanent offline state, even though it says I'm logged in. The 1st generation app is miles better from a feature functionality standpoint. MAKE THIS APP WORK CORRECTLY!  8 weeks later, and not even a reply from Phillips. Great customer service!
compound: 0.7955, neg: 0.029, neu: 0.826, pos: 0.146, 

Still some way to go, but significantly improved in functionality over the last months. Lights management on  a per room basis works well, but multi room is still somewhat limited.

Easy to use, works well with Alexa. Love being able to turn on /off lights when away.    Simple way to have dimmable lights for every bulb instantly creating the perfect ambiance for any mood or lighting need. Favorite bulbs are the BR 30 White  Ambiance smart bulbs...this app not only  allows those bulbs to be as dim or bright as needed but also as warm (yellow)or cool (blue) as needed without all the extra colors and at a reasonable price. Love it!
compound: 0.9727, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.72, pos: 0.28, 

I updated my rating to 4 stars because I find I use this app the most over other Hue apps. It's fast and simple and deserves recognition for that. Given that there are many different apps, all of which seem to specialize in different areas with no one single app providing EVERYTHING that you would want, this fits into the tool set usefully.  The Philips Hue app controls adding lights, naming them, assigning them to groups with relative ease. It handles updates to firmware and addition of accessories like the motion detector and dimmer switches more easily than other apps. It does *not* do color management or preset management well. If you are listening, Philips, I would love to have better preset management and ways to set up triggers and animations, using your accessories. The motion detector desperately needs a way to set end time. Better integration with IFTTT too.  There are apps on iOS which do creative things like animations that no Android app seems to handle well. But overall, this is a fine basic app. I use it for simple things, quickly, and it is fine.
compound: 0.975, neg: 0.034, neu: 0.795, pos: 0.171, 

Was a little confusing at first. The hiarchy of lights to room was not intuative. But once it's set up everything is good and working just fine. Looking forward to adding more devices.

Controlling the lights through the app - great, but only whilst at home. The location settings has, i think, only ever worked once and the home and away now doesn't work (again). Please sort it out. We pay A LOT for each bulb, only to be let down by the support.

I gave up on Hue a couple of years ago. On a lark, I re-installed and I am pleasantly surprised. But...the system and the app are far from great, they are simply adequate.  I also consider myself a casual user, I haven't even bothered with trying to set up location aware features (and it sounds like I shouldn't bother).  One minor gripe I have, the dimming sliders should not run from screen edge to screen edge, but just shy of both instead. Having any kind of case on the phone interferes with that edge. Likely a few pixel buffer would suffice without giving up to much screen real estate.  I'll update this rating if/when I go through and add more hue (or compatible) lights.
compound: 0.4726, neg: 0.042, neu: 0.857, pos: 0.101, 

While it controls my lights well at home, the "Location Aware" feature doesn't work at all. It would be nice to have my lights come on when I come home and turn off when I leave. It's stunning this feature has never worked for me on any Android device.

Hue is a closed system that only supports Phillips products. Home &amp; Away does not stay logged in. It prompts for it every time I tap Home &amp; Away. There's no Fade for widgets. Can't edit widgets. Can't fade up from zero anywhere. Scenes don't have an OFF (only goes down to 2%). This is rediculous. Login still a problem. None of the login options work. Still no candle mode.

The location function does not work properly. I have been wooken dozens of times because the light turned on at night until I turned it off, and the light flickers during the day... I have used Hues location function with 2 different android phones, and it didn't work with both.  Overall a disappointing product. Would not recommend.

Works well so far. Will be expensive to get the whole house automated but it's worth it. Only one problem, the home and away not working but not really an issue for me at the moment. Oh, get the Hue Pro app, it's only £2 and you can control away from home! It's a lot better than the standard app. Go for the white bulbs only...half the price and the colour is a novelty you quickly tire of.

Some how they manage to create a new app and make it worse than the first bad app.  Constantly disconnecting and logging out. Response time is slow and causing me to toggle lights back on and off and having to wait for up to 10 seconds before I see something. Why can't you create scenes across rooms? I want to control individual lights per room and scenes across rooms. Better control of individual lights but too many steps required to get to them.

You have to enter your Google password which is just plain weird, it should be linked to android account picker so the app doesn't need the password. Geofencing still doesn't work, you turn on location aware yet it never stays on.

Should be able to add each bulb to more than one room. So can set a house scene as well as per room scenes. Major oversight.  Also needs a numbered RGB slider to fine tune colours...maybe in advanced settings. Works very well with the amazon echo and will be getting some more of the bulbs and strips as and when my current bulbs blow.  Edit: tried the wake-up this morning. Not very good, standard warm white.   Should be able to set my own colour transitions. I thought I'd be able to create my own sunrise and sunset but it's only the default colour.

I love the lights but the software leaves much to be desired .. 1: Sometimes the app doesn't connect to the Hue bridge  2: Why no brightness control from the widget? Why must I go into the app just to adjust the brightness?! Just add a brightness slider to the widget damn you! 3: Why no function to have the lights slowely fade cycle through a changeable list of colours, like other Philips hue lights?  These are all easy things to do Philips, sort it!

The home &amp; away geofencing feature that has been advertised by Phillips is completely broken,, and has  a been since I purchased the product  3 months ago.

First purchase of the Hue and it's a lovely product. The Hue app itself seems fine but it appears you can't combine the same bulbs for more than one room configuration which is a pity. Still I love the Hue. Combining with other Android apps for Hue adds nice variety to just using the Hue app alone. Works with my Samsung Galaxy S6. Philips seems to advertise more of the Apple / iOS connection and not much about Android which for me was a bummer as it took lots of time to research to find out if it would in fact work with my Galaxy S6 and Android generally. Philips should try and make the connectivity to Android more clear.  A big chunk of us in the market are not Apple friends and prefer Android. On the whole love Hue!

Very basic app. Would expect more from Hue. What is really needed, which was on the old app, is a timer offset so that you can set timers with a random offset of up to 30 minutes either side of the time. This feature meant you could set up some good security lighting when away from home. Now, all you can do is set exact times, which is not handy for security.

Just gave up on the wemo system and came over to Hue. Wish I'd done it sooner. This system is much more reliable, easier to set up, and the colour effects are pretty cool. Could it be tweaked? Sure.

Much needed ui fixes but it doesn't work, constantly disconnected from hub, requires new login to myhue every time app starts, location aware does not save or work.  In addition, motion sensors need two time states, one for day time and one for night time.

It's a decent app. Most everything works. My only complaint are the widgets. They don't work correctly. The widget state always shows the light as off even though it's on. So you have to always press it twice to turn off a light.

I enjoy using the app. It is a little flaky.  For example, it doesn't handle being closed and reopened well.  Otherwise, it looks great and works well.  There is one major problem that others have noted. Each light can only exist in one group. I have groups called "kitchen", "living room", and "stairs".  I'd like to have another group called "downstairs" that controls them all and another group to control just the lights at the bottom of the stairs. Can't do it.

The old app was solid and all features work as expected. This new one is just packed with bugs. Turn lights ​on or off based on location? This app can't even keep the settings enabled.

I.e as my home is covered by more than 1 router, the bridge thinks I have left home and turns my lights off and on even though I am at home.

I want to control individual lights per room and scenes across rooms. Better control of individual lights but too many steps required to get to them.

The app works in general but there is a bug in fade in function. i.e. If wake up time is set to 7:30 and fade in time to 30 minutes then "if light was off" it will turn on properly at 7:00. That's good! But when on a particular day I woke up at 6:30 and I turned the light on already with remote control then guess what happens?? At 7:00 when the program starts it will first turn OFF the light and will start to fade in for those 30 minutes. That's not how it should work. If light is fully on then it's on and program should not interfere with it.

There is still a lot of work to be done. Where do I submit feature requests?  It needs the ability to register an "off" scene.  For example, I have a ceiling and corner lamp in my living room.   Using the dimmer is both on or both off, even if I set them up as separate rooms.   Most times I want only the corner lamp (which has 2 bulbs).    If I could set an off scene in dimmer press 1 to 3, then dim at 4 and bright at 5 for only the ceiling light, that would do.  It's not possible to use one dimmer to control 2 lights separately, or should I say, independently.  That's pretty primative.

This is the first time I have ever left a review for a product.  But, I felt so strongly that I was compelled to write, as I hope if enough people complain Philips will take notice.  The app is useless.  I have to use a third party app (Hue Pro) to control my lights.  It is bad when an outsider does a better job at interacting with your product then your own app does.   I recently purchased a motion sensor to accompany to my lights.  However, I have to go through the official app to add it to my system, as I didn't see a way to do it in the 3rd-party app.  I am stuck in a never ending loop of "An Update Is Available for your Hue Bridge".  After watching it, rather unsuccessfully, look like it was partially installing the update, I get the message that an error occurred and to try again.  And not just once, but DOZENS of times. Just when it appears that all is not lost (and the app tells me that the update is successful), I click DONE and and it informs me that an update is available.  Hmmmm.  Weird, I just installed a freaking update like five times!!! Today!  And of course, there is no way to bypass this screen so that I can interact with my system. Conclusion: unless you love being frustrated, staring at the same screen over and over and have tons of time to waste, then you should find another app (like Hue Pro) to use for your bulbs.  Just know that adding accessories to your system is also going to be a pain.  If the app doesn't get better, I will never buy another bulb or accessory from Philips.   Isn't the point to make life easier?  Not make it infuriating.

Nice but not always reliable The app has a very nice interface and gives you plenty of options for controlling your lights including colour pallets, brightness control and and variety of scenes. It can also handle routines that sometimes work, including the option to turn your lights on when you come home. Additionally you can ask it to only turn your lights on after sunset, however I have never got this to work. Overall a good app that handles the basics very well, but struggles with automation.
compound: 0.9141, neg: 0.037, neu: 0.796, pos: 0.167, 

Horrible app.  I'm an Android/iOS developer and this feels like it was written by a 10 year old.  I bought this brand home kit because it seemed to be integrated with Alexa the best.  Alexa can turn on a room but the 'scenes' take up one 'device' each.  I had to rename the lights themselves to turn them on and off, but apparently the app can't even rename your lights.  Had to go to the web interface.  The color changing functionality?  Award at best.  And Scenes?  I thought that would mean the ability to adjust my house, no.  It means that the lights in one room are the color of some picture you set.
compound: 0.9344, neg: 0.04, neu: 0.814, pos: 0.145, 

Good It's probably 3.5, its actually really good, nice scenes for rooms and simple to use. The main thing I dislike is the one bulb per room thing. Apart from that you get firmware updates and your settings are stored on the hub so anyone installing/visiting can easily get up and going. Worth getting just for that, worth trying before moving onto other apps.
compound: 0.895, neg: 0.035, neu: 0.757, pos: 0.208, 

Needs some work I like how they improved the look but as others have mention the flexibility has been lost compared to the first one. I didn't really notice the difficulty until I started adding the motion sensors. 1 light can only belong to one setup. That might have been ok until the motion sensor allows me to only choose the light setups and not individual lights without compromising other light setups. I.e I have 3 lights in a room for tv watching in 1 setup, my nightlight function I only want 1 to come on can't do it
compound: 0.4028, neg: 0.065, neu: 0.823, pos: 0.112, 

Constant updates I have never had an app that updates as often as this one. Plus when it decides to update, you cannot delay and operate your lights. You have to wait until it installs the update. Nothing is so critical as to force you to update while you lose control of your lights. I would not buy a hue system again. There are better options on the market.

Location awareness doesn't work The main selling feature doesn't work across apple or Android products. No one is able to get the light bulbs to turn off or on when leaving home or arriving. Waste of money. Don't buy this till Philips fixes the issue

The new app looks amazing but the scenes are buried way down in menus and if you add a scene,  you have to add it for EVERY ROOM. No global scenes. One thing that is really important and missing is a sunset option in the routines. Sunset changes a little every day so I'm having to edit my sunset routine almost every week. Please add an "At Sunset Option"!

Updates are heading in the right direction. Pointlessly mandatory updates are no more!:) that made a huge difference. And response time(be it from updates or resets). Has improved. The only thing is that i use to be able to have lights assigned to two "rooms". that made it convienent to change the dynamic lighting in the room i used most of my lights in. Now if i wanted to do that. Id have to put mutiple lights next to eachother. But assign them to different rooms. Why cant you just make the lights follow the order of the most recent rooms changes?

Still the worst app ever Buy another brand if it's not too late to return your bridge. Again today, I can't control my lights with this app because it has a pending firmware update. Previous firmware updates took away the ability to control my non-Philips bulbs and blacked out half of my house, so I really don't want to play that game any more. I paid for the Hue Pro app from the Play Store a bit ago. It's full featured and works as it should, there's just no firmware updates to add support for the new Philips hardware.
compound: -0.4019, neg: 0.097, neu: 0.833, pos: 0.071, 

After spending a bundle on bulbs and hub, it's ridiculous how poorly Phillips has executed on this.  Cannot start a routine with a button, but must mess with the clock?  Go to sleep routine gets much brighter before getting darker?  I could go on.  Just abysmally poor.  Has anyone at Phillips actually tried to use this app in real life?
compound: -0.7423, neg: 0.149, neu: 0.799, pos: 0.052, 

For an OEM app it's awful. The location aware doesn't stay on in the app. Most Changes made in the don't stay saved where some other things saved during the setup are impossible to change like the name of the bulb. Just got it last night and still have a few days to return it.
compound: -0.6327, neg: 0.127, neu: 0.831, pos: 0.042, 

The app looks and works well enough, but the organization of scenes and the way the work with switches is confusing. There seems to be no way of editing bulbs in a scene once it's been created. Generally speaking it's clumsy and hard to get around, very confusing. And it would be nice to have a color randomizer.  Edit: the more I use the app the more I realize it's absolute trash. It will not stay connected to the bridge while third party apps on this and other devices work just fine.

I am invested in the Philips hue system and an established app developer. I have often thought of creating a hue app but then see that this app is close with just minor adjustments required. For example, I can set up a routine but not to select a colour at a given time? Why? This would take 5 minutes to code in based on what you have and would add tremendous benefits.Just my thoughts.

Philips hue dimmer switch and motion sensor, not enough granular control.  When I manually activate the lights with the dimmer switch, or with the app, the motion sensor will override the dimmer switch/app and shut off the lights when it sees motion(after its preset interval).   Can the dimmer be set to override the motion sensor in the on position? This would make the system much better and stop me from having to manually disable the motion sensor every time I want to work in the garage or go in the back yard in the Hot tub.  ifttt style triggers for the dimmer switch would be great " IF dimmer switch ON pressed -THEN motion sensor disable. IF dimmer off pressed then motion sensor ENABLE  I understand not making the app too complicated, but add an advanced  user section.  The app is painfully buggy, and often has to be force quit to function again. After the recent light update, every one of my dimmer switches stopped functioning... had to manually re-pair every one of them :(  I have Philips hue all over my house and love them. It is just the small controls that are not present that make it frustrating and stop me from adding them to more parts of my house.

Good hardware, terrible app Having the lights turn on and off based on location flat out doesn't work and this has been a known issue since at least July 2016 and still hasn't been fixed.  The "scenes" interface is also incredibly stupid. Instead of just picking a color temperature, you have to pick a picture and try to zoom in on the color you want. It's an overly complicated mess that restricts your control. For the $130 you have to spend on a starter kit and then $30 for each extra bulb, this is unacceptable.

Pretty Basic and works quite well For this app to be the official release, it's pretty poor presentation all around. It does not provide all the features available, such as colour cycle.

Extremely buggy application Only the core functionality of directly controlling each light works. Once you try to use smart features, you'll see the app is buggy. The location awareness toggle keeps turning itself off. This has been broken for over half a year now so it seems like the company doesn't care. If you need to log in to your account, you'll have to log in about 5 to 10 times. The go to sleep routine will brighten your lights to over 50% if your lights are already dimmed!

Misleading sales tactics aka lies No where on the packaging of the lightstrip i bought does it say  anything about needing to buy more devices to control this light. This is extremely poor customer service and actually illegal. It says on the package its smart phone controllable, its color changing and dimmable. No where on the package or even in the package are any instructions on how to change the color or dim the light. No where does it say you'll have to go buy a hue hub to connect your phone to it. This is some illegal bs.

Take it out the back and put a bullet in it This is the worst piece of software I have ever tried to use, and coming from someone who has used iTunes, that's really saying something. The UI is one of the most unintuitive things ever, individual lights can't be listed in multiple "rooms" which means you can't group rooms and the geofencing is as buggy as anything I have ever seen. The Gen 1 app was pretty bad but this takes it to a whole new level of crappiness. It's a shame because the Hue hardware is awesome - it's just really let down by software.

Works great for me I'm not attempting to downplay anyones bad experience with the app, especially with so many negative reviews it's hard to deny there are people with issues. I don't have any issues with the app or bulbs. Setting scenes is simple, setting up new lamps or bulbs is simple. I have a total of 8 bulbs, one light strip, and one bloom.

Hate it I got a motion sensor. Using the ambient light sensor on the device. When the light sensor turns off the motion sensor, the light stays ON when the ambient light is satisfied. MAJOR FLAW, the lights stay on if the sensor goes inactive. If the sensor goes inactive while lights are on, it should send an off signal to the lights it is controlling.  Our lights were on all day even when the light sensor turned the device off and left all our lights ON.

Philips hue dimmer switch and motion sensor, not enough granular control.  When I manually activate the lights with the dimmer switch, or with the app, the motion sensor will override the dimmer switch/app and shut off the lights when it sees motion(after its preset interval).   Can the dimmer be set to override the motion sensor in the on position? This would make the system much better and stop me from having to manually disable the motion sensor every time I want to work in the garage or go in the back yard in the Hot tub.  ifttt style triggers for the dimmer switch would be great " IF dimmer switch ON pressed -THEN motion sensor disable. IF dimmer off pressed then motion sensor ENABLE  I understand not making the app too complicated, but add an advanced  user section.  The app is painfully buggy, and often has to be force quit to function again. After the recent light update, every one of my dimmer switches stopped functioning... had to manually re-pair every one of them :(  I have Philips hue all over my house and love them. It is just the small controls that are not present that make it frustrating and stop me from adding them to more parts of my house.

Incredibly inconsistent I've had to reinstall the app, change the ZigBee channel several times and even remove and readd the lights to the account (the lights took 3+ tries to readd each despite using the serial numbers) and I still don't get a consistent response from the app. I've had the starter pack for about 3 days and I am ready to throw the entire thing in the trash.

Major widget issues. I've installed the gen 2 app and it's a step...forward from the first app. The problem lies with the widget: it won't populate more than 8 scenes even if its size has been adapted to fit the 14 scenes I've created. And if you hope to fix the issue by rebooting your device, be aware that the widget won't even appear anymore after restart. Another problem comes with that "frozen widget" issue : the scenes are activated upon touching the corresponding icon but the "off" option doesn't appear anymore. Finally, unlike the first generation app, if you decide to remove the widget from your screen, the scenes you selected disappear from the widget settings page, which you can't even access from the app by the way !

Disappointing The app controls your Hue lights, but it's all rather minimalistic. There's no way to set a light to cycle through various colours. The Wake-up and Go-to-sleep functions are redundant: they don't let you control the colour of the light, but set up a My Routine and you can do the same with the colour of your choice. Geofencing doesn't work as the app disconnects from the bridge as soon as it goes to the background. Scenes you set up for 1 room cannot be used for another light or room. All a bit disappointing

Total Pants Great. This utterley pants app is now available to my tablets. Philips continue their possibly unbeatable track record of non investment in their product apps. Not going to waste your time or mine on this review. It's an utterly crap app which is rarely (every 6 months?) updated by undoubtedly clever people who have never been near a Hue light bulb.Very disappointed that I trusted Philips. Again. My own fault. Don't make it yours too.

Like It, HOWEVER Just bought today and already taking back.  I like the product, however you can only have one account linked to the Hub.  Now maybe I am missing something but that is kinda dumb.  When you have more than one person living in a house at least one more person should be able to control the lights when primary is not available kinda like NEST does.  Nice product but still needs some work to justify cost.

Works great. I'm on Android 7.0 Nexus 6p. Installation was easy and flawless.  Honestly, I was a bit worried after reading all the reviews. Im controlling my white ambiance kit with an Amazon echo dot. Last week I wasn't able to voice switch scenes - could only turn on/off and dim. There was a firmware update today that somehow fixed everything. It works as it should. I can voice switch scenes now. I can also simply say Turn off lights, instead of the full Turn off bedroom lights. Westworld here I come. Thanks hue!

It's good for security when you're away, as the 'Routines' scheduling function seems to work fine.

This has been a known issue for months and Philips don't seem in a hurry to fix it.  Overall, it has the potential to be a really useful piece of home automation but is still very much a work in progress.

Buggy Ran into multiple bugs. Brightness intensity sliders are terribly glitchy. Sliding them does not change intensity to the desired amount, not really sure how else to put it. Trying to dim lights to 50% will dim to seemingly random percentages. Widget buttons are sometimes shrunk to unclickable sizes and requires a phone reboot to fix the issue.

I can not get it to change colors or scenes by Voice commands . I tried IFTTT w/Alexa it's still not recognizing the command. Which is kinda why we bought it. Also if you want it to change colors to music or movies you need to download different apps for that, they where not free.

Very disappointing. First generation app was better but not working anymore for me. It is completely ridiculous that you can't create a scene with various lights from different rooms. Only lights associated with the room can be used in a scene. So when you have lights in your kitchen, dining room, and open living room instead of creating one scene you have to make three and launch each one separately. Also once a light is associated with a room, it can't be used for a different one.

It's getting better! The lights are now more responsive with the app. ● Being able to select the color of light in the "wake/sleep" setting would be nice, im sure theres a way bit i cant find it easily.  ● The Home / Away switch is very disguised and should be a clearly visible color coded toggle switch. ● It would be nice to have a widget that shows what lights are turning on/off while in away mode as well as an in app section that data logs light time usage both in, home and away modes. ● Navigating the settings really needs to be simplified, i shouldent have to jump through multiple sections just to make one change.

Go back to the first gen This app is so confusing and convoluted. They've essentially moved away from picture based light recipes and focused more on simple color graphs and that's really disappointing.

"New app" barely functions, but the old one works fine, wtf The new app was not my favorite from the get go. I haven't been able to get it to save any routines/alarms. It won't turn on the actual location feature, every time I turn it on and change screens, it's magically off again. It keeps making me log in to my account every time I try to get into the scheduling area and apparently refuses to save my login info. Now it won't even connect to my bridge.

The app offers basically no chance to create custom scenes. The only way to edit one of the default scenes is to zoom in on a colour area, hit shuffle, and hope that the result will look nice. No way to import scenes from the previous version of the app. No way to manage groups of lights in the same room. And the list of missing features and regressions can go on. This app is a huge step backwards compared to the previous version. It's basically a tiny demo that shows some things the Philips Hue can do - playing with four default non-editable scenes, and hoping that somebody who invested a lot of money in Philips Hue lightbulbs, LED strips and friends will be happy with that. Luckily there's a lot of unofficial apps out there doing a better job, but I have no clue of how a serious company like Philips could tolerate such a shamefully low quality for their official app.

Good but could be great Works well but could be better. why can't you choose a colour from an rgb pallet or hex code? Biggest suggestion is that the fade routine overwrites your current setting. So if you are dimmed watching a film then the fade out routine starts it goes to full brightness! Why not fade from the current percentage? Location aware immediately turns itself off after enabling, even with permissions set. Considering the cost of expect it to be a lot better, Samsung are going to be better at this rate.

The stock app Unfortunately this app isn't nearly as feature packed as others out there. Not allowing you to put a bulb into multiple groups, geofencing doesn't work, just overall lack in features. I seriously just use this to keep the firmware on my bulbs and bridge up to date, opening it from time to time. Look at the other apps out there for actually utilizing your setup.
compound: -0.6597, neg: 0.092, neu: 0.908, pos: 0.0, 

Won't retain blue or green user-selected colors The app is OK.  It gives you the ability to select the colour of light to shine using a screen with all the colors it supports.  However, it isn't saving any selected color in the lower half (green / blue) of the screen, unless it's very close to the light middle (almost white).  Try picking a deep blue, and it reverts your selection to a deep purple.  It does this with all 5 of my Gen 2 A19 bulbs.

To be honest and brief this app needs some work! I honestly am upgrading from a similar light that was bluetooth only and thought the same or similar would come from this app, not true.   At current there is no capability by the free version of this app that I am aware that will allow for the lights to make a transition. While there are moods on the app your light will be set at the previously established setting and color, for any changes it will have to be manually done. To be clear if you were looking to use sunset and your selection, after you select it your light will show that one color and the power of the bulb setting you make.   A more defined app would allow for your light to transition through all the colors in a continues pattern.  While I am giving a lower rating the interface with the Amazon Echo has been great! My lower rating is only based on the lack of functionality of this app.
compound: 0.9267, neg: 0.06, neu: 0.807, pos: 0.133, 

What? Let me start by saying that I have 27 lights &amp; had them for a few years. This new app is not at all like the old. First, the room set up. Not a bad idea but you can't add lights to more than one room. You should fix this. You can turn them all on but one room at a time. 2nd, it doesn't bring over any old scenes from the previous version. I have dozens of scenes &amp; no desire to start over. I will say that the interface is much easier to use. Please fix it!

Missing basic functionality The app is ok,  looks quite good but is not intuitive and is missing some basic functionality.  I have no idea how a company like Phillips can release the app with such obvious usability issues.  For example,  try setting fade out from now is impossible.  Seeing which routines are running is impossible.  And the worst when two routines start running simultaneously you get some weird effects. Great lights,  horrible app.

Please allow multiple rooms for single bulb I would like to have a room called "upstairs" with a predefined scene, and smaller areas like "dining table" and "TV corner" that are subsets of this room. Basically I need to be able to assign a single bulb to multiple rooms. This is not possible and it seems to be an arbitrary software limitation.

Not a bad idea but you can't add lights to more than one room. You should fix this. You can turn them all on but one room at a time. 2nd, it doesn't bring over any old scenes from the previous version. I have dozens of scenes &amp; no desire to start over.

Very basic, nukes battery Super bare bones features, and destroys the battery if you're on a wifi network and it can't find the hub. So...  Any time you're not at home.  Also has no meaningful ability to connect when I'm not on my home wifi. Most of the time connection on mobile fails.  And if it does work, it takes an unusually long time.

Frustrating scene control The product (Hue lights) are great, but controlling things with this app is tedious. Just give me the ability to set the lights in a room a certain way, controlling color and brightness directly, and save that as a scene. Trying to get what I want by guessing what your software will decide based on a photo is insanely frustrating. I don't mind it as an option, as long as there's also a fine control option for setting up scenes as well. Dumbing something down is not the same thing as being user-friendly.

A poorly-designed app. Colorful and clean-looking, and responds well, but missing the most basic features, like deleting a light from a room or adding another.   It assumes you have just the 3 starter color bulbs and gives no way to discover the white bulbs also powered on in the same room.   It also won't connect to my Hue account (Log in to My Hue) using a Google account, no matter how many times I go through the approval process.   Super frustrating once the initial awe of having that first bulb or two easily controlled wears off.

constant forced bridge updates lock you out of the app imagine you're lying in bed after being up for 20 hours, and you decide you want your bedside light to be a dimmer red, so you reach for your phone to turn the light down. instead, the app forces you to install a large update and you can't control the lights while it's updating. this takes long enough that you have time to, say, write an app review before it finished.

I'm a new user (24 hours)and I'm moderately pleased with the system. I'm using ambient white bulbs and I like several of the available scenes.  What I don't like: - as others have said geofencing doesn't work (presumably because location aware doesn't stay on). Couldn't this be linked to the home wifi system? You can theoretically do that with IFTTT, but that doesn't work either; - there's no facility for lights to come on at random intervals for security purposes (I gather that was available in the older version of the app); - you have to set separate routines for "on" and "off" - why no facility to set lights on for a specified period? - there's no sleep timer (although the Go to Sleep routine works well).

The lack of settings is the biggest issue - for example I cannot edit brightness of existing scene and than save it. Or I cannot make my own scene without using some image (I cannot set the color or white/yellow ambiance by my self) and even if I can mix the right color using some image (guessing) then the brighness is automatically set and I cannot change it and save it (I can change it for this moment, but not save it for the future) Very disappointing...

It's fine... I'm not sure why people are so harsh with their reviews of this app.  As a new user (about 3 weeks) lights turn on and off on the timer, fades work well, scenes work well. The app UI could use a little improvement but all and all it works well. I really wish there was a vacation mode and a hardwired physical switch.

Phillips Hue is a great product but it's held back by this terrible app.  Very few features  and  it literally forgets settings and refuses to save your changes all the time.  There's no excuse for Philips not doing a better job on this  app.  They're hurting their product.

The interface is much better than the original app. I WANT to migrate to this version but they took away basic functionality that I need. There is no way to have a scene exclude/ignore the state of a bulb in this new app. I thought maybe I could work around this by creating an extra 'room' - but NO, they won't allow any light to be assigned to more than one room! I've got a light strip plus over my fish tank. Most scenes need to ignore this light strip since it's on it's own schedule. I put this light strip in it's own 'room' but then there is no way to change all the bulbs at once (like having a 'Movie Night' scene). So back to the old app. Such a shame.

Good hardware. Software not so much. The app is not user friendly. Basic setup is fairly easy but after the initial tutorial of connecting the bridge and your lights, it's like the wild west of figuring out what to do. Naming and grouping lights isn't easy or intuitive and creating specific rooms with specific lighting conditions simply isn't possible. Scene creation is atrocious. Why can't I save a scene's brightness? Why can't I pick color instead of selecting a photo for a color wheel? Why have great hardware then no good way to control it?

Really disappointing... So these lights claimed to be amazing and cost a absolute fortune. Yet they repeatedly lose connectivity to my router. On a 500mb fibre circuit!! The ap itself is terrible, repeatedly failing to remember i gave it full permissions to use (and save) my google log in. Every other ap on my phone uses this data and automatically signs in when i open the ap. Except HUE which repeatedly forces me to re-enter my log in details and re-give permissions to use my google account.  Fix this!

Waste of app. I have dozens of scenes with no easy way to transfer them from the old app. When you do, the picture does not move over. If you decide to recreate the scene from the picture you don't get the options as before to adjust each bulb. instead you are stuck with a random options which just plain sucks. They have taken away the best feature of the app and completely destroyed it. Edit: I tried it again. Still sucks. Even the website does not support the new scenes.

Worst system ever. My biggest problem is when you can't access or make changes to the system until you do an update. That's what this system does. There is no way of saying no or not now to an update. You either do the update or you don't use the system. All I wanted to do is to see if the lights were on. I shouldn't have to be forced to do a freaking update.

Downgrade from previous version The most disappointing thing about this app is that the colour spectrum has been removed! I thought the fact the Phillips colour lights can show millions of colours was the big feature but now you can't select them. I have 2 Iris' either side of a chimney breast and there is no longer a way to link the 2 and pick the same colour for both. Routines that I have set up keep disabling themselves which results in lights not turning off when we want them to. Utter rubbish!

Huge improvement over old app Works well, is much more intuitive and simple to program.  Room for improvement, the lights still don't remember their state state after a power failure, but that isn't a limitation of the app.  Has some limits as far as excluding scenes or bulbs, or say updating a scene with more than three rooms - IE for watching movies...  no ability to randomize schedules or set events relative to sunrise or sunset, still over all works well.

It's like the developers don't even own a Hue setup The app is intuitive enough to get the job done and look good doing it, but for some reason it doesn't have any way to group lights together and change their color outside of creating new scenes. Why this app is missing such a basic feature (which was included in the previous Hue app) boggles my mind. I can't believe that there is no way the developers of this app were using their own lights and never once thought it would be useful to be able to group them all and change all the lights' colors at once.

Very broken The app constantly signs me out of my Hue account and so every time I open the app I have to resign in; and that's even after attempting to reinstall the app. And the "location aware" option fails miserably. It turns itself off as soon as you navigate away from the that setting and there is no other option to save it to stay on. This app needs some work fellas.

It looks a little better than the gen 1 app but the way scenes are implemented is needing more attention.  Scenes need to be a top-line function and should be front and center when you open the app.  Scenes also need to cross "rooms".  Open floor plans may incorporate scenes from multiple rooms as well.  Kitchen/Living room may be close enough together that you would control both in one scene.    All Off should also be truly "All Off".

Right now lights are a random colors picked from the picture used by the scene. Please bring back the functionality that was there in the first version of the app!!

I waited to post a negative review in hopes this would get corrected, but alas... Originally posted on 07/23/2016. No response from developers received. The app doesn't stay logged in and doesn't remember set location for home. Sometimes it won't allow me to stay logged in for location to be attempted. When it does it defaults to a point that says 003 County Road, GARDEN, and some Chinese text. When I tap on the get location button it finds me, but in testing the geo fencing, and based on several anecdotal reports, it does not turn off when I leave home which negates one of the reasons why I purchased this system. Please fix these issues.

Still awful. The old app is far better. I like the new look, but...  1, home/away doesn't work. It won't let me save. 2, how can I create a routine without it being on a timer? Only a few of my lights need to come on at a certain time. And the others I want to choose between multiple 'scenes' when I'm in the mood. Not at set times. 3, it really lacks anything new.

A few things that can be improved:  App itself seems to have problems maintaining connection to My Hue when shifting between WiFi/mobile connection. This causes the app to be caught in limbo, being logged in, but offline, without any option to logout. In 'Scenes' there are three presets, these can be altered, but the change is not saved. The 'Bright' scene is a bit too bright for me. Also it would be nice if I could add 'Routines' and other editorial things offline, which then syncs when I open the app at home.

Horrible after update I liked the app a lot before the update. It doesn't work half the time, disconnects or can't find a light, and it's much harder to pick the exact shade of color you want. I won't buy another light until this app gets updated. It's not even worth using.

Poor Design and Integration For Hue LightStrip Plus, this app does not allow the same colors to be displayed as the old Hue app, specifically deep blues and purples. Themes also become unorganized at random and the capability to copy colors over to different lights as groups has been removed with no alternative feature. When I contacted Philips to ask if these issues would be looked at, I never got a response after weeks of patience...twice. Poor app, poor integration, and poor customer service.

I don't know what everyone is grumbling at. This version is far easier to use than the old one, which was a nightmare to manage when you had more than a small number of lights. It could do with the ability to change groups of lights, or even just copy the setting of one light and paste it to another, but all in all, it does the job much better than the last app.

Works, just not well. I can control the lights with this app most of the time. But a light switch works 100% of the time. So for this app to get a good rating it needs to be better than a light switch. It's not. Routines frequently do not go off, and the widget is sometimes painfully slow at turning something on or off.

My home lighting tech is unusable I have heavily invested in Hue at home. 3 story house with phoenix down lights in all halls, kitchen  and living room and then either blooms hue go's or normal bulbs in bedrooms. Totals about 40 lights. The first app was great but the new versions have rendered my lights unusable. Hue tap that I used to turn lights on / off with exception of certain rooms like kids now no longer works because of an imposed 3 room limit! Light changes have now become slow. Bring back the old functionality that I paid for!

This is my first Hue setup. Only thing I see not working is the Location aware. Everytime I turn it on and go to previous screen then go back it is turned off. Also would like to see a music function built into this app with out having to purchase an additional app. After all I paid almost 200 for a starter kit  Good part of the video demo on their site is setup to show you geo location when you come home and leave home. But does not work.  Tried the previous app and this did work but while I was home the lights would random shut off and the app would crash.

Yup as others are saying this app is a disaster.  The old app was far superior.  I had about 30 great scenes which you could dl from the Philips website and integrate with the app, not any more.    You only get a pathetic 4 extra scenes provided by Philips, the basic app scenes are just that, basic.  If ever there was a case of a dumbed down product ruined to pander to the general casual user, then this is it.  Its a slightly geek product now ruined to pander to muppets who cant even work a Sky remote.  To the 'reviewer' who scoffed saying the app was fine, and that us 'oldies' are scared of change, read above.....  Can I give this a minus?
compound: -0.8627, neg: 0.154, neu: 0.763, pos: 0.083, 

Lost most of its function. The new app looks pretty. But that's about the only good thing. It has lost 60%of its function. Why can I no longer chose specific colours for a specific light? I have to set it up as it's own room to do that. Why does it not carry forward the previous light scenes, or timers? The hub remembers them, the app doesn't show them. The new app loses far more function than it gains.

The app is very easy to use and responsive, however I don't understand why Philips doesn't have Kelvin settings available.

Love it so far So far the hue app and bridge have worked perfectly together.  The response time for on off and dimming is instant and once paired with my Amazon Echo the experience got even better. Controlling the lights with your voice is awesome.  I was also able to link the bridge to my Pebble Time Steel smartwatch with an on/off app which also worked flawlessly and added another level of convenience.  Overall great app and great product Phillips.  Look forward to adding more lights to control in my home.

Pros and cons This app is significantly smoother than the previous. A huge benefit is that this app can identify each respective light/strip with a room. Interface is a lot nicer than the previous. HOWEVER, the old app had the capability of setting timers/alarms felt more customizable. I would recommend both. I personally use this app for scenery and for choosing specific rooms where as thr other one I'd use for a specific task.

Does the team follow PlayStore.... you are trending at 2.5, which translates to "pretty crappy"!

Why remove features This version has a very nice ui, ill give it that but huge feature downgrade from old app. Like the scene abilities from old has been butchered. Simple stuff like for example I have two lights in bedroom and I want them to be exact same color as living room, seems reasonable but not so. If you create a scene for living room it doesn't carry to other rooms. However I still love my Hue lights a lot and with Amazon Echo still awesome but I need to try third party apps for control now

Doesn't work on tablets. (Update: I've switched to the app "All 4 Hue" wich addresses all my needs and more) ......   Please make it possible to select which lights to include in a scene like the gen 1 app instead of all lights in a room. Right now it's close to useless when using hue on tap. And make it possible to add lights to multiple rooms. To make it possible to create scenes for a whole floor for example.

Missing colors Wow Phillips you improve the interface but make it so you can't have green or yellow...  Also no import on scenes from the previous version???  Stupid mistakes.
compound: -0.857, neg: 0.319, neu: 0.573, pos: 0.108, 

Not the best "upgrade" Widgets aren't as reliable as the old app. Also, is it too much to ask for a toggle widget so I don't have to have a million widgets on my screen?
compound: -0.5216, neg: 0.098, neu: 0.902, pos: 0.0, 

Location based features don't work. I can't turn on the Home and Away routine. The connection is not reliable. App UI looks polished but it actually has too many bugs to list down.
compound: 0.0, neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, 

Added some stuff but removed others Why can't I have a routine with individual lights? I don't want to turn all the lights on in a room.. why would make it more of a pain in the ass than before?
compound: -0.9064, neg: 0.261, neu: 0.739, pos: 0.0, 

b"Won't let me adjust already saved scenes and save the changes, is also a bit buggy, listen to comments and fix some bugs and it will be awesome. Love the bulbs and use them all the day, but needs more app support from the maker of them, keep it up??"
compound: 0.9025, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.77, pos: 0.23, 

Unreliable Last on/off home screen widgets do not reliably detect the current state of the lights, so they're effectively useless for turning off lights in another room as you have no idea whether it worked or not.
compound: -0.2698, neg: 0.124, neu: 0.801, pos: 0.075, 

UI improvements, continued madness. The new app lets you group lights into rooms, makes alarms easier, improves geofencing a bit, and exposes a dimming option on the main screen. However: scene picking is now buried one level down, and fewer scenes are displayed so you must scroll more. Creating a new scene *requires* the use of a photo to sample colors from, which is crazy. Getting a photo in is a huge pain; you can't use the website any more, have to use their image picker instead of a normal Android file picker and can't "share" to the app

Now using new version only. I am getting used to this new version. It is basic but does appear to be more stable. No longer keeps asking me to log in.

Retarded With the new room concept I can't set my Hue Tap to operate a single light within a room. Had to define each light in the house as a new room.

Bad Widgets The app is not bad, but the widgets just doesnt work.

Great app for my Philips Hue. Been using the app for two weeks. It's great. Not sure why there are so many negative comments. It does exactly what I need it to do. Routines are great, I can setup lights to come on and off anytime, I can set colours, use photos do just about everything.
compound: 0.8105, neg: 0.09, neu: 0.725, pos: 0.186, 

New app is a lot better As some one who replaced all their lighting with hue the new app and room layout is much better. For those who prefer scene (which you can still do) I would recommend sticking to the old app as it seems you don't like change
compound: 0.7343, neg: 0.039, neu: 0.809, pos: 0.153, 

OK, but It's impossible to edit a once defined scene, unless you just want to shuffle the colors. But just change a single light in an existing g photo-scene is impossible. Who developed this? Just re-think your model. People sometimes want to change their configuration!
compound: 0.4868, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.883, pos: 0.117, 

Scenes didn't lend themselves well to how I wanted to use them, but rooms are perfect. Specific colors CAN be selected: tap the bulb icon in the Lights view on a room to find a full color picker with all the color choices from the previous app. Set up the lights with the colors you want, tap the plus, save as Scene.
compound: 0.8858, neg: 0.021, neu: 0.818, pos: 0.161, 

If it ain't broke don't fix it!! That app was fine before they updated it, now it is utter trash! Might sell my bulbs
compound: 0.6134, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.815, pos: 0.185, 

App doesn't control Hue lights well App constantly is searching for the bridge unless it's updating the bridge. Older app from a year ago was much better and scenes were nicer, light control was instant. I suspect this app sends your inputs to Philips servers then back to your house. It's very slow now.
compound: 0.6908, neg: 0.038, neu: 0.826, pos: 0.136, 

I find using the app to be incredibly frustrating. Creating a scene and applying it to a switch is hard enough but editing it later is worse. If you just want to change the luminescence a couple percent or change the hue a bit, good luck.  The app forces you to use pictures for everything (select by touching the image). There is almost no manual selection of color (or color temperature for Lux) anywhere in the app.  I really miss the color spectrum/temperature selection of the old app! I cannot believe I miss the old app but this version has none of its few good features.
compound: 0.401, neg: 0.124, neu: 0.746, pos: 0.13, 

Horrible app Love the lights but this app makes me want to switch to another brand. - 1 stars
compound: 0.2023, neg: 0.111, neu: 0.69, pos: 0.2, 

Not as bad as others say...just different. At first I agreed with the other reviewers. When I started using it, nothing made sense. It took me 15 minutes just to create a scene. Frustrating.  But after an hour I stopped pushing it to do things the old way and accepted doing things the new way. Suddenly everything started working really well.  In fact, setting up conplicated things like color washes over multiple lights is so easy you might not even notice how it's done. It has some bugs, but give it a try. You can always run V1 concurrently.
compound: 0.7177, neg: 0.034, neu: 0.843, pos: 0.123, 

Focus on original app not whatever this is It's really bad, seriously don't bother downloading this "new" app. It is craptastic.    :(
compound: -0.6526, neg: 0.289, neu: 0.567, pos: 0.144, 

Not and easy upgrade experience Thought it would be a good idea to upgrade to the new app as it had rooms on which I thought would handy. Initially I thought what a big mistake as the old to new just did not seem to work. In the end I upgraded the hub to version 2 and started completely from scratch including all the lights and devices. A long winded task but now it seems to be ok. Still needs some tweaks but getting there.
compound: 0.3285, neg: 0.041, neu: 0.901, pos: 0.058, 

Deplorable I used to think the old app was useless until I saw this one.  This app completely does away with the few usable features the lady app had.  I own several Hue lights, and they are a great example of how to make a useful, affordable, innovative product.  This app, however, is a great example of how to suck the life out of a great product.  Zero stars if I could...
compound: 0.9246, neg: 0.071, neu: 0.705, pos: 0.224, 

Just horrible You have to know how to make smart lights but not a smart app. This app has no flow confusing as hell.. try again
compound: -0.25, neg: 0.226, neu: 0.61, pos: 0.165, 

Used to work, but not anymore Was a nice app, but suddenly stopped functioning... Went back to the old app which still works...
compound: -0.654, neg: 0.211, neu: 0.789, pos: 0.0, 

Broken I used to use my hue system for everything from coming home to a lit room, to making sure the lights turned off when I left, to changing the colors for different video games and such, but I am no longer able to use any GPS features, the scene selection and creation sucks, and the app is overall broken. Things just don't work. If you're going to make a gen 2 of an app, make it better then the first one. I only use this app to update my bridge now. I hope you fix it soon because I was going to buy new lights
compound: -0.0644, neg: 0.108, neu: 0.786, pos: 0.106, 

(Update) Still Forgets Room List Order This app forgets the order in which you arrange the rooms in your main list. This is akin to if your light switches changed their location every time you went to turn one on.
compound: 0.0, neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, 

Quick and easy way to manage lights... Nope! Gotta wait for a 10 minute update to complete!  Really?! This can't be managed in the background?
compound: 0.6293, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.848, pos: 0.152, 

This is not really an improvement So yes, a few really annoying things of the older version got fixed, like the way you choose a color for a single bulb. Still, this bulb forgets the color when you turn it off. And creating a "recipe" to fade off *now* for 5 minutes became impossible. You can only start fading at the same time of the day. As if every person at Phillips goes to bed at exactly the same minute. Don't you use your own product??
compound: 0.3344, neg: 0.063, neu: 0.847, pos: 0.09,

Great concept, bad implementation. The new concept works but many aspects need to be improved inorder to have a fully functional product. For that instance, the V1 app was a better product.
compound: 0.8519, neg: 0.058, neu: 0.67, pos: 0.272, 

Monumentally poor The old app was not great but this is sucky. It's seems less functional than the old app and buggy, you're better off with a third party app

Wanted to like it but... (All thay time between updates and no major concerns addressed?) It's need a lot more polish. Why can't I select individual light brightness while editing a photo scene let alone select a specific light to a certain part of the photo I'm using for the scene? Maybe I'm missing something? Also regarding the widget please allow us to have a "All off". Limiting to 4 rooms doesn't allow me to turn all my rooms off. Feels like you have to jump thru hoops now to turn lights on.
compound: 0.8377, neg: 0.065, neu: 0.77, pos: 0.165,

compound: -0.5632, neg: 0.168, neu: 0.832, pos: 0.0, 

It does what i need. Simple app to configure color and bright. I don't need more. For scenes and special effects I use another apps or build my own with the bridge API.
compound: 0.6808, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.833, pos: 0.167, 

Works well enough Only one bug I have seen, editing a routine and saving it sometimes turns the routine off when you return to the menu, when originally it was on.  Lost a star for a bug, otherwise for a basic controller it works fine and it's hard to beat the price (free as of the time of this review).

Minimalist and stylish app Nice and clean app, that helps you control diffrent light scenes, change colours and dim  all your hue lamps. The updated widget with diffrent scenes and turn off feature is very useful, but I really miss a shortcut for the notification bar. The flat Design is definitely a plus.

Stick with gen 1 The new layout has potential but it is full of bugs and loss of functionality I had in place with gen 1 app.  Why can't scenes transfer from gen 1 to gen 2?  Why aren't my timers all ready in place from 1 to 2?  Why did I have to put in my bridge's ip address for them to find each other?  And then the firmware update fails 4 times for no apparent reason then works the fifth?  Back to gen 1 until further updates come down the pipe.

Does what it says on the tin. I understand there were a lot more features in the gen1 app. That being said, simplifying can be a good thing, as the technology becomes more widespread it's important for the control systems to be easy to pick up and use. This app is just that, simple toggles for rooms, pictures for sponsored themes, and routines that help to automate. It would be nice to see an advanced tab that offers more specific and in-depth features. That said, I'm completely satisfied with what we currently have.
