Truthfully, I haven't even opened this app, but from what I can tell, I'm glad I haven't. Would rate lower if I could, here is the reason, this app just showed up on my phone, threw out a bunch of annoying notifications, can't fully uninstall off my phone (S8+), and here's the kicker, I have auto updates turned OFF on my playstore except when on Wi-Fi, somehow this app was auto updating itself while not on wifi, had to find app in playstore and turn it off.

This app is a massive leap backwards in usability when compared with the old SmartThings app. Automations no longer easy to set up and don't work. Geofencing is no longer accessible. On the main screen you can no longer see which other users are home. I had it set so that when both users left the geo-fenced area the alarm would set now that no longer works. I had it set so that when users came back inside the geofence or someone use the code to unlock the front door the alarm would disarm and that no longer works either. Also seeing the history for each connected device is no longer easy and often impossible. For example if I want to see how many times a motion sensor was triggered that is no longer accessible. I certainly wouldn't trust it to alarm if there was a water leak. I'll say it again that this app makes SmartThings Hub and devices pretty much useless."}

If the app is intended as a primary point of smarthome control, it should enable landscape mode on tablets for convenient tabletop controls. Along similar lines, the app should also include customizable widgets for ease of access. Otherwise it's a solid piece of work that's clearly still evolving. I hope it continues to improve."}

After literally hours of trying to figure it out that's the only way. But it's easier just to use my laptop for sound and phone for video. Also if u try my method with the yeti mic sometimes u may want to reverse that mic cable and plug in the other way around jack and vise versa. Again just turn that mic cable but keep it plugged in both headphone ports on yeti and on phone.

It's easy for the Samsungs of the world to convince themselves that customers were put on this earth to generate revenue and provide them with an endless torrent of consumer behaviour data.

Finally, a plea to Tony of Smart Things support: It is pleasing to see Samsung responding to customer complaints about this and other aspects of this app. But I urge you to not thank me for this feedback and assure me that you have passed it on. I don't mean to shoot the messenger but you should know that these insipid and insincere responses just increase the suspicion and mistrust of the people who pay your collective wages.

The app should not force users to have BT o to add devices. You should prompt users if they want it enabled to find more devices but default it as a must is poor development practices. What if I'm using android on a device without bluetooth, basically samsung connect would then be completely useless. While it's true most phones have bluetooth, they are not the only android devices. TVs android boxes, ect. There are many things out without BT. And there are also reasons why users want BT turned off. Samsung has really dropped the ball on external support as well, they have added almost 0 new compatible devices over the year. Falling far behind other smart hubs. A lot of the bugs have been fixed, but a new driver update today for vacuums broke the history section. You can no longer open up the thumbnail maps to view a larger zoomable version. The automation limitations are bad too. If I want a custom automation I should be able to say for something to do this and this, not this only. Why should I need to make 2 automatons, 1 to change the vacuums power and one to start the vacuum. The schedule I'm the driver is garbage, you can't set days or times or power. Its 1 generic schedule. Not everyone wants to vacuum at the same time every day. Please put some thought into making this more useful. Though you haven't put out any new vacuums so maybe you are getting out of the business and just letting it suffer until people jump ship to a different company ."}

Sensors dont work with lights like in the old app. Lights used to stay on while motion was detected and now they turn off and then sensor turn them on again so they flash for the duration of the delay. Phone presence isnt showing anywhere so I cant determine if the app if showing presence correctly since it is not switching modes or triggering other presence automation. My gfs phone was showing a random name when added as presence. There is no way to change it. Cant seem to find a way to set up modes, away, home, or add new ones. So pretty much I cant use this. My lights, sensors, are sitting home and are pretty much useless. If this goes on for a wile Ill find a way to get my money as this is pure robbery."}

First I read about it... I steered clear but this is a broad stroke app... they didn't make it to annoy but rather help. They need to know what improves it and I'm sure you will get it in time. Help them help you. Don't collapse it before it gets off the ground. It has a good core idea to build on, which is why you are mad. I'd be mad too if they called it Miracle Mind Reader in a Box... Or ... How To Never Want For Anything Ever Again. Give them ideas cause this is so broad that if everyone wanted to see through the Hubble Telescope or Ride along with the next Lunar Mission... they will make it so. They could afford the rocket too just to do one for you. So please help them don't cause other customers with good ideas to run before they try. I did the first time and I'm not easily deterred. Please don't take this as rude or bashing anyone... I'm just giving a point of view and suggestions for a great core idea that is in its infant stages. If ya hold stock in Samsung... you should love this and support it because this app will sell TVs, washers, ovens, lights and eventually installed in your car to start it and work it all by voice. Fortune 500 companies will want and pay to be added on to their list of compatabilities to help sell their product. So buy stock... give helpful suggestions, retire at 40 LOL... and have this App do routine diagnostics to your boat and have it running, ready to board during your drive to the docks to get a small boat to take you out to your big boat. THINK BIG GUYS!!! Don't try to remove the app...HELP IMPROVE IT. Have that million dollar idea that makes Samsung the best product out there. When it works... it will at the very least show in your bullet proof drop off the top floor and bounce in the pool and still finish your conversation from the window, Galaxy 12 SSS+++ Next to the NEW APPLE-F.U.B.A.R. 4SS- sporting a 24k gold apple on the back, Rated #1 by S.N.A.F.U. Tech and seal of approval. The phone that will define you to Friends, family and perfect strangers........... THE HORSE IS OFFICIALLY DEAD (I used my phone to check his vitals) SO I'M OUTTY...PEACE!!!!! ;) :)"}

However, I was really hoping they'd add more programming options for my Powerbot. Ie, set up a weekly automated schedule instead of just daily or once. Back to 3 stars. It still needs a lot of refinement. Update: The March 2018 update has rendered this app useless for me. I'm unable to connect or reconnect my Powerbot since updating to \"Smart Things\". Pretty disappointed, Samsung. Decent app and pretty stable. Took me a while to figure out I had to disconnect my phone from my wifi to connect to a device but connection has been stable since. This app has a lot of potential, but it's functions are still pretty basic. I'm hoping for more customization and control options for my Powerbot R7070. I look forward to what it'll be capable of in the future."}

I typed up a reply by using the app's help and clicked submit. The app just spins a set of tiny dots. Submit doesn't work. I'll reply here. 2) I'm not keen on spending time in documenting my trouble. In October, I submitted a review similar to this one about your earlier app, Smart Home. Had same trouble. Connections were hard to make and hard to keep working. Samsung asked, like you did, for details. I spent a lot of time testing and documenting my problems, emailed them as requested, and I *never* heard anything back. It was a waste of my time.

I would love to have the option to keep, or delete apps that come with our phones. I know technology has made most a bunch of lazy vegetables, but come on, a remote control to control a washing machine? You've got to be joking right? Does the remote control sort our washing into colours, and delicates? Does the remote control put the washing in the machine? So why do we need to have a remote control for such things? I still remember the days when the TV remote control was throwing a thing at one of the kids and telling them to change channel to one of the 4 channels we had back then. Now we have remote controls for everything, and we're getting lazier and lazier. We're getting fatter now too. I remember Christmas day seeing all the kids playing outside with their new bikes, skateboards, and the rest. Now I occasionally see a fat lazy kid every now and then. I'm sick of being forced to have useless laziness apps forced upon me, and I'm not able to remove these apps, even when the phone's storage is so full that it slows down. I'm sick of having to block these apps from sending my private information to people so they can make money, and give others access to stuff that would result in me being convicted and sent to jail. If I were to do the same thing. I would be called a hacker, and the app would be considered malware. If I wanted an app to control my life, I would get a BlackBerry. They are the only phones I trust, and I don't mean the Android BlackBerrys. I can understand why people root their phones. And to top it off, one of your new apps that replace an app that did the same, but had a name change is in Italian, and I not only can't communicate that the stupid app is in Italian because everything is in Italian, and the replies are in Italian, yes, even after I tell them that I don't speak Italian, and I'm located in Australia, and I only speak English, but when I finally get someone to translate the reply, it says that nothing can be done about it."}

The setup was spotty, kept having to unplug and plug 1st unit to get it to recognize. Same with additional 2 units. I laughed out loud when setting up the second unit (in the very next room) and it kept telling me to move closer to the wifi hub. Hmm, you ARE the wifi hub. And wouldn't you know, it did the same thing on the 3rd unit. Unplugging and plugging back in got it going after the 3rd attempt. After getting the wifi part set up, I did the Smartthings part. Just like the 2 extra hubs, one of my z wave switches wasn't being discovered. I HAD to go in manually to do it. Turns out it wanted me to move the switch up once to start the discovery process. It would have been nice for it to mention that in the auto find device so I don't waste time refreshing something that will never be freshened. The wifi performance is so bad and the set up process is more complicated than it needs to be, that just 2 short hours later it's already boxed back up to be returned in the morning. I'll stick with the google wifi mesh router and go buy a Wink. It seems to be better. Oh, and all those permissions...I don't have a Samsung phone, so why on Earth would you need those permissions??"}

What the hell happened with Samsung this last year - I've had more Samsung issues this last year than all the other years combined. What a completely stupid idea to take the Samsung Connect app and rename it to \"SmartThings\" when there is already an app called SmartThings (now labeled SmartThings Classic.) And why were users not notified first and allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want the app update. If I had just bought a SmartThings system and came home to find 2 different apps in the Play store called SmartThings, I would be confused and probably look at the version number of each app - but that would be a mistake because old SmartThings has a higher version number than new SmartThings. At this point I would have just sent it back to Amazon. I never liked or used Smart Connect much - just to set up my wifi hub because that was the only method provided. The original SmartThings app isn't perfect, but it's way superior to the half-baked new app based on Smart Connect - which was used mostly for Bluetooth devices, but is now being shoehorned into a home automation platform. I hope they don't plan on getting rid of the original app and forcing existing SmartThings customers to use the new app exclusively or they're will be a lot of protests and probably a lot of people dumping ST altogether. You see the hub is cheap compared to the many hundreds and hundreds of dollars for sensors, lights, locks, cameras, thermostats, etc. which will all work just fine with another vendors hub. Samsung doesn't own the Zigbee & Z-Wave protocols, nor is there any special proprietary tech in their hubs, so you can just swap out the ST hub for one from a different manufacturer and reattach all of your \"things\" and only be out the cost of the ST hub. Are you listening Samsung? As an IT Engineer myself I can tell you that the golden rule of IT support is to not piss off the users of your platform/network/system. Taking away something they have and are happy with and forcing a migration to something new and frankly inferior, violates the DNPOTU rule. ST Help Desk: please spare me your scripted response about how sorry you are for my inconvenience, inviting me to contact you for support. I've had multiple encounters with your offshore support people who can barely speak English and are oftentimes outright rude... I remember trying to have a conversation with a particular woman who was giving me what I knew to be incorrect information - when I asked to speak to a manager, she told me that she felt like she resolved my issue and that I \"did not deserve to speak to a manager\" then she hung up on me."}

This version of the app still needs the full functionality of the classic. Was 5 stars went to 1 star and now 3 stars. READ THIS: Your Samsung Account just took over your Smartthings Account. That's why nothing is working anymore. This app just took over my smartthings hub. I can't use the password I had set up for my smartthings app and hub. I can only use my Samsung account. Which basically breaks everything that I had set up. Hopefully I can get the text message notifications from my old app security set up to turn off. Some warnings or some form of heads up would be great in the future. The old app was a 5 star product. The new app leaves a lot to be desired so far."}

I like the fact I can watch the TV on my phone.....handy for when I'm watching live football in the living room and cooking in the kitchen at the same time. It would be even better if it had a track pad like the one provided in Samsung Smart View which makes my TV's browser so much more usable. The only way to stop the app running seems to be to \"force stop\" it in settings. It needs an exit button. I object to permitting this app access to my contacts and location. You do not need to know these. I should be allowed to use this app with these permissions turned off."}

Your automation system performs one last check of your devices by turning off lights, locking doors, adjusting the temperature etc. All of a sudden your Amazon echo tells you that your front door is open.You jump up in bed and the lights in your master bedroom suite blink a warm shade of blue. You relax because you know that the presence sensor your significant other is carrying will cause your lights to blink blue. You know that an unknown intruder would cause your lights to blink red in your room and in your children's rooms. Your Amazon echo greets your significant other, and turns on some soft lighting. Now your significant joins you upstairs. Ten minutes later the lights dim to 10% as they change to a soft lavender, The front and back doors locks, the lights downstairs turn off and Echo states that your home is secure. That's how my home functions and I love it. Unfortunately I have to use various programs etc to make it work. I wish we were able to completely program all these functions from one app. PS Samsung, hire me!!"}

Cannot integrate with other samsung products and apps but I am forced to use it. So I was asked for more...I initially purchased a Samsung Smartthings Hub and peripherals, and was quite happy with them, using the Smartthings App. So I thought about a robot vacuum, and decided to get the \"Smartthings compatible\" one from Samsung....Well, not really, The vacuum must use Samsung Connect, which I cannot get to talk to the Smartthings Hub unless I totally re-register, and I assume lose all the work I have done. On top of this, The vacuum has lost its connection to my WiFi router, and cannot reconnect. I thought that maybe if I deleted it from the Samsung Connect App, I could re-add it...but there does not appear to be any delete function...apparently nothing ever breaks. So as I see it now I have a vacuum that does not work, because it needs the wifi, but i cannot get it to work because of the app (which I think only works on phones - lest we try to use a real device) Updated 1/16/18, still horrible. This is the only way to unify my Samsung smart devices (all samsung brand). And this interface has significantly less functionality than the smartthings interface. Also no guidance on what the Samsung road map is...."}

No permission was given to add this... what the hell! Updated this review today, but still one star because I can't give it zero stars. Months later now and the app is now wanting to add more updated version (which I still don't need) to my overweight bloated phone. Go ahead and piss off your customer's Samsung. Play fair for a change and let the customer decide for a change if they need an app. Quit force-feeding us stuff we don't want or need. Offers are welcome, but forcing a app is poor business practic. What happened to the old saying, \"The customer is ALWAYS right\"??? I paid full price for this unlocked phone and I should have the right to not have stuff added to it that I don't need. This is a great way to insure my next phone won't be Samsung. I bought an expensive phone to prevent the bloatware. Please Samsung, if you are not going to stop adding junk at least give us the option to delete this stuff if we don't need it. I get VERY suspicious of ANY app that forces itself on me. Tonight when you go to sleep, I hope your car dealership attaches a huge trailer to your car, puts 4 truck tires in the your trunk that you can't ever remove, then you wake up to three ovens added to your kitchen stove, and an extra 6 showerheads mounted all over your house and three screaming, untoilet trained, toddlers that you must now raise, house, feed, and educate. What? You never asked for all that. Tough, you have no choice. You have to keep it all. What? No room for it all and those three screaming children. Too bad, guess, you'll just have to buy a new bigger home to house it all and take on a 2nd and 3rd job to pay for it all. Not my problem. My next phone will never be from such a pushy company, I just need a simple phone that won't annoyed me with constant updates that are useless to me and apparently 50% of the other Samsung smartphone owners who bothered to respond with comments about this update being worthless to them too. To those of you who have it, like it, and use it, good for you but just wait until you wake up tomorrow morning and your little car's trunk is full of truck tires that you must keep, good luck with your now extremely poor gas mileage. Whoever from Samdug (yes, that's not a spelling error) who cares that you will pass on our complaints. Just don't tell us you are sorry we are unhappy, DO SOMETHING positive and LISTEN to your customer's for once. Or perhaps your customer's will disappear and go to a company who will."}
