I like being able to control the thermostat while away from the house but one key feature that is missing is geofence. When I first installed the app it worked great. Since then I've installed two app updates and now geofence doesn't work. I can set it up, but it just doesn't do anything. Another feature I would like is to be able to set up \"peak\" and \"off-peak\" times so the thermostat can easily be set up to pre-cool or pre-heat during the off peak time and minimize on-peak run time. A second feature I would like is more fan control. I like being able to run the fan for a minimum time per hour but I don't need that to happen when no one is home. Ecobee needs to add this control in the comfort settings not solely equipment settings."}

It is a little slow for sure, but that's acceptable for how often I use it. Would still like the following: 1. Allow tablets to view it in portrait mode as well as landscape. Not a huge issue, but it's annoying. 2. Android widgets! This seems like an obvious candidate for widgets, and in fact my old wireless thermo had one, albeit not the greatest. 3. Speed. As I said, it's acceptable, but could be better. Don't know if they are just using a WebView, or one of the \"cross platform\" toolkits, but it kind of feels like that, and if so, a native UI would probably be better in the long run."}

Thank you for including it with the latest version. HOWEVER... Perhaps in the next update you can include a version of the geofence THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!! This is ridiculous! The developers have taken a perfectly fine, perfectly working application, and \"updated\" it to the point where valuable features are left out, and then \"updated\" it again to include valuable features that don't work. Hats off to the geniuses that have destroyed any value that this application ever had. If I wanted to manually put my system into, and take it out of away mode, I could do that from the main control without wasting my time with this useless app. Thanks for nothing. 23 MAR 18 Review: Why on earth would an update to an app be pushed through and have useful features such as the geofence REMOVED? Yes, I know it says that a new updated geofence will be coming soon. But sending an update without all the previous features is idiotic. Thanks for the loss of the best feature Ecobee had."}

{"Author": "Donna Cooper", "Date": "March 23, 2018", "Stars": "Rated 1 stars out of five stars", "Text": "The latest Android update is a step backwards in a number of ways. The most ridiculous \"feature\" now results in the thermostats being presented and sorted in random order on the main screen. So if you have multiple thermostats in multiple buildings, you are viewing your list in random order. Worse, you can drag and drop the thermostats to sort differently, but that's just a tease: the new order doesn't save and reverts immediately back to the random sort order! You can group the thermostats, but that just displays them in group order, and that list doesn't let you access each thermostat... it's just a passive list! So you have to return to the main (random) list to actually manage your devices. What makes these dysfunctions maddening is that the old app actually handled multiple thermostats well! You used to be able to view and access your devices within groups on the main screen. I have 11 thermostats in 4 buildings, and they're now presented in a completely ridiculous sequence. Also, the old app used to present each device in the same familiar interface as the wall thermostat's, so your interaction was the same. Now for some unknown reason, the app interface shows the temp and range in a completely different way from the wall units. Whoever redesigned this app should actually be forced to use it, and perhaps they should have looked at the previous app. This new app is embarrassing for ecobee, especially for any customer who has more than one unit or more than one building or group, customers whom I would think ecobee would not want to alienate."}

No more worrying about the temp in the kids rooms.Wiith this thermostat we can prioritize their rooms or just let them be averaged in with all of the other readings from different locations in the home.

It also doesn't provide tailored guidance based on your specific system, for instance I have a heat pump but it kept asking me questions about how I wanted the Ecobee to control my furnace. I don't have a furnace, why are you trying to control a furnace, do you think I have a furnace??? There were also steps that asked you to confirm whether you had completed a task they hadn't told you to do yet (install the C-wire). It's like they didn't test the thing at all. Seeing as most people aren't HVAC experts and Ecobee is trying to make using their product easy, you would think they would have made sure the installation guide was robust, but I ended up calling support half way through because the app wasn't cutting it."}

It seems like a poor choice to me not to invest in an engineering team with native app expertise, probably as a cost saving measure. Regardless of what it's built with, consumers like me have certain expectations about performance and quality that are simply lacking here. It's too bad, because the design is actually quite nice. The app also has an unfortunate bug. When I change the minimum temperature, for example, it often changes to a different number than what is previewed. Sometimes it even changes the maximum temperature. It can take a few tries to get close enough to the temperature range I want. All in all, the thermostat itself is fine, but the app will probably lose me as a costumer."}

When I go to weather, the numbers are not where they are supposed to be. The app also handles the back button in a way that makes the app buggy. It's like a history of where you have been instead of just going to the previous menu. The developers should change this which would probably make the app quicker. There is probably a reason why they did it this way, but I don't know if it's the best way to handle this small detail."}

So if they are down the app is useless. The second issue is the layout and gui is moronic. You could easily put everything on one screen and allow for specific temp input. Dragging a bar to a number is the lowest form of programming. The only reason it deserves 2 stars is because it actually exists and you can stumble through controlling your thermostat."}

My biggest disappointment is that I can't view the logs from the phone UI like I can in the tablet UI. It's also disappointing that the tablet UI requires horizontal scrolling. It's basically the website jammed into a container that doesn't quite fit tablets as well as it should. The logs are also always an hour behind current activity. In theory, the app should be able to \"pull\" the latest data from the thermostat but doesn't for some reason. The information itself is presented in a dramatically different manner on phone vs. tablet (and also the website). Ideally, you will re-evaluate all of these differences and make a more holistic and consistent experience across devices. A truly responsive app will work great on any device at any orientation. I know it's not easy but there are plenty of great UI designers addressing challenges like this. This is the kind of thing that separates a decent app from an awesome app."}

The Ecobee 3 is by far the best and most complete kit for a comparable price. The only improvement I see is being able to see the remote sensor (lil bee) in the app, but I'm sure that is coming soon. The occupancy sensing of the stat and lil bee works better than the competition and the temperature averaging is a great feature. I was also very impressed that it came with a PEK module for those who may not have all the wires required. Great job!"}

There are a few things I'd like to see improved: 1. Most important \u2013 option to see remote sensors' data. It's really important to see that information from the app, and not only from the thermostat. 2. Icons are currently low-res, and it really shows, especially giving a slick look of the app. This can definitely be improved, as I assume there are hi-res (vector) icons available for your designers/developers' use."}

The interface lags and it takes many clicks to do simple things such as switch equipment on/off or heat/cool. A little simplification would go a long way. Response is also a bit of an issue as I often have to press several times to get a response, especially when choosing heat or cool modes. Also, I have found that I can only have 4 cycles in the schedule and I would like to have more."}

It would be more ideal to even include the HomeIQ data as part of this app so as to not have to log in with a browser. It just seems like this app should be an \"everything included\" app. Please also add ALL configuration settings from the thermostat to the app. That will be VERY helpful!
