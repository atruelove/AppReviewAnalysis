I'm a crypto currency miner and I love the fact I can track my usage and be able to remotely reboot my computers. Only thing I don't like is the power button that is actually on the device itself. Sometimes I reach to touch the wemo to see if it's hot and I accidentally switch the power off as the switch is far too sensitive. Also it's rated at 1800 watts but when I push 12/1300 watts thru it, it gets very hot. This makes me a tad bit nirvous... But other than that works like a charm."}

Connecting the plug was horrible, had to click on \"try again\" numerous times. Once connected, tried to name it, it disconnects over and over again only to find out the name hasn't changed. Did that 5 times, then gave up and clicked on save. The app connected to my WiFi. Everything finally seemed to have worked. Linked it to Google home, tried to turn it on and off by voice, home acknowledges the command but nothing happens with the plug. Found out there's an update but no way to manually update it. Found a workaround, when I click on \"update now\" it takes me to a Window to update the device. Clicked on \"accept and update\" and guess what....nothing happens.

Ill keep trying, but if I cant find a solution to remotely controlling the plug over my VPN, Ill have to return the device. Major bummer.  Just got this (9/9/17.) So far so good, this wemo MINI is everything Ive been looking for: 1. A connected outlet, providing simple on/off control from my phone/tablet devices. 2. It HAD to be accessible from the internet, NOT through a wemo account/servers, but instead over my own VPN connection to my LAN. 3. An app with reasonable permissions, that I can deny on a per-feature basis, without breaking the app. 4. Finally, I need it to be reliable. (Manual control of firmware updates should contribute to that, but Id like to see a detailed change log displayed when they are offered.) This wemo device and app are, so far, on par with my Hue lights for function, ease of use, and flexibility. If this continues to hold true, I can see more wemo devices in my future. wemo, so far, is a pleasant surprise, in a world of over reaching, flaky, and consumer-hostile software, hardware, and services."}

I have an issue with how the application shows me a loading screen, then it shows me a connecting to network screen, then it shows me the devices if they are detected, (they fail about 20% of the time) then it has to refresh the status on all devices. This means if i want to turn on the light for a room with my device i have to wait somewhere from 20 sec to 2 min to flip a light switch.  You need to cache this data and refresh it in the background, and use push messages on status changes for updates.  The app is also lacking widgets for the home screen, a fast easy way to toggle devices is critical for ease of use.  There is also a problem that the application times out frequently when creating rules or the failing to save a rule."}

Setting up wemo mini not a streamlined workflow. Would have thought twice about buying these if Id seen the app rating first. To get 5 stars, app needs streamlined workflow for setting up new wemo minis without the confusion for android devices and auto network select. Would also need a much more responsive app overall. The time between a tap and a reaction is several seconds and there is often no indication that a tap occured and the app was doing things. My guess is that wemo outsourced the creation of this app without a lot of QA on the release because internally developed apps rarely have this poor of an experience."}

To add to the commonly used phrases - poor design and hit or miss usage. The firmware needs to be updated literally every day, and I don't mean that in the hyperbolic sense.   I mean every day I open the app and it prompts me to download the latest firmware, rendering the app unusable for an hour or more. I use a VPN and sometimes the bulbs are recognized and sometimes they aren't, which means I need to turn off the VPN, open the app and turn on my lights, and then turn on my VPN again. I implore you to buy any other brand of smart bulb or switch instead of this very mediocre technology. I took the cheap route and I regret it.  I own 7 bulbs, a wemo link, an insight and a switch. It took 4 support people and over 5 hours of talk time to get the products working properly. I was expecting the seamless setup of other home automation devices I have and this was definitely not seamless.

You will get used to a circling waiting symbol and end up force quitting the app to make it go away. When you first set up you have to turn off Wifi scanning on your phone. However the instructions are for an old version of Android and don't work with new versions. I have a Pixel\u200b so it's not like I have a weird version of Android. Also, I accidentally mistyped my Wi-Fi password (it's complex) and the app notified me but wouldn't let me change it because no Wi-Fi networks would show up in it. I suggest if you have any problems to uninstall and reinstall the app, sometimes multiple times. I think Belkin is one of those companies that only cares about iPhones and Android is just an afterthought. Or they are trying too hard to automate everything and it's just not working right."}

Belkin tech support were great but difficult to contact (Pacific time) being 16 hours behind Australia &amp; over 40 minutes on hold to get to a person.Some issues have been fixed but the inability to set schedules still persists. You can set an on time but not an off time. If you have issues uninstall the Wemo app &amp; then reinstall it as this can resolve old data issues. We still have unresolved issues but these hopefully can ultimately be fixed so here's hoping. Web access is very fast &amp; reliable so thats a plus."}

{"Author": "Ross Ji", "Date": "July 5, 2017", "Stars": " Rated 1 stars out of five stars ", "Text": " <span class=\"review-title\"></span> Pros: Sometimes works.  Cons: 1. Very unreliable.  At time you turn the switch on and it tells you that its but it isn't.  2. If the power goes off and on or the Internet is disconnected for a seconds, the device is likely not to operate and you actually have no way of knowing if it has worked or not unless you're sitting next to it. 3. The device (wemo switch) makes a high pitch whistling sound which is already giving me a headache. I can't have this in my home.  4. Once connected to power takes a couple of minutes to connect to the same wifi to which it was connected 5 minutes ago. (Seriously which technology are you guys using? ) I should tell you that I have got the latest wemo switch, the latest wemo app and have fully upgraded the firmware. Belkin guys, if you wanna make an improvement, the most important aspect is reliability. These devices are no good unless they can report their on/off status 100% accurate. Also do something about the whistling noise.  I have checked two devices and they both had the same issue. I'm returning this for good."}

Reset the links, reset the light bulbs, restarted my android and reinstalled the Android app 5 times each. Right after finishing the set up, it works for 10 seconds then the app forgets everything and goes back to the first help screen again. I am guessing the app is faulty. Any help would be appreciated. This is an expensive joke for $100! A very slow joke! How about having this on two phones? Only one person can not have the keys? Hit and miss and not reliable, sometimes it says something is off or on but it is wrong! Why? The hardware is yours which you charged us more than $100 for it, the software is yours too and you can not make them work together!  By the time it gets loaded I can catch a taxi, go to airport, board a plane, go home, switch off the lights, make sure it is off, and come back! Using this at home? Forget about it, just turn off the switch manually. According to Google 0.5 million to 1 million people downloaded this, let's say also 1 million IPhone users downloaded this. Let's say a quarter of those bought more than one, maybe 2, 3, 4 or more for their business or home. It makes up to $300 million product! Let's say $200 million product from a company who earns billions. And you still managed to make it as useless as possible. Well done.  And don't you see I gave you one star, stop asking please!"}

However that is because it is the default view for no schedule! Very poor user experience throughout the application.  Turning the WeMo Insight on or off via the application frequently causes it to lose communication with the device. I couldn't figure out what would make it work again but it seems to resume working after several minutes. But it also stops working once I issue another on/off command again. This is a very poor experience.
